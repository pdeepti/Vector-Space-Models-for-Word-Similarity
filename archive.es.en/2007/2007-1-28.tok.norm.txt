" " i will travel with the impression that we must use this window of opportunity because otherwise there will be great threats " to the region . merkel whose country heads the european union until the end of june will meet leaders in egypt , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates and kuwait during her visit . she again underlined her backing for the international quartet group , consisting of the european union , russia , the united nations and the united states the group meets in washington friday to revive efforts aimed at resolving the israeli-palestinian conflict . merkel had joined eu foreign policy chief javier solana on a visit to washington earlier this month which observers said was designed to remind the united states of the middle east 's importance as it focuses on a new iraq strategy . merkel warns that time is running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israel-hezbollah war brought tensions to a head after talks with jordanian king abdullah ii in berlin , merkel said that germany and jordan have a joint interest in supporting the peace process in the middle east .
" the past summer has taught us that time is running out , " said merkel , referring to the war between israel and the radical lebanese hezbollah movement . berlin would contribute to the process , alongside the eu 's role in the so-called mideast quartet . at the quartet 's next meeting on february 2 in washington , israelis and palestinians should be encouraged to extend their bilateral dialogue , merkel said . however , it was impossible to secure peace between the two sides without the region 's support , she said , adding that it was vital " to coordinate our individual steps very intensively " in the coming weeks . agreement on strengthening lebanese sovereignty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah and merkel agreed to support beirut the two leaders had also strongly agreed to strengthen the sovereignty of lebanon " to do everything in order to facilitate the success of the government of -lrb- lebanese prime minister fouad -rrb- seniora , " merkel said . abdullah criticized " certain attempts from outside " of undermining the democratic process in lebanon . riots between pro-government students and supporters of hezbollah had left three people dead and 110 wounded this week .

one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .
" the internet is like an airline , " he said .
" it offers an alternative ; just like television and the radio , the internet is now just another option , another airline you can take .
they will continue to operate in unity and never destroy each other . " cross-border licensing problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists can make huge bounds through myspace even the big media companies seem to hold no fear of the future .
emi , the biggest music publisher in the world , also has high hopes for promotional platforms and the benefits they can bring their artists . " we think that social networks and the progressive expansion of promotion are very promising , " said emi president roger faxon .
" if we create the right licensing system for this , the music market will continue to blossom .
if not , the pessimists will be proved right and piracy will blossom , but we will not allow this . " and there lies the biggest of the problems facing the music industry in such a self-empowered world : each region has its own licensing systems .
in europe , the record companies were slow to react to the impact of digitization and failed to secure copyrights . now , according to emi 's faxon , international media giants are combining and catching up fast . " we have cooperated with germany 's gema and britain 's alliance -lrb- artist copyright organizations -rrb- to create a pan-european copyright protection organization which simplifies licensing , " he said . taking on illegal downloading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : licensing partnerships can help tackle music piracy as well as securing cross-border licensing agreements for digital media , emi is involved in promoting download services which aim to compete with illegal sites .
its own spiral frog service was set up to provide consumers with higher quality downloads than they could get from file sharing and peer-to-peer platforms . users can download the music for free but the artists do not lose out ; reaping financial benefits from the advertising revenue . the artists themselves still see a silver lining to being illegally downloaded or having their work bootlegged and shown / played on the internet .
will.i.am , singer with the black eyed peas , said that even if someone records part of his band 's show on a mobile phone and then posts it on open broadcasting platform youtube , therefore potentially damaging sales of the show 's dvd release , it 's still not all bad news . a silver lining to music piracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no such thing as bad publicity ...
" our name is out there , " the rapper , producer and composer said .
" it 's on everyone 's lips who saw that clip and that is useful when you 're touring .
if people see you on youtube and like what they see , then they will want to come and see you live . " what does make the black eyed peas nervous is how the music industry reacts to the demise of the cd . " the cd has no market anymore , " will.i.am said .
" the kids today who have all these new toys do n't care about this format that their brother was into years ago .

but some groups in germany say not all biofuels are created equal . " there should not be a green light for all biofuels , " said imke lübbeke , an energy expert for the german world wildlife fund , adding that some renewable sources of energy are not necessarily good for the environment . but while the wwf and other environmental organizations said that it is irresponsible to cut down large swaths of carbon dioxide absorbing rainforest to make way for renewable crops that could potentially be the power sources of the future , there is still room for europe expand its fields of biofuel producing plants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still has space for more fields of renewable energy producing plants " a million hectares of farmland , that 's 10 percent of cultivable land in germany , are fallow and this standstill is even supported by the government , " said jürgen zeddies , an agricultural economist at the university of hohenheim , adding that some of these fields could be used to grown renewable material for fuels . danger for local flora other environmental protection groups , however , warn that using all the fields for fuel material could lead to the extinction of a number of plant types in germany as soil properties change due to the new crops . that will make it crucial to find environmentally friendly ways of creating biofuel , lübbeke said . " we have to be careful that biofuel is made in an environmentally friendly way , " she said .
" it does n't make any sense to sacrifice important protected areas or soil and water protection zones for rapeseed and sugar beets for biofuels . " biomass is a solution that lübbeke and zeddies agreed could be an intelligent way to create power and heat in an environmentally friendly way , especially as most of these types of energy comes from coal power plants . replacing the worst polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is already mixed into nearly all germany 's diesel pumps " the question is always what types of energy you are using bioenergy to replace , " said nils rettenmaier of heidelberg 's institute for energy and environmental research .
" and it makes sense to replace the ones that are the most carbon heavy . " rettenmaier added that he feels biofuels are often not used as intelligently as they could be and called on the auto industry not to just make engines that use biofuels but to make more efficient engines in general . " the automobile industry uses biofuels for its lobbying work , " he said .
" it tries to turn attention from its task of building efficient vehicles . " there may be a ray of light coming for rettenmaier and other environmental protection groups from the european union next week .

but some groups in germany say not all biofuels are created equal . " there should not be a green light for all biofuels , " said imke lübbeke , an energy expert for the german world wildlife fund , adding that some renewable sources of energy are not necessarily good for the environment . but while the wwf and other environmental organizations said that it is irresponsible to cut down large swaths of carbon dioxide absorbing rainforest to make way for renewable crops that could potentially be the power sources of the future , there is still room for europe expand its fields of biofuel producing plants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still has space for more fields of renewable energy producing plants " a million hectares of farmland , that 's 10 percent of cultivable land in germany , are fallow and this standstill is even supported by the government , " said jürgen zeddies , an agricultural economist at the university of hohenheim , adding that some of these fields could be used to grown renewable material for fuels . danger for local flora other environmental protection groups , however , warn that using all the fields for fuel material could lead to the extinction of a number of plant types in germany as soil properties change due to the new crops . that will make it crucial to find environmentally friendly ways of creating biofuel , lübbeke said . " we have to be careful that biofuel is made in an environmentally friendly way , " she said .
" it does n't make any sense to sacrifice important protected areas or soil and water protection zones for rapeseed and sugar beets for biofuels . " biomass is a solution that lübbeke and zeddies agreed could be an intelligent way to create power and heat in an environmentally friendly way , especially as most of these types of energy comes from coal power plants . replacing the worst polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is already mixed into nearly all germany 's diesel pumps " the question is always what types of energy you are using bioenergy to replace , " said nils rettenmaier of heidelberg 's institute for energy and environmental research .
" and it makes sense to replace the ones that are the most carbon heavy . " rettenmaier added that he feels biofuels are often not used as intelligently as they could be and called on the auto industry not to just make engines that use biofuels but to make more efficient engines in general . " the automobile industry uses biofuels for its lobbying work , " he said .
" it tries to turn attention from its task of building efficient vehicles . " there may be a ray of light coming for rettenmaier and other environmental protection groups from the european union next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 28.01.2007 music industry eyes digital age with growing optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers and sellers mingle with the movers and shakers at midem 2007 in cannes at the 2007 midem music fair in cannes , artists and executives from the music and media industries come to discuss and promote the latest fads and trends .
one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .
" the internet is like an airline , " he said .
" it offers an alternative ; just like television and the radio , the internet is now just another option , another airline you can take .
they will continue to operate in unity and never destroy each other . " cross-border licensing problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists can make huge bounds through myspace even the big media companies seem to hold no fear of the future .
emi , the biggest music publisher in the world , also has high hopes for promotional platforms and the benefits they can bring their artists . " we think that social networks and the progressive expansion of promotion are very promising , " said emi president roger faxon .
" if we create the right licensing system for this , the music market will continue to blossom .
if not , the pessimists will be proved right and piracy will blossom , but we will not allow this . " and there lies the biggest of the problems facing the music industry in such a self-empowered world : each region has its own licensing systems .
in europe , the record companies were slow to react to the impact of digitization and failed to secure copyrights . now , according to emi 's faxon , international media giants are combining and catching up fast .

one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .
" the internet is like an airline , " he said .
" it offers an alternative ; just like television and the radio , the internet is now just another option , another airline you can take .
they will continue to operate in unity and never destroy each other . " cross-border licensing problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists can make huge bounds through myspace even the big media companies seem to hold no fear of the future .
emi , the biggest music publisher in the world , also has high hopes for promotional platforms and the benefits they can bring their artists . " we think that social networks and the progressive expansion of promotion are very promising , " said emi president roger faxon .
" if we create the right licensing system for this , the music market will continue to blossom .
if not , the pessimists will be proved right and piracy will blossom , but we will not allow this . " and there lies the biggest of the problems facing the music industry in such a self-empowered world : each region has its own licensing systems .
in europe , the record companies were slow to react to the impact of digitization and failed to secure copyrights . now , according to emi 's faxon , international media giants are combining and catching up fast .

but some groups in germany say not all biofuels are created equal . " there should not be a green light for all biofuels , " said imke lübbeke , an energy expert for the german world wildlife fund , adding that some renewable sources of energy are not necessarily good for the environment . but while the wwf and other environmental organizations said that it is irresponsible to cut down large swaths of carbon dioxide absorbing rainforest to make way for renewable crops that could potentially be the power sources of the future , there is still room for europe expand its fields of biofuel producing plants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still has space for more fields of renewable energy producing plants " a million hectares of farmland , that 's 10 percent of cultivable land in germany , are fallow and this standstill is even supported by the government , " said jürgen zeddies , an agricultural economist at the university of hohenheim , adding that some of these fields could be used to grown renewable material for fuels . danger for local flora other environmental protection groups , however , warn that using all the fields for fuel material could lead to the extinction of a number of plant types in germany as soil properties change due to the new crops . that will make it crucial to find environmentally friendly ways of creating biofuel , lübbeke said . " we have to be careful that biofuel is made in an environmentally friendly way , " she said .
" it does n't make any sense to sacrifice important protected areas or soil and water protection zones for rapeseed and sugar beets for biofuels . " biomass is a solution that lübbeke and zeddies agreed could be an intelligent way to create power and heat in an environmentally friendly way , especially as most of these types of energy comes from coal power plants . replacing the worst polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is already mixed into nearly all germany 's diesel pumps " the question is always what types of energy you are using bioenergy to replace , " said nils rettenmaier of heidelberg 's institute for energy and environmental research .
" and it makes sense to replace the ones that are the most carbon heavy . " rettenmaier added that he feels biofuels are often not used as intelligently as they could be and called on the auto industry not to just make engines that use biofuels but to make more efficient engines in general . " the automobile industry uses biofuels for its lobbying work , " he said .
" it tries to turn attention from its task of building efficient vehicles . " there may be a ray of light coming for rettenmaier and other environmental protection groups from the european union next week .

but some groups in germany say not all biofuels are created equal . " there should not be a green light for all biofuels , " said imke lübbeke , an energy expert for the german world wildlife fund , adding that some renewable sources of energy are not necessarily good for the environment . but while the wwf and other environmental organizations said that it is irresponsible to cut down large swaths of carbon dioxide absorbing rainforest to make way for renewable crops that could potentially be the power sources of the future , there is still room for europe expand its fields of biofuel producing plants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still has space for more fields of renewable energy producing plants " a million hectares of farmland , that 's 10 percent of cultivable land in germany , are fallow and this standstill is even supported by the government , " said jürgen zeddies , an agricultural economist at the university of hohenheim , adding that some of these fields could be used to grown renewable material for fuels . danger for local flora other environmental protection groups , however , warn that using all the fields for fuel material could lead to the extinction of a number of plant types in germany as soil properties change due to the new crops . that will make it crucial to find environmentally friendly ways of creating biofuel , lübbeke said . " we have to be careful that biofuel is made in an environmentally friendly way , " she said .
" it does n't make any sense to sacrifice important protected areas or soil and water protection zones for rapeseed and sugar beets for biofuels . " biomass is a solution that lübbeke and zeddies agreed could be an intelligent way to create power and heat in an environmentally friendly way , especially as most of these types of energy comes from coal power plants . replacing the worst polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is already mixed into nearly all germany 's diesel pumps " the question is always what types of energy you are using bioenergy to replace , " said nils rettenmaier of heidelberg 's institute for energy and environmental research .
" and it makes sense to replace the ones that are the most carbon heavy . " rettenmaier added that he feels biofuels are often not used as intelligently as they could be and called on the auto industry not to just make engines that use biofuels but to make more efficient engines in general . " the automobile industry uses biofuels for its lobbying work , " he said .
" it tries to turn attention from its task of building efficient vehicles . " there may be a ray of light coming for rettenmaier and other environmental protection groups from the european union next week .

" i have to admit that al gore was the tipping point , " klaus kleinfeld , chief executive of german electronics group siemens , admitted in one debate , referring to the 2006 film about global warming made by the former us presidential candidate . global trade talks got a lift on saturday when leading ministers meeting on the sidelines of the event agreed on the principle of re-starting stalled world trade organization talks . hopes for new round of doha trade talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's lamy saw hope in the davos trade talks the doha round of wto talks was suspended last july by wto director general pascal lamy after the european union , the united states and developing countries became deadlock . " my sense of the -lrb- trade -rrb- meeting was a positive one , " said brazilian foreign minister celso amorim afterwards .
" i left with a higher feeling of optimism . " the doha round was launched by wto members in the qatari capital doha in 2001 with the aim of reducing trade barriers for the benefit of poor countries . in addition to several debates on iraq and the middle east , the israeli-palestinian conflict took centre stage on thursday evening when palestinian president mahmoud abbas shared a stage with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni and deputy prime minister shimon peres . both sides expressed a desire for peace based on the idea of an independent palestinian state , an expression of goodwill at a time when international action to solve the conflict is gathering momentum . middle east negotiations preparing to restart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and abbas talked peace on the sidelines " we are ready , as of now , to start serious negotiations with our israeli neighbors , " abbas told the audience . us secretary of state condoleezza rice is due to meet with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and abbas in the next few weeks and she will also host a meeting of the middle east peace quartet on friday . the quartet includes the united states , the european union , russia and un secretary general ban ki-moon . the gathering , set in the glitzy davos ski resort in the swiss alps , this year featured appearances from the leaders of brazil , britain , germany , mexico , the philippines and south africa , who mingled with the leading names in business . above all , the event serves as a useful gauge of the preoccupations of policymakers and the world 's business elite , with the shift of economic and political influence to asia giants india and china another dominant theme in 2007 . development and trade focus on asia , india and africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair , bono and liberian president sirleaf set out a vision for africa development issues and poverty in africa were addressed by pop star and campaigner bono and british prime minister tony blair , while bill gates revealed how his global immunization program gavi had vaccinated 138 million children since 2000 . bono was a rare exception as a celebrity in davos this year after the organizer of the event , klaus schwab , decided to reduce the number of showbiz stars in attendance . hollywood a-listers had threatened to overshadow the event in recent history and outshine the corporate clientele who pay from 35,000 swiss francs -lrb- 22,000 euros , 28,000 dollars -rrb- to attend . this year also saw a move to embrace the online community , featuring a discussion of second life , the computer-based virtual world , and an internet site to aggregate blogs written about the event . davos was not all serious discussion however , with attendees invited to join seminars on topics such as " why do brains sleep ? " and " a blueprint for human settlement of the solar system " . another seminar promised to examine the issue of self-esteem - hardly a scarce commodity in the rarefied world of davos . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers back resumption of stalled doha trade talks in davos ministers from 24 key trading nations on saturday backed a " quick resumption " of the frozen doha round of global trade talks after a meeting in davos , the swiss economics ministry said .

one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .
" the internet is like an airline , " he said .
" it offers an alternative ; just like television and the radio , the internet is now just another option , another airline you can take .
they will continue to operate in unity and never destroy each other . " cross-border licensing problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists can make huge bounds through myspace even the big media companies seem to hold no fear of the future .
emi , the biggest music publisher in the world , also has high hopes for promotional platforms and the benefits they can bring their artists . " we think that social networks and the progressive expansion of promotion are very promising , " said emi president roger faxon .
" if we create the right licensing system for this , the music market will continue to blossom .
if not , the pessimists will be proved right and piracy will blossom , but we will not allow this . " and there lies the biggest of the problems facing the music industry in such a self-empowered world : each region has its own licensing systems .
in europe , the record companies were slow to react to the impact of digitization and failed to secure copyrights . now , according to emi 's faxon , international media giants are combining and catching up fast . " we have cooperated with germany 's gema and britain 's alliance -lrb- artist copyright organizations -rrb- to create a pan-european copyright protection organization which simplifies licensing , " he said . taking on illegal downloading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : licensing partnerships can help tackle music piracy as well as securing cross-border licensing agreements for digital media , emi is involved in promoting download services which aim to compete with illegal sites .
its own spiral frog service was set up to provide consumers with higher quality downloads than they could get from file sharing and peer-to-peer platforms . users can download the music for free but the artists do not lose out ; reaping financial benefits from the advertising revenue . the artists themselves still see a silver lining to being illegally downloaded or having their work bootlegged and shown / played on the internet .
will.i.am , singer with the black eyed peas , said that even if someone records part of his band 's show on a mobile phone and then posts it on open broadcasting platform youtube , therefore potentially damaging sales of the show 's dvd release , it 's still not all bad news . a silver lining to music piracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no such thing as bad publicity ...
" our name is out there , " the rapper , producer and composer said .
" it 's on everyone 's lips who saw that clip and that is useful when you 're touring .
if people see you on youtube and like what they see , then they will want to come and see you live . " what does make the black eyed peas nervous is how the music industry reacts to the demise of the cd . " the cd has no market anymore , " will.i.am said .
" the kids today who have all these new toys do n't care about this format that their brother was into years ago .

one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .
" the internet is like an airline , " he said .
" it offers an alternative ; just like television and the radio , the internet is now just another option , another airline you can take .
they will continue to operate in unity and never destroy each other . " cross-border licensing problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists can make huge bounds through myspace even the big media companies seem to hold no fear of the future .
emi , the biggest music publisher in the world , also has high hopes for promotional platforms and the benefits they can bring their artists . " we think that social networks and the progressive expansion of promotion are very promising , " said emi president roger faxon .
" if we create the right licensing system for this , the music market will continue to blossom .
if not , the pessimists will be proved right and piracy will blossom , but we will not allow this . " and there lies the biggest of the problems facing the music industry in such a self-empowered world : each region has its own licensing systems .
in europe , the record companies were slow to react to the impact of digitization and failed to secure copyrights . now , according to emi 's faxon , international media giants are combining and catching up fast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 28.01.2007 germany 's pursuit of holocaust denial resolution hits skids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany believes that denying the deaths of over six million jews should be a crime germany 's hope of using its eu presidency to persuade all 27 member states to make holocaust denial a crime has received a setback in italy and is expected to run into more resistance . berlin on friday won moral support from the united nations which adopted a resolution urging members to " reject any denial of the holocaust as a historical event " . diplomats said the move was aimed at iran , whose president mahmoud ahmadinejad dismisses the murder of six million jews by the nazis and their collaborators in world war ii as a lie . hours before the un resolution was passed , the italian government published a draft law which proposes penalties of up to three years in jail for inciting racial hatred , but stops short of making holocaust denial a crime . some 200 historians had voiced their objection , arguing that it would infringe on free speech , and justice minister clemente mastella failed to win support for a more explicit bill . germany had looked to rome for support for its drive for a common eu law , saying the support of the new italian government would leave " the road clear " for standardization . a similar attempt by luxembourg in 2005 was blocked by britain , denmark and notably italy , where silvio berlusconi 's centre-right coalition was still in power . germany has a moral imperative , says justice minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said germany would still pursue a ban german justice minister brigitte zypries this month said germany had a moral imperative to try again for an eu-wide ban because of the third reich 's responsibility for the holocaust . in europe , only austria , belgium , france , germany , poland , romania and spain have laws that specifically target revisionism , leaving berlin to convince 20 others to come on board by july . zypries ' arguments for a common law are borrowed from luxembourg 's failed bid which was perceived as a way of preventing anti-semitism ever again sweeping europe . she told eu counterparts at a meeting in dresden that criminalizing holocaust denial would help to stem a rising tide of far-right extremism , which is particularly visible in eastern germany . " the steep increase in the activities of right-wing extremists and in violent crimes committed by them is worrying us .
we should at last put in place consistent measures to fight the far-right . " she proposed that all european union countries also criminalize the use of nazi insignia . swastika ban plan faces opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hindu symbol was perverted by the third reich this has sparked an angry counter-campaign by hindu groups who say the swastika had been part of their religious symbols for nearly 5,000 years before the nazis appropriated it . germany made holocaust denial a crime in 1985 .
it wants the rest of europe to penalize it by one to three years in prison . beate rudolf , an expert on european law at berlin 's free university , believes the initiative is doomed . " i do not think they will be able to rally all member states behind their proposal .
traditionally , there is too big a difference between members ' practice on this specific issue , " she told afp . rudolf said germany was seeking to make article 13 of the european community treaty more legally binding to fight discrimination . " this is a difficult argument because they are saying that to promote one basic human right you need to limit freedom of speech , which is another basic human right . " she predicted the german proposal would again be opposed by britain , as well as states who " do not think that the power of the eu extends far beyond the economic arena " . prosecution of deniers challenged by intellectuals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving was jailed in austria under its denial laws the persecution of holocaust deniers has been questioned by intellectuals across europe and austria 's jailing of british revisionist historian david irving was strongly criticized . irving was handed a three-year sentence for claiming that adolf hitler had tried to help the jews , but was freed in december after serving 13 months . berlin 's bid could also become bogged down in an argument with the baltic states which want the eu to make it a crime to deny the abuses of the stalinist regime in the soviet union . in germany the prevailing view is that not even the horrors of stalinism could be equated with the holocaust . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german holocaust denial case proceeds as eu moves on a ban as one of the most famous holocaust deniers goes on trial in germany , the eu takes steps to criminalize denying the shoah .

" i have to admit that al gore was the tipping point , " klaus kleinfeld , chief executive of german electronics group siemens , admitted in one debate , referring to the 2006 film about global warming made by the former us presidential candidate . global trade talks got a lift on saturday when leading ministers meeting on the sidelines of the event agreed on the principle of re-starting stalled world trade organization talks . hopes for new round of doha trade talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's lamy saw hope in the davos trade talks the doha round of wto talks was suspended last july by wto director general pascal lamy after the european union , the united states and developing countries became deadlock . " my sense of the -lrb- trade -rrb- meeting was a positive one , " said brazilian foreign minister celso amorim afterwards .
" i left with a higher feeling of optimism . " the doha round was launched by wto members in the qatari capital doha in 2001 with the aim of reducing trade barriers for the benefit of poor countries . in addition to several debates on iraq and the middle east , the israeli-palestinian conflict took centre stage on thursday evening when palestinian president mahmoud abbas shared a stage with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni and deputy prime minister shimon peres . both sides expressed a desire for peace based on the idea of an independent palestinian state , an expression of goodwill at a time when international action to solve the conflict is gathering momentum . middle east negotiations preparing to restart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and abbas talked peace on the sidelines " we are ready , as of now , to start serious negotiations with our israeli neighbors , " abbas told the audience . us secretary of state condoleezza rice is due to meet with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and abbas in the next few weeks and she will also host a meeting of the middle east peace quartet on friday . the quartet includes the united states , the european union , russia and un secretary general ban ki-moon . the gathering , set in the glitzy davos ski resort in the swiss alps , this year featured appearances from the leaders of brazil , britain , germany , mexico , the philippines and south africa , who mingled with the leading names in business . above all , the event serves as a useful gauge of the preoccupations of policymakers and the world 's business elite , with the shift of economic and political influence to asia giants india and china another dominant theme in 2007 . development and trade focus on asia , india and africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair , bono and liberian president sirleaf set out a vision for africa development issues and poverty in africa were addressed by pop star and campaigner bono and british prime minister tony blair , while bill gates revealed how his global immunization program gavi had vaccinated 138 million children since 2000 . bono was a rare exception as a celebrity in davos this year after the organizer of the event , klaus schwab , decided to reduce the number of showbiz stars in attendance . hollywood a-listers had threatened to overshadow the event in recent history and outshine the corporate clientele who pay from 35,000 swiss francs -lrb- 22,000 euros , 28,000 dollars -rrb- to attend . this year also saw a move to embrace the online community , featuring a discussion of second life , the computer-based virtual world , and an internet site to aggregate blogs written about the event . davos was not all serious discussion however , with attendees invited to join seminars on topics such as " why do brains sleep ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 28.01.2007 music industry eyes digital age with growing optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers and sellers mingle with the movers and shakers at midem 2007 in cannes at the 2007 midem music fair in cannes , artists and executives from the music and media industries come to discuss and promote the latest fads and trends .
one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .
" the internet is like an airline , " he said .
" it offers an alternative ; just like television and the radio , the internet is now just another option , another airline you can take .
they will continue to operate in unity and never destroy each other . " cross-border licensing problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists can make huge bounds through myspace even the big media companies seem to hold no fear of the future .
emi , the biggest music publisher in the world , also has high hopes for promotional platforms and the benefits they can bring their artists . " we think that social networks and the progressive expansion of promotion are very promising , " said emi president roger faxon .
" if we create the right licensing system for this , the music market will continue to blossom .
if not , the pessimists will be proved right and piracy will blossom , but we will not allow this . " and there lies the biggest of the problems facing the music industry in such a self-empowered world : each region has its own licensing systems .
in europe , the record companies were slow to react to the impact of digitization and failed to secure copyrights . now , according to emi 's faxon , international media giants are combining and catching up fast . " we have cooperated with germany 's gema and britain 's alliance -lrb- artist copyright organizations -rrb- to create a pan-european copyright protection organization which simplifies licensing , " he said . taking on illegal downloading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : licensing partnerships can help tackle music piracy as well as securing cross-border licensing agreements for digital media , emi is involved in promoting download services which aim to compete with illegal sites .
its own spiral frog service was set up to provide consumers with higher quality downloads than they could get from file sharing and peer-to-peer platforms . users can download the music for free but the artists do not lose out ; reaping financial benefits from the advertising revenue . the artists themselves still see a silver lining to being illegally downloaded or having their work bootlegged and shown / played on the internet .
will.i.am , singer with the black eyed peas , said that even if someone records part of his band 's show on a mobile phone and then posts it on open broadcasting platform youtube , therefore potentially damaging sales of the show 's dvd release , it 's still not all bad news . a silver lining to music piracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no such thing as bad publicity ...
" our name is out there , " the rapper , producer and composer said .
" it 's on everyone 's lips who saw that clip and that is useful when you 're touring .
if people see you on youtube and like what they see , then they will want to come and see you live . " what does make the black eyed peas nervous is how the music industry reacts to the demise of the cd . " the cd has no market anymore , " will.i.am said .
" the kids today who have all these new toys do n't care about this format that their brother was into years ago .
a product in a plastic cover means nothing these days . " that 's not to say that the companies who produce the product are likely to go the same way .
there still needs to be a record company to groom and promote the next michael jackson or marvin gaye .

" there should not be a green light for all biofuels , " said imke lübbeke , an energy expert for the german world wildlife fund , adding that some renewable sources of energy are not necessarily good for the environment . but while the wwf and other environmental organizations said that it is irresponsible to cut down large swaths of carbon dioxide absorbing rainforest to make way for renewable crops that could potentially be the power sources of the future , there is still room for europe expand its fields of biofuel producing plants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still has space for more fields of renewable energy producing plants " a million hectares of farmland , that 's 10 percent of cultivable land in germany , are fallow and this standstill is even supported by the government , " said jürgen zeddies , an agricultural economist at the university of hohenheim , adding that some of these fields could be used to grown renewable material for fuels . danger for local flora other environmental protection groups , however , warn that using all the fields for fuel material could lead to the extinction of a number of plant types in germany as soil properties change due to the new crops . that will make it crucial to find environmentally friendly ways of creating biofuel , lübbeke said . " we have to be careful that biofuel is made in an environmentally friendly way , " she said .
" it does n't make any sense to sacrifice important protected areas or soil and water protection zones for rapeseed and sugar beets for biofuels . " biomass is a solution that lübbeke and zeddies agreed could be an intelligent way to create power and heat in an environmentally friendly way , especially as most of these types of energy comes from coal power plants . replacing the worst polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is already mixed into nearly all germany 's diesel pumps " the question is always what types of energy you are using bioenergy to replace , " said nils rettenmaier of heidelberg 's institute for energy and environmental research .
" and it makes sense to replace the ones that are the most carbon heavy . " rettenmaier added that he feels biofuels are often not used as intelligently as they could be and called on the auto industry not to just make engines that use biofuels but to make more efficient engines in general . " the automobile industry uses biofuels for its lobbying work , " he said .
" it tries to turn attention from its task of building efficient vehicles . " there may be a ray of light coming for rettenmaier and other environmental protection groups from the european union next week .

one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .
" the internet is like an airline , " he said .
" it offers an alternative ; just like television and the radio , the internet is now just another option , another airline you can take .
they will continue to operate in unity and never destroy each other . " cross-border licensing problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists can make huge bounds through myspace even the big media companies seem to hold no fear of the future .
emi , the biggest music publisher in the world , also has high hopes for promotional platforms and the benefits they can bring their artists . " we think that social networks and the progressive expansion of promotion are very promising , " said emi president roger faxon .
" if we create the right licensing system for this , the music market will continue to blossom .
if not , the pessimists will be proved right and piracy will blossom , but we will not allow this . " and there lies the biggest of the problems facing the music industry in such a self-empowered world : each region has its own licensing systems .
in europe , the record companies were slow to react to the impact of digitization and failed to secure copyrights . now , according to emi 's faxon , international media giants are combining and catching up fast . " we have cooperated with germany 's gema and britain 's alliance -lrb- artist copyright organizations -rrb- to create a pan-european copyright protection organization which simplifies licensing , " he said . taking on illegal downloading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : licensing partnerships can help tackle music piracy as well as securing cross-border licensing agreements for digital media , emi is involved in promoting download services which aim to compete with illegal sites .
its own spiral frog service was set up to provide consumers with higher quality downloads than they could get from file sharing and peer-to-peer platforms . users can download the music for free but the artists do not lose out ; reaping financial benefits from the advertising revenue . the artists themselves still see a silver lining to being illegally downloaded or having their work bootlegged and shown / played on the internet .
will.i.am , singer with the black eyed peas , said that even if someone records part of his band 's show on a mobile phone and then posts it on open broadcasting platform youtube , therefore potentially damaging sales of the show 's dvd release , it 's still not all bad news . a silver lining to music piracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no such thing as bad publicity ...
" our name is out there , " the rapper , producer and composer said .
" it 's on everyone 's lips who saw that clip and that is useful when you 're touring .
if people see you on youtube and like what they see , then they will want to come and see you live . " what does make the black eyed peas nervous is how the music industry reacts to the demise of the cd . " the cd has no market anymore , " will.i.am said .
" the kids today who have all these new toys do n't care about this format that their brother was into years ago .
a product in a plastic cover means nothing these days . " that 's not to say that the companies who produce the product are likely to go the same way .
there still needs to be a record company to groom and promote the next michael jackson or marvin gaye .

one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 28.01.2007 germany 's pursuit of holocaust denial resolution hits skids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany believes that denying the deaths of over six million jews should be a crime germany 's hope of using its eu presidency to persuade all 27 member states to make holocaust denial a crime has received a setback in italy and is expected to run into more resistance . berlin on friday won moral support from the united nations which adopted a resolution urging members to " reject any denial of the holocaust as a historical event " . diplomats said the move was aimed at iran , whose president mahmoud ahmadinejad dismisses the murder of six million jews by the nazis and their collaborators in world war ii as a lie . hours before the un resolution was passed , the italian government published a draft law which proposes penalties of up to three years in jail for inciting racial hatred , but stops short of making holocaust denial a crime . some 200 historians had voiced their objection , arguing that it would infringe on free speech , and justice minister clemente mastella failed to win support for a more explicit bill . germany had looked to rome for support for its drive for a common eu law , saying the support of the new italian government would leave " the road clear " for standardization . a similar attempt by luxembourg in 2005 was blocked by britain , denmark and notably italy , where silvio berlusconi 's centre-right coalition was still in power . germany has a moral imperative , says justice minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said germany would still pursue a ban german justice minister brigitte zypries this month said germany had a moral imperative to try again for an eu-wide ban because of the third reich 's responsibility for the holocaust . in europe , only austria , belgium , france , germany , poland , romania and spain have laws that specifically target revisionism , leaving berlin to convince 20 others to come on board by july . zypries ' arguments for a common law are borrowed from luxembourg 's failed bid which was perceived as a way of preventing anti-semitism ever again sweeping europe . she told eu counterparts at a meeting in dresden that criminalizing holocaust denial would help to stem a rising tide of far-right extremism , which is particularly visible in eastern germany . " the steep increase in the activities of right-wing extremists and in violent crimes committed by them is worrying us .
we should at last put in place consistent measures to fight the far-right . " she proposed that all european union countries also criminalize the use of nazi insignia . swastika ban plan faces opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hindu symbol was perverted by the third reich this has sparked an angry counter-campaign by hindu groups who say the swastika had been part of their religious symbols for nearly 5,000 years before the nazis appropriated it . germany made holocaust denial a crime in 1985 .
it wants the rest of europe to penalize it by one to three years in prison . beate rudolf , an expert on european law at berlin 's free university , believes the initiative is doomed . " i do not think they will be able to rally all member states behind their proposal .
traditionally , there is too big a difference between members ' practice on this specific issue , " she told afp . rudolf said germany was seeking to make article 13 of the european community treaty more legally binding to fight discrimination . " this is a difficult argument because they are saying that to promote one basic human right you need to limit freedom of speech , which is another basic human right . " she predicted the german proposal would again be opposed by britain , as well as states who " do not think that the power of the eu extends far beyond the economic arena " . prosecution of deniers challenged by intellectuals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving was jailed in austria under its denial laws the persecution of holocaust deniers has been questioned by intellectuals across europe and austria 's jailing of british revisionist historian david irving was strongly criticized . irving was handed a three-year sentence for claiming that adolf hitler had tried to help the jews , but was freed in december after serving 13 months . berlin 's bid could also become bogged down in an argument with the baltic states which want the eu to make it a crime to deny the abuses of the stalinist regime in the soviet union . in germany the prevailing view is that not even the horrors of stalinism could be equated with the holocaust . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german holocaust denial case proceeds as eu moves on a ban as one of the most famous holocaust deniers goes on trial in germany , the eu takes steps to criminalize denying the shoah .
-lrb- 26.01.2007 -rrb- should the eu make holocaust denial a crime ?

" the steep increase in the activities of right-wing extremists and in violent crimes committed by them is worrying us .
we should at last put in place consistent measures to fight the far-right . " she proposed that all european union countries also criminalize the use of nazi insignia . swastika ban plan faces opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hindu symbol was perverted by the third reich this has sparked an angry counter-campaign by hindu groups who say the swastika had been part of their religious symbols for nearly 5,000 years before the nazis appropriated it . germany made holocaust denial a crime in 1985 .
it wants the rest of europe to penalize it by one to three years in prison . beate rudolf , an expert on european law at berlin 's free university , believes the initiative is doomed . " i do not think they will be able to rally all member states behind their proposal .
traditionally , there is too big a difference between members ' practice on this specific issue , " she told afp . rudolf said germany was seeking to make article 13 of the european community treaty more legally binding to fight discrimination . " this is a difficult argument because they are saying that to promote one basic human right you need to limit freedom of speech , which is another basic human right . " she predicted the german proposal would again be opposed by britain , as well as states who " do not think that the power of the eu extends far beyond the economic arena " . prosecution of deniers challenged by intellectuals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving was jailed in austria under its denial laws the persecution of holocaust deniers has been questioned by intellectuals across europe and austria 's jailing of british revisionist historian david irving was strongly criticized . irving was handed a three-year sentence for claiming that adolf hitler had tried to help the jews , but was freed in december after serving 13 months . berlin 's bid could also become bogged down in an argument with the baltic states which want the eu to make it a crime to deny the abuses of the stalinist regime in the soviet union . in germany the prevailing view is that not even the horrors of stalinism could be equated with the holocaust . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german holocaust denial case proceeds as eu moves on a ban as one of the most famous holocaust deniers goes on trial in germany , the eu takes steps to criminalize denying the shoah .

" i have to admit that al gore was the tipping point , " klaus kleinfeld , chief executive of german electronics group siemens , admitted in one debate , referring to the 2006 film about global warming made by the former us presidential candidate . global trade talks got a lift on saturday when leading ministers meeting on the sidelines of the event agreed on the principle of re-starting stalled world trade organization talks . hopes for new round of doha trade talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's lamy saw hope in the davos trade talks the doha round of wto talks was suspended last july by wto director general pascal lamy after the european union , the united states and developing countries became deadlock .

" i left with a higher feeling of optimism . " the doha round was launched by wto members in the qatari capital doha in 2001 with the aim of reducing trade barriers for the benefit of poor countries . in addition to several debates on iraq and the middle east , the israeli-palestinian conflict took centre stage on thursday evening when palestinian president mahmoud abbas shared a stage with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni and deputy prime minister shimon peres . both sides expressed a desire for peace based on the idea of an independent palestinian state , an expression of goodwill at a time when international action to solve the conflict is gathering momentum . middle east negotiations preparing to restart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and abbas talked peace on the sidelines " we are ready , as of now , to start serious negotiations with our israeli neighbors , " abbas told the audience . us secretary of state condoleezza rice is due to meet with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and abbas in the next few weeks and she will also host a meeting of the middle east peace quartet on friday . the quartet includes the united states , the european union , russia and un secretary general ban ki-moon . the gathering , set in the glitzy davos ski resort in the swiss alps , this year featured appearances from the leaders of brazil , britain , germany , mexico , the philippines and south africa , who mingled with the leading names in business . above all , the event serves as a useful gauge of the preoccupations of policymakers and the world 's business elite , with the shift of economic and political influence to asia giants india and china another dominant theme in 2007 . development and trade focus on asia , india and africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair , bono and liberian president sirleaf set out a vision for africa development issues and poverty in africa were addressed by pop star and campaigner bono and british prime minister tony blair , while bill gates revealed how his global immunization program gavi had vaccinated 138 million children since 2000 . bono was a rare exception as a celebrity in davos this year after the organizer of the event , klaus schwab , decided to reduce the number of showbiz stars in attendance . hollywood a-listers had threatened to overshadow the event in recent history and outshine the corporate clientele who pay from 35,000 swiss francs -lrb- 22,000 euros , 28,000 dollars -rrb- to attend . this year also saw a move to embrace the online community , featuring a discussion of second life , the computer-based virtual world , and an internet site to aggregate blogs written about the event . davos was not all serious discussion however , with attendees invited to join seminars on topics such as " why do brains sleep ? " and " a blueprint for human settlement of the solar system " . another seminar promised to examine the issue of self-esteem - hardly a scarce commodity in the rarefied world of davos . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers back resumption of stalled doha trade talks in davos ministers from 24 key trading nations on saturday backed a " quick resumption " of the frozen doha round of global trade talks after a meeting in davos , the swiss economics ministry said .

" every time i arrive back from africa , i am sad and very angry to see the pictures that the mass media show from the african continent , " mankell said in berlin on sunday .
" we hear all about how africa is dying but nothing about how people there live . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mankell has written several books about life in africa the western world focuses on the injustices in africa and does much to support the continent , he said , but added that support for the continent has dropped off since the 1990s and that the developed world could eliminate illiteracy in africa with the money it spends on dog and cat food . west responsible for african corruption now 58 , mankell is best known for his crime series featuring police inspector kurt wallander , but he has also written of his love affair with africa in " chronicler of the wind " and " playing with fire . " mankell also touched on the topic of corruption in africa , which he acknowledged to be a problem , but not just an african one . " i 've lived in africa long enough to realize that we brought much of the corruption that is there , " he said . " when people talk about corruption i say ' follow the money , " ' mankell added .
" follow the money and you will end up at siemens .
follow the money and you will end up at volvo .
follow the money and you will end up at any of the big western corporations . " a new point of view bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mankell has been in love with africa since first visiting the continent when he was 20 he also accused europe of focusing on the negatives in africa while at the same time exploiting its wealth - from natural resources to athletes . " now we are not just taking soccer players , we are taking africa 's intellectual potential , " mankell said .
" there are more african doctors working on the european continent than the african .
why is that ?
because of the money , of course . " he said that having seen poverty in africa has made him able to look at the world from a new angle , which has affected his european perspective . while in mozambique in the 1980s during the country 's civil war , he came upon a man dressed in rags who had painted shoes on his bare feet using dirt . " he taught me something very important , that no matter how low you have sunk , it is possible to defend your own dignity , " mankell said . silke bartlick -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany joins forces with britain to fight poverty in africa germany and britain have announced that they are to join forces to help africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 28.01.2007 music industry eyes digital age with growing optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers and sellers mingle with the movers and shakers at midem 2007 in cannes at the 2007 midem music fair in cannes , artists and executives from the music and media industries come to discuss and promote the latest fads and trends .
one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .
" the internet is like an airline , " he said .
" it offers an alternative ; just like television and the radio , the internet is now just another option , another airline you can take .
they will continue to operate in unity and never destroy each other . " cross-border licensing problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists can make huge bounds through myspace even the big media companies seem to hold no fear of the future .
emi , the biggest music publisher in the world , also has high hopes for promotional platforms and the benefits they can bring their artists . " we think that social networks and the progressive expansion of promotion are very promising , " said emi president roger faxon .
" if we create the right licensing system for this , the music market will continue to blossom .
if not , the pessimists will be proved right and piracy will blossom , but we will not allow this . " and there lies the biggest of the problems facing the music industry in such a self-empowered world : each region has its own licensing systems .
in europe , the record companies were slow to react to the impact of digitization and failed to secure copyrights . now , according to emi 's faxon , international media giants are combining and catching up fast . " we have cooperated with germany 's gema and britain 's alliance -lrb- artist copyright organizations -rrb- to create a pan-european copyright protection organization which simplifies licensing , " he said . taking on illegal downloading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : licensing partnerships can help tackle music piracy as well as securing cross-border licensing agreements for digital media , emi is involved in promoting download services which aim to compete with illegal sites .
its own spiral frog service was set up to provide consumers with higher quality downloads than they could get from file sharing and peer-to-peer platforms . users can download the music for free but the artists do not lose out ; reaping financial benefits from the advertising revenue . the artists themselves still see a silver lining to being illegally downloaded or having their work bootlegged and shown / played on the internet .
will.i.am , singer with the black eyed peas , said that even if someone records part of his band 's show on a mobile phone and then posts it on open broadcasting platform youtube , therefore potentially damaging sales of the show 's dvd release , it 's still not all bad news . a silver lining to music piracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no such thing as bad publicity ...
" our name is out there , " the rapper , producer and composer said .
" it 's on everyone 's lips who saw that clip and that is useful when you 're touring .
if people see you on youtube and like what they see , then they will want to come and see you live . " what does make the black eyed peas nervous is how the music industry reacts to the demise of the cd . " the cd has no market anymore , " will.i.am said .
" the kids today who have all these new toys do n't care about this format that their brother was into years ago .
a product in a plastic cover means nothing these days . " that 's not to say that the companies who produce the product are likely to go the same way .
there still needs to be a record company to groom and promote the next michael jackson or marvin gaye .

" every time i arrive back from africa , i am sad and very angry to see the pictures that the mass media show from the african continent , " mankell said in berlin on sunday .
" we hear all about how africa is dying but nothing about how people there live . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mankell has written several books about life in africa the western world focuses on the injustices in africa and does much to support the continent , he said , but added that support for the continent has dropped off since the 1990s and that the developed world could eliminate illiteracy in africa with the money it spends on dog and cat food . west responsible for african corruption now 58 , mankell is best known for his crime series featuring police inspector kurt wallander , but he has also written of his love affair with africa in " chronicler of the wind " and " playing with fire . " mankell also touched on the topic of corruption in africa , which he acknowledged to be a problem , but not just an african one . " i 've lived in africa long enough to realize that we brought much of the corruption that is there , " he said . " when people talk about corruption i say ' follow the money , " ' mankell added .
" follow the money and you will end up at siemens .
follow the money and you will end up at volvo .
follow the money and you will end up at any of the big western corporations . " a new point of view bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mankell has been in love with africa since first visiting the continent when he was 20 he also accused europe of focusing on the negatives in africa while at the same time exploiting its wealth - from natural resources to athletes . " now we are not just taking soccer players , we are taking africa 's intellectual potential , " mankell said .
" there are more african doctors working on the european continent than the african .
why is that ?
because of the money , of course . " he said that having seen poverty in africa has made him able to look at the world from a new angle , which has affected his european perspective . while in mozambique in the 1980s during the country 's civil war , he came upon a man dressed in rags who had painted shoes on his bare feet using dirt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 28.01.2007 music industry eyes digital age with growing optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers and sellers mingle with the movers and shakers at midem 2007 in cannes at the 2007 midem music fair in cannes , artists and executives from the music and media industries come to discuss and promote the latest fads and trends .
one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .
" the internet is like an airline , " he said .
" it offers an alternative ; just like television and the radio , the internet is now just another option , another airline you can take .
they will continue to operate in unity and never destroy each other . " cross-border licensing problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists can make huge bounds through myspace even the big media companies seem to hold no fear of the future .
emi , the biggest music publisher in the world , also has high hopes for promotional platforms and the benefits they can bring their artists . " we think that social networks and the progressive expansion of promotion are very promising , " said emi president roger faxon .
" if we create the right licensing system for this , the music market will continue to blossom .
if not , the pessimists will be proved right and piracy will blossom , but we will not allow this . " and there lies the biggest of the problems facing the music industry in such a self-empowered world : each region has its own licensing systems .
in europe , the record companies were slow to react to the impact of digitization and failed to secure copyrights . now , according to emi 's faxon , international media giants are combining and catching up fast . " we have cooperated with germany 's gema and britain 's alliance -lrb- artist copyright organizations -rrb- to create a pan-european copyright protection organization which simplifies licensing , " he said . taking on illegal downloading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : licensing partnerships can help tackle music piracy as well as securing cross-border licensing agreements for digital media , emi is involved in promoting download services which aim to compete with illegal sites .
its own spiral frog service was set up to provide consumers with higher quality downloads than they could get from file sharing and peer-to-peer platforms . users can download the music for free but the artists do not lose out ; reaping financial benefits from the advertising revenue . the artists themselves still see a silver lining to being illegally downloaded or having their work bootlegged and shown / played on the internet .
will.i.am , singer with the black eyed peas , said that even if someone records part of his band 's show on a mobile phone and then posts it on open broadcasting platform youtube , therefore potentially damaging sales of the show 's dvd release , it 's still not all bad news . a silver lining to music piracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no such thing as bad publicity ...
" our name is out there , " the rapper , producer and composer said .
" it 's on everyone 's lips who saw that clip and that is useful when you 're touring .
if people see you on youtube and like what they see , then they will want to come and see you live . " what does make the black eyed peas nervous is how the music industry reacts to the demise of the cd . " the cd has no market anymore , " will.i.am said .
" the kids today who have all these new toys do n't care about this format that their brother was into years ago .
a product in a plastic cover means nothing these days . " that 's not to say that the companies who produce the product are likely to go the same way .
there still needs to be a record company to groom and promote the next michael jackson or marvin gaye .

" every time i arrive back from africa , i am sad and very angry to see the pictures that the mass media show from the african continent , " mankell said in berlin on sunday .
" we hear all about how africa is dying but nothing about how people there live . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mankell has written several books about life in africa the western world focuses on the injustices in africa and does much to support the continent , he said , but added that support for the continent has dropped off since the 1990s and that the developed world could eliminate illiteracy in africa with the money it spends on dog and cat food . west responsible for african corruption now 58 , mankell is best known for his crime series featuring police inspector kurt wallander , but he has also written of his love affair with africa in " chronicler of the wind " and " playing with fire . " mankell also touched on the topic of corruption in africa , which he acknowledged to be a problem , but not just an african one . " i 've lived in africa long enough to realize that we brought much of the corruption that is there , " he said . " when people talk about corruption i say ' follow the money , " ' mankell added .
" follow the money and you will end up at siemens .
follow the money and you will end up at volvo .
follow the money and you will end up at any of the big western corporations . " a new point of view bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mankell has been in love with africa since first visiting the continent when he was 20 he also accused europe of focusing on the negatives in africa while at the same time exploiting its wealth - from natural resources to athletes . " now we are not just taking soccer players , we are taking africa 's intellectual potential , " mankell said .
" there are more african doctors working on the european continent than the african .
why is that ?
because of the money , of course . " he said that having seen poverty in africa has made him able to look at the world from a new angle , which has affected his european perspective . while in mozambique in the 1980s during the country 's civil war , he came upon a man dressed in rags who had painted shoes on his bare feet using dirt . " he taught me something very important , that no matter how low you have sunk , it is possible to defend your own dignity , " mankell said . silke bartlick -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany joins forces with britain to fight poverty in africa germany and britain have announced that they are to join forces to help africa .

" i have to admit that al gore was the tipping point , " klaus kleinfeld , chief executive of german electronics group siemens , admitted in one debate , referring to the 2006 film about global warming made by the former us presidential candidate . global trade talks got a lift on saturday when leading ministers meeting on the sidelines of the event agreed on the principle of re-starting stalled world trade organization talks . hopes for new round of doha trade talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's lamy saw hope in the davos trade talks the doha round of wto talks was suspended last july by wto director general pascal lamy after the european union , the united states and developing countries became deadlock .

but some groups in germany say not all biofuels are created equal . " there should not be a green light for all biofuels , " said imke lübbeke , an energy expert for the german world wildlife fund , adding that some renewable sources of energy are not necessarily good for the environment . but while the wwf and other environmental organizations said that it is irresponsible to cut down large swaths of carbon dioxide absorbing rainforest to make way for renewable crops that could potentially be the power sources of the future , there is still room for europe expand its fields of biofuel producing plants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still has space for more fields of renewable energy producing plants " a million hectares of farmland , that 's 10 percent of cultivable land in germany , are fallow and this standstill is even supported by the government , " said jürgen zeddies , an agricultural economist at the university of hohenheim , adding that some of these fields could be used to grown renewable material for fuels . danger for local flora other environmental protection groups , however , warn that using all the fields for fuel material could lead to the extinction of a number of plant types in germany as soil properties change due to the new crops . that will make it crucial to find environmentally friendly ways of creating biofuel , lübbeke said . " we have to be careful that biofuel is made in an environmentally friendly way , " she said .
" it does n't make any sense to sacrifice important protected areas or soil and water protection zones for rapeseed and sugar beets for biofuels . " biomass is a solution that lübbeke and zeddies agreed could be an intelligent way to create power and heat in an environmentally friendly way , especially as most of these types of energy comes from coal power plants . replacing the worst polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is already mixed into nearly all germany 's diesel pumps " the question is always what types of energy you are using bioenergy to replace , " said nils rettenmaier of heidelberg 's institute for energy and environmental research .
" and it makes sense to replace the ones that are the most carbon heavy . " rettenmaier added that he feels biofuels are often not used as intelligently as they could be and called on the auto industry not to just make engines that use biofuels but to make more efficient engines in general . " the automobile industry uses biofuels for its lobbying work , " he said .
" it tries to turn attention from its task of building efficient vehicles . " there may be a ray of light coming for rettenmaier and other environmental protection groups from the european union next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 28.01.2007 music industry eyes digital age with growing optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers and sellers mingle with the movers and shakers at midem 2007 in cannes at the 2007 midem music fair in cannes , artists and executives from the music and media industries come to discuss and promote the latest fads and trends .
one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .
" the internet is like an airline , " he said .
" it offers an alternative ; just like television and the radio , the internet is now just another option , another airline you can take .
they will continue to operate in unity and never destroy each other . " cross-border licensing problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists can make huge bounds through myspace even the big media companies seem to hold no fear of the future .
emi , the biggest music publisher in the world , also has high hopes for promotional platforms and the benefits they can bring their artists . " we think that social networks and the progressive expansion of promotion are very promising , " said emi president roger faxon .
" if we create the right licensing system for this , the music market will continue to blossom .
if not , the pessimists will be proved right and piracy will blossom , but we will not allow this . " and there lies the biggest of the problems facing the music industry in such a self-empowered world : each region has its own licensing systems .
in europe , the record companies were slow to react to the impact of digitization and failed to secure copyrights . now , according to emi 's faxon , international media giants are combining and catching up fast . " we have cooperated with germany 's gema and britain 's alliance -lrb- artist copyright organizations -rrb- to create a pan-european copyright protection organization which simplifies licensing , " he said . taking on illegal downloading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : licensing partnerships can help tackle music piracy as well as securing cross-border licensing agreements for digital media , emi is involved in promoting download services which aim to compete with illegal sites .
its own spiral frog service was set up to provide consumers with higher quality downloads than they could get from file sharing and peer-to-peer platforms . users can download the music for free but the artists do not lose out ; reaping financial benefits from the advertising revenue . the artists themselves still see a silver lining to being illegally downloaded or having their work bootlegged and shown / played on the internet .
will.i.am , singer with the black eyed peas , said that even if someone records part of his band 's show on a mobile phone and then posts it on open broadcasting platform youtube , therefore potentially damaging sales of the show 's dvd release , it 's still not all bad news . a silver lining to music piracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no such thing as bad publicity ...
" our name is out there , " the rapper , producer and composer said .
" it 's on everyone 's lips who saw that clip and that is useful when you 're touring .

one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .

but some groups in germany say not all biofuels are created equal . " there should not be a green light for all biofuels , " said imke lübbeke , an energy expert for the german world wildlife fund , adding that some renewable sources of energy are not necessarily good for the environment . but while the wwf and other environmental organizations said that it is irresponsible to cut down large swaths of carbon dioxide absorbing rainforest to make way for renewable crops that could potentially be the power sources of the future , there is still room for europe expand its fields of biofuel producing plants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still has space for more fields of renewable energy producing plants " a million hectares of farmland , that 's 10 percent of cultivable land in germany , are fallow and this standstill is even supported by the government , " said jürgen zeddies , an agricultural economist at the university of hohenheim , adding that some of these fields could be used to grown renewable material for fuels . danger for local flora other environmental protection groups , however , warn that using all the fields for fuel material could lead to the extinction of a number of plant types in germany as soil properties change due to the new crops . that will make it crucial to find environmentally friendly ways of creating biofuel , lübbeke said . " we have to be careful that biofuel is made in an environmentally friendly way , " she said .
" it does n't make any sense to sacrifice important protected areas or soil and water protection zones for rapeseed and sugar beets for biofuels . " biomass is a solution that lübbeke and zeddies agreed could be an intelligent way to create power and heat in an environmentally friendly way , especially as most of these types of energy comes from coal power plants . replacing the worst polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is already mixed into nearly all germany 's diesel pumps " the question is always what types of energy you are using bioenergy to replace , " said nils rettenmaier of heidelberg 's institute for energy and environmental research .
" and it makes sense to replace the ones that are the most carbon heavy . " rettenmaier added that he feels biofuels are often not used as intelligently as they could be and called on the auto industry not to just make engines that use biofuels but to make more efficient engines in general . " the automobile industry uses biofuels for its lobbying work , " he said .
" it tries to turn attention from its task of building efficient vehicles . " there may be a ray of light coming for rettenmaier and other environmental protection groups from the european union next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 28.01.2007 music industry eyes digital age with growing optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers and sellers mingle with the movers and shakers at midem 2007 in cannes at the 2007 midem music fair in cannes , artists and executives from the music and media industries come to discuss and promote the latest fads and trends .
one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .
" the internet is like an airline , " he said .
" it offers an alternative ; just like television and the radio , the internet is now just another option , another airline you can take .
they will continue to operate in unity and never destroy each other . " cross-border licensing problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists can make huge bounds through myspace even the big media companies seem to hold no fear of the future .
emi , the biggest music publisher in the world , also has high hopes for promotional platforms and the benefits they can bring their artists . " we think that social networks and the progressive expansion of promotion are very promising , " said emi president roger faxon .
" if we create the right licensing system for this , the music market will continue to blossom .
if not , the pessimists will be proved right and piracy will blossom , but we will not allow this . " and there lies the biggest of the problems facing the music industry in such a self-empowered world : each region has its own licensing systems .
in europe , the record companies were slow to react to the impact of digitization and failed to secure copyrights . now , according to emi 's faxon , international media giants are combining and catching up fast . " we have cooperated with germany 's gema and britain 's alliance -lrb- artist copyright organizations -rrb- to create a pan-european copyright protection organization which simplifies licensing , " he said . taking on illegal downloading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : licensing partnerships can help tackle music piracy as well as securing cross-border licensing agreements for digital media , emi is involved in promoting download services which aim to compete with illegal sites .
its own spiral frog service was set up to provide consumers with higher quality downloads than they could get from file sharing and peer-to-peer platforms . users can download the music for free but the artists do not lose out ; reaping financial benefits from the advertising revenue . the artists themselves still see a silver lining to being illegally downloaded or having their work bootlegged and shown / played on the internet .
will.i.am , singer with the black eyed peas , said that even if someone records part of his band 's show on a mobile phone and then posts it on open broadcasting platform youtube , therefore potentially damaging sales of the show 's dvd release , it 's still not all bad news . a silver lining to music piracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no such thing as bad publicity ...
" our name is out there , " the rapper , producer and composer said .
" it 's on everyone 's lips who saw that clip and that is useful when you 're touring .
if people see you on youtube and like what they see , then they will want to come and see you live . " what does make the black eyed peas nervous is how the music industry reacts to the demise of the cd . " the cd has no market anymore , " will.i.am said .
" the kids today who have all these new toys do n't care about this format that their brother was into years ago .
a product in a plastic cover means nothing these days . " that 's not to say that the companies who produce the product are likely to go the same way .
there still needs to be a record company to groom and promote the next michael jackson or marvin gaye .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 28.01.2007 music industry eyes digital age with growing optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers and sellers mingle with the movers and shakers at midem 2007 in cannes at the 2007 midem music fair in cannes , artists and executives from the music and media industries come to discuss and promote the latest fads and trends .
one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .
" the internet is like an airline , " he said .
" it offers an alternative ; just like television and the radio , the internet is now just another option , another airline you can take .
they will continue to operate in unity and never destroy each other . " cross-border licensing problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists can make huge bounds through myspace even the big media companies seem to hold no fear of the future .
emi , the biggest music publisher in the world , also has high hopes for promotional platforms and the benefits they can bring their artists . " we think that social networks and the progressive expansion of promotion are very promising , " said emi president roger faxon .

one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .
" the internet is like an airline , " he said .
" it offers an alternative ; just like television and the radio , the internet is now just another option , another airline you can take .
they will continue to operate in unity and never destroy each other . " cross-border licensing problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists can make huge bounds through myspace even the big media companies seem to hold no fear of the future .
emi , the biggest music publisher in the world , also has high hopes for promotional platforms and the benefits they can bring their artists . " we think that social networks and the progressive expansion of promotion are very promising , " said emi president roger faxon .
" if we create the right licensing system for this , the music market will continue to blossom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 28.01.2007 music industry eyes digital age with growing optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers and sellers mingle with the movers and shakers at midem 2007 in cannes at the 2007 midem music fair in cannes , artists and executives from the music and media industries come to discuss and promote the latest fads and trends .
one forum tackled the digital age with much optimism . all the talk at the midem international music market 's net forum in cannes on monday was of the digital age and whether artists were getting what they deserved in terms of money and exposure .
most of the participants in the discussion agreed that the advances in technology had done much to secure theirs and music 's future . jeremy dawson , a member of the us band shiny toy guns , was one of the people who expressed his satisfaction with the contribution the internet and digital media had made to the music industry .
citing the example of his band , dawson said that by creating their own identity on myspace , the group had reached a worldwide audience that even the most dynamic record company would have found impossible in the same amount of time . " the social networks have no borders , they are global , " dawson told those attending the forum .
" you can reach any and everybody at any time - every age group , every genre - and they themselves are then used as a marketing tool . " however , dawson believes that the traditional ways of breaking through and creating a fan base , like touring , will never be overtaken by the internet - and should n't .
" the internet is like an airline , " he said .
" it offers an alternative ; just like television and the radio , the internet is now just another option , another airline you can take .
they will continue to operate in unity and never destroy each other . " cross-border licensing problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists can make huge bounds through myspace even the big media companies seem to hold no fear of the future .
emi , the biggest music publisher in the world , also has high hopes for promotional platforms and the benefits they can bring their artists . " we think that social networks and the progressive expansion of promotion are very promising , " said emi president roger faxon .
" if we create the right licensing system for this , the music market will continue to blossom .
if not , the pessimists will be proved right and piracy will blossom , but we will not allow this . " and there lies the biggest of the problems facing the music industry in such a self-empowered world : each region has its own licensing systems .
in europe , the record companies were slow to react to the impact of digitization and failed to secure copyrights . now , according to emi 's faxon , international media giants are combining and catching up fast . " we have cooperated with germany 's gema and britain 's alliance -lrb- artist copyright organizations -rrb- to create a pan-european copyright protection organization which simplifies licensing , " he said . taking on illegal downloading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : licensing partnerships can help tackle music piracy as well as securing cross-border licensing agreements for digital media , emi is involved in promoting download services which aim to compete with illegal sites .
its own spiral frog service was set up to provide consumers with higher quality downloads than they could get from file sharing and peer-to-peer platforms . users can download the music for free but the artists do not lose out ; reaping financial benefits from the advertising revenue . the artists themselves still see a silver lining to being illegally downloaded or having their work bootlegged and shown / played on the internet .
will.i.am , singer with the black eyed peas , said that even if someone records part of his band 's show on a mobile phone and then posts it on open broadcasting platform youtube , therefore potentially damaging sales of the show 's dvd release , it 's still not all bad news . a silver lining to music piracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no such thing as bad publicity ...
" our name is out there , " the rapper , producer and composer said .
" it 's on everyone 's lips who saw that clip and that is useful when you 're touring .
if people see you on youtube and like what they see , then they will want to come and see you live . " what does make the black eyed peas nervous is how the music industry reacts to the demise of the cd . " the cd has no market anymore , " will.i.am said .
" the kids today who have all these new toys do n't care about this format that their brother was into years ago .

" the steep increase in the activities of right-wing extremists and in violent crimes committed by them is worrying us .
we should at last put in place consistent measures to fight the far-right . " she proposed that all european union countries also criminalize the use of nazi insignia . swastika ban plan faces opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hindu symbol was perverted by the third reich this has sparked an angry counter-campaign by hindu groups who say the swastika had been part of their religious symbols for nearly 5,000 years before the nazis appropriated it . germany made holocaust denial a crime in 1985 .
it wants the rest of europe to penalize it by one to three years in prison . beate rudolf , an expert on european law at berlin 's free university , believes the initiative is doomed . " i do not think they will be able to rally all member states behind their proposal .
traditionally , there is too big a difference between members ' practice on this specific issue , " she told afp . rudolf said germany was seeking to make article 13 of the european community treaty more legally binding to fight discrimination . " this is a difficult argument because they are saying that to promote one basic human right you need to limit freedom of speech , which is another basic human right . " she predicted the german proposal would again be opposed by britain , as well as states who " do not think that the power of the eu extends far beyond the economic arena " . prosecution of deniers challenged by intellectuals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving was jailed in austria under its denial laws the persecution of holocaust deniers has been questioned by intellectuals across europe and austria 's jailing of british revisionist historian david irving was strongly criticized . irving was handed a three-year sentence for claiming that adolf hitler had tried to help the jews , but was freed in december after serving 13 months . berlin 's bid could also become bogged down in an argument with the baltic states which want the eu to make it a crime to deny the abuses of the stalinist regime in the soviet union . in germany the prevailing view is that not even the horrors of stalinism could be equated with the holocaust . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german holocaust denial case proceeds as eu moves on a ban as one of the most famous holocaust deniers goes on trial in germany , the eu takes steps to criminalize denying the shoah .

" we have to be careful that biofuel is made in an environmentally friendly way , " she said .
" it does n't make any sense to sacrifice important protected areas or soil and water protection zones for rapeseed and sugar beets for biofuels . " biomass is a solution that lübbeke and zeddies agreed could be an intelligent way to create power and heat in an environmentally friendly way , especially as most of these types of energy comes from coal power plants . replacing the worst polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is already mixed into nearly all germany 's diesel pumps " the question is always what types of energy you are using bioenergy to replace , " said nils rettenmaier of heidelberg 's institute for energy and environmental research .
" and it makes sense to replace the ones that are the most carbon heavy . " rettenmaier added that he feels biofuels are often not used as intelligently as they could be and called on the auto industry not to just make engines that use biofuels but to make more efficient engines in general . " the automobile industry uses biofuels for its lobbying work , " he said .
" it tries to turn attention from its task of building efficient vehicles . " there may be a ray of light coming for rettenmaier and other environmental protection groups from the european union next week .

" it does n't make any sense to sacrifice important protected areas or soil and water protection zones for rapeseed and sugar beets for biofuels . " biomass is a solution that lübbeke and zeddies agreed could be an intelligent way to create power and heat in an environmentally friendly way , especially as most of these types of energy comes from coal power plants . replacing the worst polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is already mixed into nearly all germany 's diesel pumps " the question is always what types of energy you are using bioenergy to replace , " said nils rettenmaier of heidelberg 's institute for energy and environmental research .
" and it makes sense to replace the ones that are the most carbon heavy . " rettenmaier added that he feels biofuels are often not used as intelligently as they could be and called on the auto industry not to just make engines that use biofuels but to make more efficient engines in general . " the automobile industry uses biofuels for its lobbying work , " he said .
" it tries to turn attention from its task of building efficient vehicles . " there may be a ray of light coming for rettenmaier and other environmental protection groups from the european union next week .

but some groups in germany say not all biofuels are created equal . " there should not be a green light for all biofuels , " said imke lübbeke , an energy expert for the german world wildlife fund , adding that some renewable sources of energy are not necessarily good for the environment . but while the wwf and other environmental organizations said that it is irresponsible to cut down large swaths of carbon dioxide absorbing rainforest to make way for renewable crops that could potentially be the power sources of the future , there is still room for europe expand its fields of biofuel producing plants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still has space for more fields of renewable energy producing plants " a million hectares of farmland , that 's 10 percent of cultivable land in germany , are fallow and this standstill is even supported by the government , " said jürgen zeddies , an agricultural economist at the university of hohenheim , adding that some of these fields could be used to grown renewable material for fuels . danger for local flora other environmental protection groups , however , warn that using all the fields for fuel material could lead to the extinction of a number of plant types in germany as soil properties change due to the new crops . that will make it crucial to find environmentally friendly ways of creating biofuel , lübbeke said . " we have to be careful that biofuel is made in an environmentally friendly way , " she said .
" it does n't make any sense to sacrifice important protected areas or soil and water protection zones for rapeseed and sugar beets for biofuels . " biomass is a solution that lübbeke and zeddies agreed could be an intelligent way to create power and heat in an environmentally friendly way , especially as most of these types of energy comes from coal power plants . replacing the worst polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is already mixed into nearly all germany 's diesel pumps " the question is always what types of energy you are using bioenergy to replace , " said nils rettenmaier of heidelberg 's institute for energy and environmental research .
" and it makes sense to replace the ones that are the most carbon heavy . " rettenmaier added that he feels biofuels are often not used as intelligently as they could be and called on the auto industry not to just make engines that use biofuels but to make more efficient engines in general . " the automobile industry uses biofuels for its lobbying work , " he said .
" it tries to turn attention from its task of building efficient vehicles . " there may be a ray of light coming for rettenmaier and other environmental protection groups from the european union next week .

labour had originally planned compulsory lie detector tests for sex offenders in its 2005 general election manifesto .
confirmation of the plan comes as the news of the world reported police forces across the uk have lost track of the whereabouts of 322 convicted sex offenders , a newspaper has reported .

the local council next month launches a year long pilot in which developers will have to show the potential impact of their schemes on the language .
councillors used the language argument to block a multi-million pound extension to pwllheli marina .
the council leader is adamant that it will not deter investment and jobs .
but one chamber of trade has already expressed concern that the guidance may put off businesses from investing .
under the scheme , developers will have to show their plans will not have an adverse effect on the welsh language , or else their application may be rejected for that reason .
proposals affected will include commercial , industrial or tourism developments of 1000 square metres or more , and developments of five or more homes on sites not already designated for such use . "
gwynedd is open for business and we welcome into gwynedd people from all kinds of backgrounds and always will do . "
council leader richard parry hughes sixty nine per cent of people in gwynedd speak welsh - the highest proportion in any welsh county .
but the 2001 census showed welsh speakers there had fallen three percent in the last 10 years plaid cymru-led gwynedd council insisted it would still continue to welcome business , but language issues needed to be addressed .
leader coun richard parry hughes said : " gwynedd is open for business and we welcome into gwynedd people from all kinds of backgrounds and always will do .
" but i think there is a planning issue here which we need to tackle and i think it 'll be much clearer for people who are coming here and developers to get clear guidance on what 's expected of them . "
the authority argues that existing advice does not give planners enough ammunition to block developments which could harm the language and they were leading the way for other counties in wales .
" we would expect the government of wales to be actually leading on these kind of policies and they have n't been leading on them , " said mr parry hughes .
but the chair of pwllheli 's chamber of trade paul brett said they were worried that very viable investments into the area would be turned away because of the guidance .
" we need to see what 's going to happen and how .
" if they implement it politically it could do a great deal of damage to the county economically . "
others who welcome the new guidance are worried about how wisely it will be applied .
councillors have already used to language argument to block a £ 3.8m project to extend pwllheli marina which had been approved by board members .
martin eaglestone , prospective labour candidate for arfon , said they had to hope that authorities like gwynedd were " very sensible " .
" it 's important that if we do carry out these assessments they 're done in the proper way , that there is an informed debate and that we reach the right decisions and do n't jump to conclusions . "

the local council next month launches a year long pilot in which developers will have to show the potential impact of their schemes on the language .
councillors used the language argument to block a multi-million pound extension to pwllheli marina .
the council leader is adamant that it will not deter investment and jobs .
but one chamber of trade has already expressed concern that the guidance may put off businesses from investing .
under the scheme , developers will have to show their plans will not have an adverse effect on the welsh language , or else their application may be rejected for that reason .
proposals affected will include commercial , industrial or tourism developments of 1000 square metres or more , and developments of five or more homes on sites not already designated for such use .
gwynedd is open for business and we welcome into gwynedd people from all kinds of backgrounds and always will do .
council leader richard parry hughes sixty nine per cent of people in gwynedd speak welsh - the highest proportion in any welsh county .
but the 2001 census showed welsh speakers there had fallen three percent in the last 10 years plaid cymru-led gwynedd council insisted it would still continue to welcome business , but language issues needed to be addressed .
leader coun richard parry hughes said : " gwynedd is open for business and we welcome into gwynedd people from all kinds of backgrounds and always will do .
" but i think there is a planning issue here which we need to tackle and i think it 'll be much clearer for people who are coming here and developers to get clear guidance on what 's expected of them . "
the authority argues that existing advice does not give planners enough ammunition to block developments which could harm the language and they were leading the way for other counties in wales .
the council said it expected more assembly leadership on the issue " we would expect the government of wales to be actually leading on these kind of policies and they have n't been leading on them , " said mr parry hughes .
but the chair of pwllheli 's chamber of trade paul brett said they were worried that very viable investments into the area would be turned away because of the guidance .
" we need to see what 's going to happen and how .
" if they implement it politically it could do a great deal of damage to the county economically . "
others who welcome the new guidance are worried about how wisely it will be applied .
councillors have already used to language argument to block a £ 3.8m project to extend pwllheli marina which had been approved by board members .

brazil nuts are a valuable food source with a huge market in europe and north america : up to 7,000 tonnes of unshelled nuts and 20,000 tonnes of shelled nuts are shipped every year .
and because the trees that supply the nuts grow wild , they offer a way for communities to make a living from the forest without destroying it - something that is now being put to use in the country .
" this is a real financial resource for communities , " dr rafael salomao , who works at the museu goeldi , one of the most important centres for the study of the amazon , told bbc world service 's one planet programme .
" a tree which is over 400 years old can provide for generations and generations . "
tree cemeteries brazil nuts are considered to be one of the most valuable products that can be harvested from undisturbed rainforest .
the nuts , known to brazilians as castanha do para , grow uniquely in the amazon basin .
they are hazardous to collect : each hard outer shell weighs over 1kg . "
unfortunately , when they have talked about sanctuaries - places where you ca n't touch any plants at all - well , they do n't exist " hans muller , embrapa institute however , they offer an alternative to the way that many areas of brazil are trying to develop - by clearing the forest to create areas suitable for either grazing cattle or growing products such as soya .
for many years , this meant the destruction of brazil nut trees , even after they became officially protected .
" sadly , today , we have cemeteries of brazil nut trees , " said dr salomao .
" it 's because of the arrival of agriculture .
we call it the ' agricultural frontier ' , which goes along with cattle ranching .
" when this arrives , they destroy the forest .
first , they exploit the valuable wood , and then the cattle ranchers come and turn it into pasture .
" having said that , they keep the brazil nut trees as well as the rubber trees , as these are legally protected .
but they burn the forest to clear the land and the brazil nut tree is very sensitive to fire .
after three years of repeating this process , the trees are dead . "
what is worse for brazil nut collectors is that once the trees have been destroyed , there is little chance of getting them back .
attempts to replace them have been largely unsuccessful .
saplings will not grow in shade and take up to 15 years to begin producing nuts .
" brazil nut trees do not have an easy natural regeneration , " said hans muller , who works at belem 's embrapa institute , specialising in agricultural research in the amazon .
" when you destroy one , it 's a real loss .
" unfortunately , when they have talked about sanctuaries - places where you ca n't touch any plants at all - well , they do n't exist . "
incentives however , at the end of 2006 , the governor of the large state of para announced a protected reserve of 16.4 million hectares of forest , with the aim of creating a huge conservation corridor through northern amazon .
and in the state over para 's northern border , amapa , small communities are taking to the challenge of using the brazil nut to generate income from the rainforest without destroying it .
" we had this idea , we 've a vast resource of brazil nuts and we needed to create organisations in the region in order to strengthen local production , " said ajama da silva mendes , from the amapa state department of industry , commerce and minerals .
" so the government gave some incentives to create co-ops , together with the communities .
" now we can see the promise of bigger production and better living conditions for rural workers . "
brazil nut gatherers and their families are now able to maintain a decent livelihood .
and small-scale factories have been set up producing brazil nut biscuits and oil , broadening the range of products available for export , meaning there is a better way for people to get a fair price for their valuable resource .
but there are further problems .
subsidised production in bolivia is challenging brazil 's dominance in the market .
and when , in 2004 , the european union found that brazil nuts with shells on had traces of aflatoxins , which can cause liver cancer , strong regulations were put in place regarding the nuts .
while the american limit on aflatoxin levels in brazil nuts is 15 parts per billion , the european limit is just four parts per billion .
this has hit brazil nut exporters hard .
" in case the product does n't meet the eu 's laws , all the costs which have arisen have to be paid by the exporter , " said benedito mutra emfilio , chair of association of brazil nut exporters .
" this is impossible . "

brazil nuts are a valuable food source with a huge market in europe and north america : up to 7,000 tonnes of unshelled nuts and 20,000 tonnes of shelled nuts are shipped every year .
and because the trees that supply the nuts grow wild , they offer a way for communities to make a living from the forest without destroying it - something that is now being put to use in the country .
" this is a real financial resource for communities , " dr rafael salomao , who works at the museu goeldi , one of the most important centres for the study of the amazon , told bbc world service 's one planet programme .
" a tree which is over 400 years old can provide for generations and generations . "
tree cemeteries brazil nuts are considered to be one of the most valuable products that can be harvested from undisturbed rainforest .
the nuts , known to brazilians as castanha do para , grow uniquely in the amazon basin .
they are hazardous to collect : each hard outer shell weighs over 1kg .
unfortunately , when they have talked about sanctuaries - places where you ca n't touch any plants at all - well , they do n't exist hans muller , embrapa institute however , they offer an alternative to the way that many areas of brazil are trying to develop - by clearing the forest to create areas suitable for either grazing cattle or growing products such as soya .
for many years , this meant the destruction of brazil nut trees , even after they became officially protected .
" sadly , today , we have cemeteries of brazil nut trees , " said dr salomao .
" it 's because of the arrival of agriculture .
we call it the ' agricultural frontier ' , which goes along with cattle ranching .
" when this arrives , they destroy the forest .
first , they exploit the valuable wood , and then the cattle ranchers come and turn it into pasture .
" having said that , they keep the brazil nut trees as well as the rubber trees , as these are legally protected .
but they burn the forest to clear the land and the brazil nut tree is very sensitive to fire .
after three years of repeating this process , the trees are dead . "
what is worse for brazil nut collectors is that once the trees have been destroyed , there is little chance of getting them back .
attempts to replace them have been largely unsuccessful .
saplings will not grow in shade and take up to 15 years to begin producing nuts .
" brazil nut trees do not have an easy natural regeneration , " said hans muller , who works at belem 's embrapa institute , specialising in agricultural research in the amazon .
" when you destroy one , it 's a real loss .
" unfortunately , when they have talked about sanctuaries - places where you ca n't touch any plants at all - well , they do n't exist . "
incentives however , at the end of 2006 , the governor of the large state of para announced a protected reserve of 16.4 million hectares of forest , with the aim of creating a huge conservation corridor through northern amazon .
amapa is home to the largest rainforest reserve in the world and in the state over para 's northern border , amapa , small communities are taking to the challenge of using the brazil nut to generate income from the rainforest without destroying it .
" we had this idea , we 've a vast resource of brazil nuts and we needed to create organisations in the region in order to strengthen local production , " said ajama da silva mendes , from the amapa state department of industry , commerce and minerals .
" so the government gave some incentives to create co-ops , together with the communities .
" now we can see the promise of bigger production and better living conditions for rural workers . "
brazil nut gatherers and their families are now able to maintain a decent livelihood .
and small-scale factories have been set up producing brazil nut biscuits and oil , broadening the range of products available for export , meaning there is a better way for people to get a fair price for their valuable resource .

and when , in 2004 , the european union found that brazil nuts with shells on had traces of aflatoxins , which can cause liver cancer , strong regulations were put in place regarding the nuts .
while the american limit on aflatoxin levels in brazil nuts is 15 parts per billion , the european limit is just four parts per billion .

this ard fheis supports civic policing through a police service which is representative of the community it serves , free from partisan political control and democratically accountable .
we support fair , impartial and effective delivery of the rule of law .
the changes to policing secured in legislation need to be implemented fully .
the truth about wrongdoing by british military , intelligence and policing agencies needs to be uncovered and acknowledged .
sinn fein supports the demands for this from the families of victims .
psni trust the psni needs to make strenuous efforts to earn the trust and confidence of nationalists and republicans .
gardai corruption and malpractice - which has been exposed in the morris tribunal and the abbeylara inquiry in the 26 counties - shows the need for constant vigilance and oversight .
these inquiries and the ill-treatment of republicans by the garda special branch also provide compelling reasons as to why the responsibility of political parties and representatives should be to hold the police to account in a fair and publicly transparent way .
this ard fheis is totally opposed to political , sectarian and repressive policing .
the experience of nationalists and republicans in the six counties is of a partisan , unionist militia which engaged in harassment , torture , assassination , shoot-to-kill and collusion with death squads .
the good friday agreement requires and defines " a new beginning to policing " as an essential element of the peace process .
the good friday agreement also requires functioning , power-sharing and all-ireland political institutions .
the british government has agreed to the transfer of powers on policing and justice away from westminster to locally-elected political institutions and have set out the departmental model to which these powers will be transferred .
in these circumstances authority over policing and justice will lie in ireland .
' civic policing ' we note the british government 's new policy statement of 10 january 2007 which removes mi5 from policing structures in ireland .
this removes the proposals to embed mi5 into civic policing and removes the danger of again creating a force within a force .
we note also the commitment by psni chief constable hugh orde that plastic bullets will not be used for purposes of public order / crowd control and his acknowledgement of the hurt resulting from injuries and death of innocent people , including children .
these weapons should never be used again .
sinn fein will continue to campaign for a total ban .
this ard fheis notes the refusal of the dup leader ian paisley to publicly commit to power-sharing and participation in the all-ireland political institutions by 26 march 2007 .
before the ard chomhairle meeting on 29 december , the dup had agreed words which they would release in response to the ard chomhairle accepting the policing motion put by the party president .
we note the dup 's failure to keep to this commitment .
it is clear that elements of the dup are determined to use policing and other issues to prevent progress , resist power-sharing and equality and oppose any all-ireland development .
this is unacceptable .
' justice ' it is the responsibility of the two governments and pro-agreement parties across the island to resist this and to ensure the full implementation of the good friday agreement .
sinn fein is committed to justice .
sinn fein is committed to law and order and to stable and inclusive partnership government , and , in good faith and in a spirit of genuine partnership , to the full operation of stable power-sharing government and the north-south and east-west arrangements set out in the good friday agreement .
the responsibility of the police is to defend and uphold the rights of citizens .
in order to fulfil this role they require critical support .
sinn fein reiterates our support for an garda siochana and commits fully to : support for the psni and the criminal justice system .
hold the police and criminal justice systems north and south fully to account , both democratically and legally , on the basis of fairness and impartiality and objectivity .
authorise our elected representatives to participate in local policing structures in the interests of justice , the quality of life for the community and to secure policing with the community as the core function of the psni and actively encouraging everyone in the community to co-operate fully with the police services in tackling crime in all areas and actively supporting all the criminal justice institutions .
the devolution of policing and justice to the assembly .
equality equality and human rights at the heart of the new dispensation and to pursue a shared future in which the culture , rights and aspirations of all are respected and valued , free from sectarianism , racism and intolerance .
to achieve this the ard chomhairle is hereby mandated to : appoint sinn fein representatives to the policing board and the district policing partnership boards to ensure that : - a civic policing service ; accountable and representative of the community is delivered as quickly as possible ; the chief constable and the psni are publicly held to account ; policing with the community is achieved as the core function of the psni ; political policing ; collusion and " the force within a force " is a thing of the past and to oppose any involvement by the british security service / mi5 in civic policing .
ensure sinn fein representatives robustly support the demands for : - equality of treatment for all victims and survivors - effective truth recovery mechanisms ; acknowledgement by the british state of its involvement in wrongdoing including collusion with loyalist paramilitaries ; to ensure that there is no place in the psni for those guilty of human rights abuses .
resolutely oppose the use of lethal weapons in public order situations , authorise sinn fein ministers to take the ministerial pledge of office , achieve accountable all-ireland policing structures .
the ard chomhairle recommends : that this ard fheis endorses the ard chomhairle motion .
that the ard chomhairle is mandated to implement this motion only when the power-sharing institutions are established and when the ard chomhairle is satisfied that the policing and justice powers will be transferred .

this ard fheis supports civic policing through a police service which is representative of the community it serves , free from partisan political control and democratically accountable .
we support fair , impartial and effective delivery of the rule of law .
the changes to policing secured in legislation need to be implemented fully .
the truth about wrongdoing by british military , intelligence and policing agencies needs to be uncovered and acknowledged .
sinn fein supports the demands for this from the families of victims .
psni trust the psni needs to make strenuous efforts to earn the trust and confidence of nationalists and republicans .
gardai corruption and malpractice - which has been exposed in the morris tribunal and the abbeylara inquiry in the 26 counties - shows the need for constant vigilance and oversight .
these inquiries and the ill-treatment of republicans by the garda special branch also provide compelling reasons as to why the responsibility of political parties and representatives should be to hold the police to account in a fair and publicly transparent way .
this ard fheis is totally opposed to political , sectarian and repressive policing .
the experience of nationalists and republicans in the six counties is of a partisan , unionist militia which engaged in harassment , torture , assassination , shoot-to-kill and collusion with death squads .
the good friday agreement requires and defines " a new beginning to policing " as an essential element of the peace process .
the good friday agreement also requires functioning , power-sharing and all-ireland political institutions .
the british government has agreed to the transfer of powers on policing and justice away from westminster to locally-elected political institutions and have set out the departmental model to which these powers will be transferred .
in these circumstances authority over policing and justice will lie in ireland .
' civic policing ' we note the british government 's new policy statement of 10 january 2007 which removes mi5 from policing structures in ireland .
this removes the proposals to embed mi5 into civic policing and removes the danger of again creating a force within a force .
we note also the commitment by psni chief constable hugh orde that plastic bullets will not be used for purposes of public order / crowd control and his acknowledgement of the hurt resulting from injuries and death of innocent people , including children .
these weapons should never be used again .
sinn fein will continue to campaign for a total ban .
this ard fheis notes the refusal of the dup leader ian paisley to publicly commit to power-sharing and participation in the all-ireland political institutions by 26 march 2007 .
before the ard chomhairle meeting on 29 december , the dup had agreed words which they would release in response to the ard chomhairle accepting the policing motion put by the party president .
we note the dup 's failure to keep to this commitment .
it is clear that elements of the dup are determined to use policing and other issues to prevent progress , resist power-sharing and equality and oppose any all-ireland development .
this is unacceptable .
' justice ' it is the responsibility of the two governments and pro-agreement parties across the island to resist this and to ensure the full implementation of the good friday agreement .
sinn fein is committed to justice .
sinn fein is committed to law and order and to stable and inclusive partnership government , and , in good faith and in a spirit of genuine partnership , to the full operation of stable power-sharing government and the north-south and east-west arrangements set out in the good friday agreement .
the responsibility of the police is to defend and uphold the rights of citizens .
in order to fulfil this role they require critical support .
sinn fein reiterates our support for an garda siochana and commits fully to : support for the psni and the criminal justice system .
hold the police and criminal justice systems north and south fully to account , both democratically and legally , on the basis of fairness and impartiality and objectivity .
authorise our elected representatives to participate in local policing structures in the interests of justice , the quality of life for the community and to secure policing with the community as the core function of the psni and actively encouraging everyone in the community to co-operate fully with the police services in tackling crime in all areas and actively supporting all the criminal justice institutions .
the devolution of policing and justice to the assembly .
equality equality and human rights at the heart of the new dispensation and to pursue a shared future in which the culture , rights and aspirations of all are respected and valued , free from sectarianism , racism and intolerance .
to achieve this the ard chomhairle is hereby mandated to : appoint sinn fein representatives to the policing board and the district policing partnership boards to ensure that : - a civic policing service ; accountable and representative of the community is delivered as quickly as possible ; the chief constable and the psni are publicly held to account ; policing with the community is achieved as the core function of the psni ; political policing ; collusion and " the force within a force " is a thing of the past and to oppose any involvement by the british security service / mi5 in civic policing .
ensure sinn fein representatives robustly support the demands for : - equality of treatment for all victims and survivors - effective truth recovery mechanisms ; acknowledgement by the british state of its involvement in wrongdoing including collusion with loyalist paramilitaries ; to ensure that there is no place in the psni for those guilty of human rights abuses .
resolutely oppose the use of lethal weapons in public order situations , authorise sinn fein ministers to take the ministerial pledge of office , achieve accountable all-ireland policing structures .
the ard chomhairle recommends : that this ard fheis endorses the ard chomhairle motion .
that the ard chomhairle is mandated to implement this motion only when the power-sharing institutions are established and when the ard chomhairle is satisfied that the policing and justice powers will be transferred .
or if this does not happen within the st andrews timeframe , only when acceptable new partnership arrangements to implement the good friday agreement are in place .
