4 for talks with us president george w. bush that are expected to touch upon the middle east , afghanistan , iraq , iran and kosovo . the relationship between germany and the united states hit a low when merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , strongly opposed the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
but since merkel 's time in office , transatlantic ties have warmed considerably . " we want to talk about ever-closer economic cooperation .
our economic systems are based on the same values , " she told the financial times newspaper .
" we should be looking for ways to keep developing these together at a transatlantic level . " we must watch out that we do not drift apart but instead come closer together , where there are clear advantages for both sides .

" germany 's six-month presidency of the european union began earlier this week and merkel is also chair of the g8 for 2007 . russian energy questioned about europe 's reliance on russian energy imports , merkel warned that relations between the two must be based on reciprocity . " if obstacles are being erected to protect russian companies from european investors , nobody should resent it if the europeans take reciprocal action , " she told the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has n't been afraid to speak her mind to putin , diplomatically , of course on russian human rights , she said she had repeatedly told president vladimir putin that " contrary opinions are a normal part of society " , adding that russia 's tough attitude towards non-governmental organisations " gives ground for concern . " merkel also seemed to baulk at the suggestion by french interior minister nicolas sarkozy , an all-but-certain presidential candidate , that the troubled european constitution could be revived as a mini-constitution . taking a more optimistic view , she said there was " an entirely new sentiment about the raison d 'etre of the eu " and said germany would not approach the issue " from a minimalist position .

" further delay in the release of this archive material would be unjust to holocaust survivors - virtually all of whom are now elderly - still seeking compensation for the unspeakable crimes of the nazi regime , " senator joseph biden , a member of the democratic party who takes over the senate committee thursday , wrote in a letter to british ambassador sir david manning .

prior german concerns over privacy rights had kept the files closed for five decades . the ongoing delay is due to the member countries ' failing to ratify the agreement at home .

" we know that so much information has been hidden , and there have been so many surprises when these nazi records are actually examined , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 03.01.2007 " a deadly fusion of ideology and material interest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler , says historian götz aly , was a " people 's dictator " in 2005 , götz aly landed a bestseller with a study of how ordinary germans , in addition to bankers and industrialists , benefited under nazism .
now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .

we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .

that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 03.01.2007 " a deadly fusion of ideology and material interest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler , says historian götz aly , was a " people 's dictator " in 2005 , götz aly landed a bestseller with a study of how ordinary germans , in addition to bankers and industrialists , benefited under nazism .
now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

the ninth consecutive monthly decline , the december jobless rate is the lowest since august 2002 , from 10.1 percent . as one of the first key pieces of german economic data to be released in 2007 , the unemployment figures are likely to add to expectations that the strong economic momentum built up in the country last year will help to propel the world 's third-largest economy behind the united states and japan through the coming 12 months . mild weather and economic upturn labor office chief frank-jürgen weise pointed to germany 's unseasonably mild winter weather as helping to underpin the nation 's labor market .
last month was the warmest december in germany in 32 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been germany 's biggest headache " the decline in unemployment in december " is primarily due to the positive economic situation , but unusually mild weather has also played a role , " weise said wednesday . commerzbank ag economist matthias rubisch echoed weise 's comments .
" the positive tendency on the labor market is partly the result of the dynamic economic development and as a result is likely to continue in the coming months , " rubisch told news agency dpa . the upturn was evident during the buoyant christmas shopping season which delighted retailers even though higher sales were partly attributed to advance purchases to avoid the three-point hike in the vat -lrb- sales tax -rrb- to 19 percent at the start of 2007 . underlining the optimistic outlook for germany , one of the nation 's leading economic institutes , the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- on wednesday revised upwards its economic growth projections for the year . despite a slowing global economy and the vat hike , the diw expects the nation 's growth rate to come in at 1.7 per cent this year compared to a previous forecast of 1.4 per cent .
europe 's biggest economy should then accelerate to 2.5 per cent next year , the diw said .
germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation last year to post what the diw expects to be a 2.3 per cent growth rate in 2006 . companies announce hiring the declining unemployment suggests that europe 's largest economy may not be adversely affected by chancellor angela merkel 's three percentage-point increase in sales tax on jan .

other german companies such as continental ag and adidas ag plan to raise spending and hire new staff as profits rise . herbert hainer , chief executive of adidas , the sporting goods maker , said last month that while the company was expanding the most in markets like russia and china , it was also growing in germany , where it plans to create about 100 jobs in 2007 . " the german economy is ready to take off , " axel heitmann , chief executive of lanxess , a chemical maker that plans to hire at least 100 new people and invest 4 percent of sales , told daily international herald tribune .

the ninth consecutive monthly decline , the december jobless rate is the lowest since august 2002 , from 10.1 percent . as one of the first key pieces of german economic data to be released in 2007 , the unemployment figures are likely to add to expectations that the strong economic momentum built up in the country last year will help to propel the world 's third-largest economy behind the united states and japan through the coming 12 months . mild weather and economic upturn labor office chief frank-jürgen weise pointed to germany 's unseasonably mild winter weather as helping to underpin the nation 's labor market .
last month was the warmest december in germany in 32 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been germany 's biggest headache " the decline in unemployment in december " is primarily due to the positive economic situation , but unusually mild weather has also played a role , " weise said wednesday . commerzbank ag economist matthias rubisch echoed weise 's comments .
" the positive tendency on the labor market is partly the result of the dynamic economic development and as a result is likely to continue in the coming months , " rubisch told news agency dpa . the upturn was evident during the buoyant christmas shopping season which delighted retailers even though higher sales were partly attributed to advance purchases to avoid the three-point hike in the vat -lrb- sales tax -rrb- to 19 percent at the start of 2007 . underlining the optimistic outlook for germany , one of the nation 's leading economic institutes , the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- on wednesday revised upwards its economic growth projections for the year . despite a slowing global economy and the vat hike , the diw expects the nation 's growth rate to come in at 1.7 per cent this year compared to a previous forecast of 1.4 per cent .
europe 's biggest economy should then accelerate to 2.5 per cent next year , the diw said .
germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation last year to post what the diw expects to be a 2.3 per cent growth rate in 2006 . companies announce hiring the declining unemployment suggests that europe 's largest economy may not be adversely affected by chancellor angela merkel 's three percentage-point increase in sales tax on jan .
1 . " we 're in a truly upbeat economic environment , " stefan bielmeier , a fixed-income strategist at deutsche bank ag told news agency bloomberg .
" companies have good reason to consider hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa plans to create 3,000 new jobs that 's exactly what some firms are doing . deutsche lufthansa ag , europe 's second-biggest airline , plans to create 3,000 new jobs in germany this year to meet growing demand in the region .
other german companies such as continental ag and adidas ag plan to raise spending and hire new staff as profits rise . herbert hainer , chief executive of adidas , the sporting goods maker , said last month that while the company was expanding the most in markets like russia and china , it was also growing in germany , where it plans to create about 100 jobs in 2007 . " the german economy is ready to take off , " axel heitmann , chief executive of lanxess , a chemical maker that plans to hire at least 100 new people and invest 4 percent of sales , told daily international herald tribune .
" besides an unchanged strength in exports , increasing capital investment and private consumption is contributing .
i 'm optimistic for 2007 . " the dihk industry and trade chambers , which represents more than 3 million companies , said last week that german firms , including businesses in the chemical , engineering and automobile sectors , may create as many as 30,000 new jobs this year . germany most competitive economy in euro zone the flood of good economic news , a sharp departure from the gloom and self-doubt that has pervaded the country in recent years , received a further fillip this week with a survey published by business daily handelsblatt saying that germany is now regarded as the most competitive economy in the 13-nation euro single currency area . on a scale of 1 -lrb- very good -rrb- to 5 -lrb- very bad -rrb- , the survey of 1,175 european top executives gave germany an average grade of 2.5 , up from 2.8 , and only behind china -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- and switzerland -lrb- 2.4 -rrb- . part of germany 's perceived competitiveness in the survey was due to economic reforms pursued by chancellor angela merkel , according to the handelsblatt . " 56 percent of german executives are sure that the government led by merkel had improved the competitiveness of german companies , " the paper said . expert says no straying from reform path klaus mangold , federal commissioner for foreign investments , confirmed the survey 's findings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic prospects look rosy " the country has become more competitive , " mangold told daily saarbrücker zeitung .
he added that germany 's image abroad as a business destination had significantly improved and the moderate rise in wages in recent years had contributed to the fact that germany " is no longer a hugely expensive business location . " at the same time , mangold said , international investors now expect germany not to remain idle . " that applies particularly to the areas of taxation and non-wage labor costs , " mangold said , adding that the german government would now be judged on how seriously it pursued and implemented further reform . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .

the paper quoted a spokesman for the state prosecutor in nuremberg as saying : " the prosecutor is investigating whether siemens contravened the law on foreign trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program was meant to help meet everyday needs of iraqis the spokesman said the allegations against siemens concerned mainly its energy and medical equipment operations and involved a six-figure sum .
the money was allegedly paid as a bribe to saddam hussein 's regime to secure contracts as part of the un-supervised food-for-oil program which ran from late 1996 to 2003 .
the program allowed the iraqi government to sell limited amounts of oil to purchase essential goods to alleviate the effects of sanctions on the civilian population .
similar accusations at linde in late december , state prosecutors in munich said they had opened an investigation into german oil giant linde , which faces similar accusations over the food-for-oil program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linde is also under investigation an investigation ordered by un secretary general kofi annan found in 2005 that more than 2,000 companies from 60 countries bribed saddam hussein 's government to be allowed to take part in the program .
a siemens spokesman told afx news : " we are cooperating with the public prosecutor .
but it is important to put this into context and realize that it is part of a wider investigation concerning several companies which took part in the oil-for-food program . "
other charges pending siemens is also facing an investigation by german prosecutors over alleged embezzlement , bribery and tax evasion .
some employees are suspected of collaborating in opening slush fund accounts abroad , which are used for making illicit payments , and of operating a system to embezzle company money .
seven former and current employees were arrested late last year but freed before christmas after they made statements to prosecutors . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens corruption scandal deepens although munich state prosecutors have freed a group of men accused of running slush funds at the engineering giant siemens , they announced on friday that the case was growing in strength .
-lrb- 22.12.2006 -rrb- germany considers tighter ceo laws the siemens bribery scandal has caused the german government to consider forbidding retired ceos from moving over to head their companies ' supervisory boards , according to a report released this week .

the ninth consecutive monthly decline , the december jobless rate is the lowest since august 2002 , from 10.1 percent . as one of the first key pieces of german economic data to be released in 2007 , the unemployment figures are likely to add to expectations that the strong economic momentum built up in the country last year will help to propel the world 's third-largest economy behind the united states and japan through the coming 12 months . mild weather and economic upturn labor office chief frank-jürgen weise pointed to germany 's unseasonably mild winter weather as helping to underpin the nation 's labor market .
last month was the warmest december in germany in 32 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been germany 's biggest headache " the decline in unemployment in december " is primarily due to the positive economic situation , but unusually mild weather has also played a role , " weise said wednesday . commerzbank ag economist matthias rubisch echoed weise 's comments .
" the positive tendency on the labor market is partly the result of the dynamic economic development and as a result is likely to continue in the coming months , " rubisch told news agency dpa . the upturn was evident during the buoyant christmas shopping season which delighted retailers even though higher sales were partly attributed to advance purchases to avoid the three-point hike in the vat -lrb- sales tax -rrb- to 19 percent at the start of 2007 . underlining the optimistic outlook for germany , one of the nation 's leading economic institutes , the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- on wednesday revised upwards its economic growth projections for the year . despite a slowing global economy and the vat hike , the diw expects the nation 's growth rate to come in at 1.7 per cent this year compared to a previous forecast of 1.4 per cent .
europe 's biggest economy should then accelerate to 2.5 per cent next year , the diw said .
germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation last year to post what the diw expects to be a 2.3 per cent growth rate in 2006 . companies announce hiring the declining unemployment suggests that europe 's largest economy may not be adversely affected by chancellor angela merkel 's three percentage-point increase in sales tax on jan .
1 . " we 're in a truly upbeat economic environment , " stefan bielmeier , a fixed-income strategist at deutsche bank ag told news agency bloomberg .
" companies have good reason to consider hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa plans to create 3,000 new jobs that 's exactly what some firms are doing . deutsche lufthansa ag , europe 's second-biggest airline , plans to create 3,000 new jobs in germany this year to meet growing demand in the region .
other german companies such as continental ag and adidas ag plan to raise spending and hire new staff as profits rise . herbert hainer , chief executive of adidas , the sporting goods maker , said last month that while the company was expanding the most in markets like russia and china , it was also growing in germany , where it plans to create about 100 jobs in 2007 . " the german economy is ready to take off , " axel heitmann , chief executive of lanxess , a chemical maker that plans to hire at least 100 new people and invest 4 percent of sales , told daily international herald tribune .
" besides an unchanged strength in exports , increasing capital investment and private consumption is contributing .
i 'm optimistic for 2007 . " the dihk industry and trade chambers , which represents more than 3 million companies , said last week that german firms , including businesses in the chemical , engineering and automobile sectors , may create as many as 30,000 new jobs this year . germany most competitive economy in euro zone the flood of good economic news , a sharp departure from the gloom and self-doubt that has pervaded the country in recent years , received a further fillip this week with a survey published by business daily handelsblatt saying that germany is now regarded as the most competitive economy in the 13-nation euro single currency area . on a scale of 1 -lrb- very good -rrb- to 5 -lrb- very bad -rrb- , the survey of 1,175 european top executives gave germany an average grade of 2.5 , up from 2.8 , and only behind china -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- and switzerland -lrb- 2.4 -rrb- . part of germany 's perceived competitiveness in the survey was due to economic reforms pursued by chancellor angela merkel , according to the handelsblatt . " 56 percent of german executives are sure that the government led by merkel had improved the competitiveness of german companies , " the paper said . expert says no straying from reform path klaus mangold , federal commissioner for foreign investments , confirmed the survey 's findings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic prospects look rosy " the country has become more competitive , " mangold told daily saarbrücker zeitung .
he added that germany 's image abroad as a business destination had significantly improved and the moderate rise in wages in recent years had contributed to the fact that germany " is no longer a hugely expensive business location . " at the same time , mangold said , international investors now expect germany not to remain idle .

now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.01.2007 buoyed by good news , german economy steams ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowhere is the german economic boom more evident than in the construction industry germany 's economic upswing got a further boost this week with news of a continuing fall in jobless numbers and a survey showing the country to be the most competitive of the 13 economies sharing the euro . german unemployment , the country 's biggest headache for over a decade , fell by a seasonally adjusted 108,000 in december to 4.12 million or 9.8 percent of the workforce , the nuremberg-based federal labor office said wednesday .
the ninth consecutive monthly decline , the december jobless rate is the lowest since august 2002 , from 10.1 percent . as one of the first key pieces of german economic data to be released in 2007 , the unemployment figures are likely to add to expectations that the strong economic momentum built up in the country last year will help to propel the world 's third-largest economy behind the united states and japan through the coming 12 months . mild weather and economic upturn labor office chief frank-jürgen weise pointed to germany 's unseasonably mild winter weather as helping to underpin the nation 's labor market .
last month was the warmest december in germany in 32 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been germany 's biggest headache " the decline in unemployment in december " is primarily due to the positive economic situation , but unusually mild weather has also played a role , " weise said wednesday . commerzbank ag economist matthias rubisch echoed weise 's comments .
" the positive tendency on the labor market is partly the result of the dynamic economic development and as a result is likely to continue in the coming months , " rubisch told news agency dpa . the upturn was evident during the buoyant christmas shopping season which delighted retailers even though higher sales were partly attributed to advance purchases to avoid the three-point hike in the vat -lrb- sales tax -rrb- to 19 percent at the start of 2007 . underlining the optimistic outlook for germany , one of the nation 's leading economic institutes , the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- on wednesday revised upwards its economic growth projections for the year . despite a slowing global economy and the vat hike , the diw expects the nation 's growth rate to come in at 1.7 per cent this year compared to a previous forecast of 1.4 per cent .
europe 's biggest economy should then accelerate to 2.5 per cent next year , the diw said .
germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation last year to post what the diw expects to be a 2.3 per cent growth rate in 2006 . companies announce hiring the declining unemployment suggests that europe 's largest economy may not be adversely affected by chancellor angela merkel 's three percentage-point increase in sales tax on jan .
1 . " we 're in a truly upbeat economic environment , " stefan bielmeier , a fixed-income strategist at deutsche bank ag told news agency bloomberg .
" companies have good reason to consider hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa plans to create 3,000 new jobs that 's exactly what some firms are doing . deutsche lufthansa ag , europe 's second-biggest airline , plans to create 3,000 new jobs in germany this year to meet growing demand in the region .
other german companies such as continental ag and adidas ag plan to raise spending and hire new staff as profits rise . herbert hainer , chief executive of adidas , the sporting goods maker , said last month that while the company was expanding the most in markets like russia and china , it was also growing in germany , where it plans to create about 100 jobs in 2007 . " the german economy is ready to take off , " axel heitmann , chief executive of lanxess , a chemical maker that plans to hire at least 100 new people and invest 4 percent of sales , told daily international herald tribune .
" besides an unchanged strength in exports , increasing capital investment and private consumption is contributing .
i 'm optimistic for 2007 . " the dihk industry and trade chambers , which represents more than 3 million companies , said last week that german firms , including businesses in the chemical , engineering and automobile sectors , may create as many as 30,000 new jobs this year . germany most competitive economy in euro zone the flood of good economic news , a sharp departure from the gloom and self-doubt that has pervaded the country in recent years , received a further fillip this week with a survey published by business daily handelsblatt saying that germany is now regarded as the most competitive economy in the 13-nation euro single currency area . on a scale of 1 -lrb- very good -rrb- to 5 -lrb- very bad -rrb- , the survey of 1,175 european top executives gave germany an average grade of 2.5 , up from 2.8 , and only behind china -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- and switzerland -lrb- 2.4 -rrb- . part of germany 's perceived competitiveness in the survey was due to economic reforms pursued by chancellor angela merkel , according to the handelsblatt . " 56 percent of german executives are sure that the government led by merkel had improved the competitiveness of german companies , " the paper said . expert says no straying from reform path klaus mangold , federal commissioner for foreign investments , confirmed the survey 's findings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic prospects look rosy " the country has become more competitive , " mangold told daily saarbrücker zeitung .
he added that germany 's image abroad as a business destination had significantly improved and the moderate rise in wages in recent years had contributed to the fact that germany " is no longer a hugely expensive business location . " at the same time , mangold said , international investors now expect germany not to remain idle . " that applies particularly to the areas of taxation and non-wage labor costs , " mangold said , adding that the german government would now be judged on how seriously it pursued and implemented further reform . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .

" further delay in the release of this archive material would be unjust to holocaust survivors - virtually all of whom are now elderly - still seeking compensation for the unspeakable crimes of the nazi regime , " senator joseph biden , a member of the democratic party who takes over the senate committee thursday , wrote in a letter to british ambassador sir david manning . " we owe it to them as well as their relatives to act promptly , " he wrote . the letter echoed others sent to other countries on the commission that oversees the archive . dangerously deluded last spring , the 11-nation governing commission of the international red cross ' international tracing service , which oversees the archive in bad arolsen , agreed to provide greater access to the information contained in it .

" there might be the need for -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- forces to assist a political process -lrb- in somalia -rrb- , " he said .
" but sending forces without -lrb- having -rrb- that process would be a recipe for disaster . "

the country has stepped up its refugee screening because of the possible influx of islamist militia members . european members of the international somalia contact group include britain , italy , sweden and norway .
a top official from the eu commission , the bloc 's executive arm , also attended the meeting . the group was set up in june last year to support " peace and reconciliation " in somalia .
it also includes tanzania and the united states . bildt said that future talks of the group should not only focus on the situation in somalia but on ways how to stabilize the situation in the whole horn of africa . recent battles harsh the recent battles in somalia have been particularly harsh on the civilian population with thousands forced to flee their homes .

" further delay in the release of this archive material would be unjust to holocaust survivors - virtually all of whom are now elderly - still seeking compensation for the unspeakable crimes of the nazi regime , " senator joseph biden , a member of the democratic party who takes over the senate committee thursday , wrote in a letter to british ambassador sir david manning . " we owe it to them as well as their relatives to act promptly , " he wrote . the letter echoed others sent to other countries on the commission that oversees the archive . dangerously deluded last spring , the 11-nation governing commission of the international red cross ' international tracing service , which oversees the archive in bad arolsen , agreed to provide greater access to the information contained in it .
prior german concerns over privacy rights had kept the files closed for five decades . the ongoing delay is due to the member countries ' failing to ratify the agreement at home .
the agreement 's signatories are : germany , the us , israel , britain , france , luxembourg , greece , italy , belgium , poland and the netherlands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are still many family members unaccounted for us lawmakers said that the archive is also important to refuting the claims of holocaust deniers : " -lrb- the documents will provide -rrb- further proof , if any were still needed that those who deny the occurrence of the holocaust are dangerously deluded , " wrote biden . that issue resurged recently after iran held a much-criticized conference which debated whether the holocaust actually happened . a travesty other lawmakers added that access to the files is important for survivors and their families in regards to restitution and compensation issues as well as information about lost family members . lawyer sam dubbin , who represents holocaust survivors , told the associated press that such issues are often overlooked . " we know that so much information has been hidden , and there have been so many surprises when these nazi records are actually examined , " he said . " it would be a travesty to allow past restitution arrangements to stand until survivors and family members are given complete access to the entirety of the files .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 03.01.2007 " a deadly fusion of ideology and material interest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler , says historian götz aly , was a " people 's dictator " in 2005 , götz aly landed a bestseller with a study of how ordinary germans , in addition to bankers and industrialists , benefited under nazism .
now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.01.2007 buoyed by good news , german economy steams ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowhere is the german economic boom more evident than in the construction industry germany 's economic upswing got a further boost this week with news of a continuing fall in jobless numbers and a survey showing the country to be the most competitive of the 13 economies sharing the euro . german unemployment , the country 's biggest headache for over a decade , fell by a seasonally adjusted 108,000 in december to 4.12 million or 9.8 percent of the workforce , the nuremberg-based federal labor office said wednesday .
the ninth consecutive monthly decline , the december jobless rate is the lowest since august 2002 , from 10.1 percent . as one of the first key pieces of german economic data to be released in 2007 , the unemployment figures are likely to add to expectations that the strong economic momentum built up in the country last year will help to propel the world 's third-largest economy behind the united states and japan through the coming 12 months . mild weather and economic upturn labor office chief frank-jürgen weise pointed to germany 's unseasonably mild winter weather as helping to underpin the nation 's labor market .
last month was the warmest december in germany in 32 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been germany 's biggest headache " the decline in unemployment in december " is primarily due to the positive economic situation , but unusually mild weather has also played a role , " weise said wednesday . commerzbank ag economist matthias rubisch echoed weise 's comments .
" the positive tendency on the labor market is partly the result of the dynamic economic development and as a result is likely to continue in the coming months , " rubisch told news agency dpa . the upturn was evident during the buoyant christmas shopping season which delighted retailers even though higher sales were partly attributed to advance purchases to avoid the three-point hike in the vat -lrb- sales tax -rrb- to 19 percent at the start of 2007 . underlining the optimistic outlook for germany , one of the nation 's leading economic institutes , the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- on wednesday revised upwards its economic growth projections for the year . despite a slowing global economy and the vat hike , the diw expects the nation 's growth rate to come in at 1.7 per cent this year compared to a previous forecast of 1.4 per cent .
europe 's biggest economy should then accelerate to 2.5 per cent next year , the diw said .
germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation last year to post what the diw expects to be a 2.3 per cent growth rate in 2006 . companies announce hiring the declining unemployment suggests that europe 's largest economy may not be adversely affected by chancellor angela merkel 's three percentage-point increase in sales tax on jan .
1 . " we 're in a truly upbeat economic environment , " stefan bielmeier , a fixed-income strategist at deutsche bank ag told news agency bloomberg .
" companies have good reason to consider hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa plans to create 3,000 new jobs that 's exactly what some firms are doing . deutsche lufthansa ag , europe 's second-biggest airline , plans to create 3,000 new jobs in germany this year to meet growing demand in the region .
other german companies such as continental ag and adidas ag plan to raise spending and hire new staff as profits rise . herbert hainer , chief executive of adidas , the sporting goods maker , said last month that while the company was expanding the most in markets like russia and china , it was also growing in germany , where it plans to create about 100 jobs in 2007 . " the german economy is ready to take off , " axel heitmann , chief executive of lanxess , a chemical maker that plans to hire at least 100 new people and invest 4 percent of sales , told daily international herald tribune .
" besides an unchanged strength in exports , increasing capital investment and private consumption is contributing .
i 'm optimistic for 2007 . " the dihk industry and trade chambers , which represents more than 3 million companies , said last week that german firms , including businesses in the chemical , engineering and automobile sectors , may create as many as 30,000 new jobs this year . germany most competitive economy in euro zone the flood of good economic news , a sharp departure from the gloom and self-doubt that has pervaded the country in recent years , received a further fillip this week with a survey published by business daily handelsblatt saying that germany is now regarded as the most competitive economy in the 13-nation euro single currency area . on a scale of 1 -lrb- very good -rrb- to 5 -lrb- very bad -rrb- , the survey of 1,175 european top executives gave germany an average grade of 2.5 , up from 2.8 , and only behind china -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- and switzerland -lrb- 2.4 -rrb- . part of germany 's perceived competitiveness in the survey was due to economic reforms pursued by chancellor angela merkel , according to the handelsblatt . " 56 percent of german executives are sure that the government led by merkel had improved the competitiveness of german companies , " the paper said . expert says no straying from reform path klaus mangold , federal commissioner for foreign investments , confirmed the survey 's findings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic prospects look rosy " the country has become more competitive , " mangold told daily saarbrücker zeitung .
he added that germany 's image abroad as a business destination had significantly improved and the moderate rise in wages in recent years had contributed to the fact that germany " is no longer a hugely expensive business location . " at the same time , mangold said , international investors now expect germany not to remain idle .

he was going mad , he said , and offered to help the machine along with the use of some tools . after police warned the caller that any such action could constitute criminal damage , a resident later reported that someone had attacked the vending machine with a hammer . the nicotine-deprived smoker was nabbed shortly afterwards in the area , still without his cigarettes , and now faces charges of damaging property . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drunken cyclist 's fear of wife leads to police investigation a german cyclist who returned home late wednesday night battered and bruised , claiming he was mugged by a gang of youths , faces criminal charges and a cold shoulder after the true events of that evening were revealed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 03.01.2007 " a deadly fusion of ideology and material interest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler , says historian götz aly , was a " people 's dictator " in 2005 , götz aly landed a bestseller with a study of how ordinary germans , in addition to bankers and industrialists , benefited under nazism .
now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

" let us hope and pray that germany and its chancellor , ms. merkel , will at last get politicians to act , " geldof said in bild 's tuesday edition . geldof , who was the mastermind behind the 1985 live aid concert and the 2005 live 8 concerts to help africa , said the continent 's problems must be on the agenda when germany hosts g8 leaders at a summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm in june . financial concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geldof has long been an advocate for more help for africa geldof said he was aware that many germans are suffering from unemployment and have financial concerns , but said the country 's economy would grow in 2007 . however , " for -lrb- africans -rrb- , there will again be no economic boom , no food , no medicine and no education , " he said . irish rocker bono has also been courting germany to help africa .
he and german chancellor angela merkel exchanged a much-publicized embrace at the davos global economic summit a year ago . bono has urged wealthy nations in the past to grant debt relief to poorer nations . debate series planned according to the financial times -lrb- ft -rrb- , bono 's london-based campaign group called " data " plans to set up an office in berlin next month along with geldof . geldof 's coordinator in germany , jeremy gaines , told the newspaper that the two celebrity musicians want to work with german filmmakers and television broadcasters to draw attention to africa 's development needs . bildunterschrift : bono and geldof lobbied then chancellor schröder -lrb- m -rrb- in gleneagles geldof is also planning " intellectual aid " - a series of debates with german thinkers about africa , development and the role of western countries , the ft reported . the first " intellectual aid " debate is scheduled for march 22 , which is world water day . the second one is to be held in berlin during the g8 summit in heiligendamm to " monitor whether leaders are living up to their promises from gleneagles , " gaines said . promises and pledges geldof 's live 8 concerts were held just days before the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 - at which the group 's leaders pledged debt relief for poor african countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear whether us president bush -lrb- l -rrb- will get on the africa bandwagon they also pledged $ 50 billion in extra development aid by 2010 . germany has said it wants to set up a g8 program to encourage foreign investment as a reward to african nations who fight corruption and aids and who promote democracy . according to press reports , merkel 's cabinet has drafted a proposal that each member of the g8 sign a partnership agreement with an african state . some german development non-governmental organizations , however , are skeptical of bono and geldof 's work .

the paper quoted a spokesman for the state prosecutor in nuremberg as saying : " the prosecutor is investigating whether siemens contravened the law on foreign trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program was meant to help meet everyday needs of iraqis the spokesman said the allegations against siemens concerned mainly its energy and medical equipment operations and involved a six-figure sum .
the money was allegedly paid as a bribe to saddam hussein 's regime to secure contracts as part of the un-supervised food-for-oil program which ran from late 1996 to 2003 .
the program allowed the iraqi government to sell limited amounts of oil to purchase essential goods to alleviate the effects of sanctions on the civilian population .
similar accusations at linde in late december , state prosecutors in munich said they had opened an investigation into german oil giant linde , which faces similar accusations over the food-for-oil program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linde is also under investigation an investigation ordered by un secretary general kofi annan found in 2005 that more than 2,000 companies from 60 countries bribed saddam hussein 's government to be allowed to take part in the program .
a siemens spokesman told afx news : " we are cooperating with the public prosecutor .
but it is important to put this into context and realize that it is part of a wider investigation concerning several companies which took part in the oil-for-food program . "
other charges pending siemens is also facing an investigation by german prosecutors over alleged embezzlement , bribery and tax evasion .
some employees are suspected of collaborating in opening slush fund accounts abroad , which are used for making illicit payments , and of operating a system to embezzle company money .
seven former and current employees were arrested late last year but freed before christmas after they made statements to prosecutors . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens corruption scandal deepens although munich state prosecutors have freed a group of men accused of running slush funds at the engineering giant siemens , they announced on friday that the case was growing in strength .
-lrb- 22.12.2006 -rrb- germany considers tighter ceo laws the siemens bribery scandal has caused the german government to consider forbidding retired ceos from moving over to head their companies ' supervisory boards , according to a report released this week .

" there might be the need for -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- forces to assist a political process -lrb- in somalia -rrb- , " he said .
" but sending forces without -lrb- having -rrb- that process would be a recipe for disaster . "

the country has stepped up its refugee screening because of the possible influx of islamist militia members . european members of the international somalia contact group include britain , italy , sweden and norway .
a top official from the eu commission , the bloc 's executive arm , also attended the meeting . the group was set up in june last year to support " peace and reconciliation " in somalia .
it also includes tanzania and the united states . bildt said that future talks of the group should not only focus on the situation in somalia but on ways how to stabilize the situation in the whole horn of africa . recent battles harsh the recent battles in somalia have been particularly harsh on the civilian population with thousands forced to flee their homes .

but analysts say the continued presence of foreign troops could further weaken the regime . ethiopia earlier this week said it could not afford to keep its troops in neighbouring somalia much longer and called for the quick deployment of international peacekeepers . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves dr congo mission the german parliament officially approved the deployment of troops to take part in a european mission in dr congo during planned elections there .

the ninth consecutive monthly decline , the december jobless rate is the lowest since august 2002 , from 10.1 percent . as one of the first key pieces of german economic data to be released in 2007 , the unemployment figures are likely to add to expectations that the strong economic momentum built up in the country last year will help to propel the world 's third-largest economy behind the united states and japan through the coming 12 months . mild weather and economic upturn labor office chief frank-jürgen weise pointed to germany 's unseasonably mild winter weather as helping to underpin the nation 's labor market .
last month was the warmest december in germany in 32 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been germany 's biggest headache " the decline in unemployment in december " is primarily due to the positive economic situation , but unusually mild weather has also played a role , " weise said wednesday . commerzbank ag economist matthias rubisch echoed weise 's comments .
" the positive tendency on the labor market is partly the result of the dynamic economic development and as a result is likely to continue in the coming months , " rubisch told news agency dpa . the upturn was evident during the buoyant christmas shopping season which delighted retailers even though higher sales were partly attributed to advance purchases to avoid the three-point hike in the vat -lrb- sales tax -rrb- to 19 percent at the start of 2007 . underlining the optimistic outlook for germany , one of the nation 's leading economic institutes , the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- on wednesday revised upwards its economic growth projections for the year . despite a slowing global economy and the vat hike , the diw expects the nation 's growth rate to come in at 1.7 per cent this year compared to a previous forecast of 1.4 per cent .
europe 's biggest economy should then accelerate to 2.5 per cent next year , the diw said .
germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation last year to post what the diw expects to be a 2.3 per cent growth rate in 2006 . companies announce hiring the declining unemployment suggests that europe 's largest economy may not be adversely affected by chancellor angela merkel 's three percentage-point increase in sales tax on jan .

now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

" further delay in the release of this archive material would be unjust to holocaust survivors - virtually all of whom are now elderly - still seeking compensation for the unspeakable crimes of the nazi regime , " senator joseph biden , a member of the democratic party who takes over the senate committee thursday , wrote in a letter to british ambassador sir david manning . " we owe it to them as well as their relatives to act promptly , " he wrote . the letter echoed others sent to other countries on the commission that oversees the archive . dangerously deluded last spring , the 11-nation governing commission of the international red cross ' international tracing service , which oversees the archive in bad arolsen , agreed to provide greater access to the information contained in it .
prior german concerns over privacy rights had kept the files closed for five decades . the ongoing delay is due to the member countries ' failing to ratify the agreement at home .
the agreement 's signatories are : germany , the us , israel , britain , france , luxembourg , greece , italy , belgium , poland and the netherlands .

" we know that so much information has been hidden , and there have been so many surprises when these nazi records are actually examined , " he said .

the paper quoted a spokesman for the state prosecutor in nuremberg as saying : " the prosecutor is investigating whether siemens contravened the law on foreign trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program was meant to help meet everyday needs of iraqis the spokesman said the allegations against siemens concerned mainly its energy and medical equipment operations and involved a six-figure sum .
the money was allegedly paid as a bribe to saddam hussein 's regime to secure contracts as part of the un-supervised food-for-oil program which ran from late 1996 to 2003 .
the program allowed the iraqi government to sell limited amounts of oil to purchase essential goods to alleviate the effects of sanctions on the civilian population .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linde is also under investigation an investigation ordered by un secretary general kofi annan found in 2005 that more than 2,000 companies from 60 countries bribed saddam hussein 's government to be allowed to take part in the program .
a siemens spokesman told afx news : " we are cooperating with the public prosecutor .
but it is important to put this into context and realize that it is part of a wider investigation concerning several companies which took part in the oil-for-food program . "
other charges pending siemens is also facing an investigation by german prosecutors over alleged embezzlement , bribery and tax evasion .
some employees are suspected of collaborating in opening slush fund accounts abroad , which are used for making illicit payments , and of operating a system to embezzle company money .
seven former and current employees were arrested late last year but freed before christmas after they made statements to prosecutors . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens corruption scandal deepens although munich state prosecutors have freed a group of men accused of running slush funds at the engineering giant siemens , they announced on friday that the case was growing in strength .

" there might be the need for -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- forces to assist a political process -lrb- in somalia -rrb- , " he said .
" but sending forces without -lrb- having -rrb- that process would be a recipe for disaster . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called the meeting he also said that it was unclear who would finance a possible african-led peacekeeping mission in somalia . worried about kenya steinmeier also voiced concern over a spill-over of the conflict to neighbouring kenya .
the country has stepped up its refugee screening because of the possible influx of islamist militia members . european members of the international somalia contact group include britain , italy , sweden and norway .
a top official from the eu commission , the bloc 's executive arm , also attended the meeting . the group was set up in june last year to support " peace and reconciliation " in somalia .
it also includes tanzania and the united states . bildt said that future talks of the group should not only focus on the situation in somalia but on ways how to stabilize the situation in the whole horn of africa . recent battles harsh the recent battles in somalia have been particularly harsh on the civilian population with thousands forced to flee their homes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army has been on peacekeeping missions in congo and lebanon ethiopia , which backs somalia 's weak transitional government , launched an offensive on december 24 against the islamist movement which has controlled much of the country 's south since june 2006 . thousands of ethiopian troops gave somalia military enforcement in its war against the union of islamic courts -lrb- uic -rrb- , capturing most of the country and forcing a mass retreat and desertion of islamist fighters over the past few days . the fate of the country , which fell into anarchy after the 1991 ouster of dictator mohammed siad barre , hangs in the balance as ethiopian troops could leave as early as in two weeks , potentially creating a security vacuum . somalia 's interim government wants ethiopian troops to stay until a peacekeeping force is deployed .
but analysts say the continued presence of foreign troops could further weaken the regime . ethiopia earlier this week said it could not afford to keep its troops in neighbouring somalia much longer and called for the quick deployment of international peacekeepers . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves dr congo mission the german parliament officially approved the deployment of troops to take part in a european mission in dr congo during planned elections there .

the ninth consecutive monthly decline , the december jobless rate is the lowest since august 2002 , from 10.1 percent . as one of the first key pieces of german economic data to be released in 2007 , the unemployment figures are likely to add to expectations that the strong economic momentum built up in the country last year will help to propel the world 's third-largest economy behind the united states and japan through the coming 12 months . mild weather and economic upturn labor office chief frank-jürgen weise pointed to germany 's unseasonably mild winter weather as helping to underpin the nation 's labor market .
last month was the warmest december in germany in 32 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been germany 's biggest headache " the decline in unemployment in december " is primarily due to the positive economic situation , but unusually mild weather has also played a role , " weise said wednesday . commerzbank ag economist matthias rubisch echoed weise 's comments .
" the positive tendency on the labor market is partly the result of the dynamic economic development and as a result is likely to continue in the coming months , " rubisch told news agency dpa . the upturn was evident during the buoyant christmas shopping season which delighted retailers even though higher sales were partly attributed to advance purchases to avoid the three-point hike in the vat -lrb- sales tax -rrb- to 19 percent at the start of 2007 . underlining the optimistic outlook for germany , one of the nation 's leading economic institutes , the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- on wednesday revised upwards its economic growth projections for the year . despite a slowing global economy and the vat hike , the diw expects the nation 's growth rate to come in at 1.7 per cent this year compared to a previous forecast of 1.4 per cent .
europe 's biggest economy should then accelerate to 2.5 per cent next year , the diw said .
germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation last year to post what the diw expects to be a 2.3 per cent growth rate in 2006 . companies announce hiring the declining unemployment suggests that europe 's largest economy may not be adversely affected by chancellor angela merkel 's three percentage-point increase in sales tax on jan .

other german companies such as continental ag and adidas ag plan to raise spending and hire new staff as profits rise . herbert hainer , chief executive of adidas , the sporting goods maker , said last month that while the company was expanding the most in markets like russia and china , it was also growing in germany , where it plans to create about 100 jobs in 2007 . " the german economy is ready to take off , " axel heitmann , chief executive of lanxess , a chemical maker that plans to hire at least 100 new people and invest 4 percent of sales , told daily international herald tribune .

he added that germany 's image abroad as a business destination had significantly improved and the moderate rise in wages in recent years had contributed to the fact that germany " is no longer a hugely expensive business location .

" the positive tendency on the labor market is partly the result of the dynamic economic development and as a result is likely to continue in the coming months , " rubisch told news agency dpa . the upturn was evident during the buoyant christmas shopping season which delighted retailers even though higher sales were partly attributed to advance purchases to avoid the three-point hike in the vat -lrb- sales tax -rrb- to 19 percent at the start of 2007 . underlining the optimistic outlook for germany , one of the nation 's leading economic institutes , the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- on wednesday revised upwards its economic growth projections for the year . despite a slowing global economy and the vat hike , the diw expects the nation 's growth rate to come in at 1.7 per cent this year compared to a previous forecast of 1.4 per cent .
europe 's biggest economy should then accelerate to 2.5 per cent next year , the diw said .
germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation last year to post what the diw expects to be a 2.3 per cent growth rate in 2006 . companies announce hiring the declining unemployment suggests that europe 's largest economy may not be adversely affected by chancellor angela merkel 's three percentage-point increase in sales tax on jan .

other german companies such as continental ag and adidas ag plan to raise spending and hire new staff as profits rise . herbert hainer , chief executive of adidas , the sporting goods maker , said last month that while the company was expanding the most in markets like russia and china , it was also growing in germany , where it plans to create about 100 jobs in 2007 . " the german economy is ready to take off , " axel heitmann , chief executive of lanxess , a chemical maker that plans to hire at least 100 new people and invest 4 percent of sales , told daily international herald tribune .

" further delay in the release of this archive material would be unjust to holocaust survivors - virtually all of whom are now elderly - still seeking compensation for the unspeakable crimes of the nazi regime , " senator joseph biden , a member of the democratic party who takes over the senate committee thursday , wrote in a letter to british ambassador sir david manning . " we owe it to them as well as their relatives to act promptly , " he wrote . the letter echoed others sent to other countries on the commission that oversees the archive . dangerously deluded last spring , the 11-nation governing commission of the international red cross ' international tracing service , which oversees the archive in bad arolsen , agreed to provide greater access to the information contained in it .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program was meant to help meet everyday needs of iraqis the spokesman said the allegations against siemens concerned mainly its energy and medical equipment operations and involved a six-figure sum .
the money was allegedly paid as a bribe to saddam hussein 's regime to secure contracts as part of the un-supervised food-for-oil program which ran from late 1996 to 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 03.01.2007 " a deadly fusion of ideology and material interest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler , says historian götz aly , was a " people 's dictator " in 2005 , götz aly landed a bestseller with a study of how ordinary germans , in addition to bankers and industrialists , benefited under nazism .
now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

" there might be the need for -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- forces to assist a political process -lrb- in somalia -rrb- , " he said .
" but sending forces without -lrb- having -rrb- that process would be a recipe for disaster . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier called the meeting he also said that it was unclear who would finance a possible african-led peacekeeping mission in somalia . worried about kenya steinmeier also voiced concern over a spill-over of the conflict to neighbouring kenya .
the country has stepped up its refugee screening because of the possible influx of islamist militia members . european members of the international somalia contact group include britain , italy , sweden and norway .
a top official from the eu commission , the bloc 's executive arm , also attended the meeting . the group was set up in june last year to support " peace and reconciliation " in somalia .
it also includes tanzania and the united states . bildt said that future talks of the group should not only focus on the situation in somalia but on ways how to stabilize the situation in the whole horn of africa . recent battles harsh the recent battles in somalia have been particularly harsh on the civilian population with thousands forced to flee their homes .

but analysts say the continued presence of foreign troops could further weaken the regime . ethiopia earlier this week said it could not afford to keep its troops in neighbouring somalia much longer and called for the quick deployment of international peacekeepers . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves dr congo mission the german parliament officially approved the deployment of troops to take part in a european mission in dr congo during planned elections there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 03.01.2007 " a deadly fusion of ideology and material interest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler , says historian götz aly , was a " people 's dictator " in 2005 , götz aly landed a bestseller with a study of how ordinary germans , in addition to bankers and industrialists , benefited under nazism .
now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

4 for talks with us president george w. bush that are expected to touch upon the middle east , afghanistan , iraq , iran and kosovo . the relationship between germany and the united states hit a low when merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , strongly opposed the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
but since merkel 's time in office , transatlantic ties have warmed considerably . " we want to talk about ever-closer economic cooperation .
our economic systems are based on the same values , " she told the financial times newspaper .
" we should be looking for ways to keep developing these together at a transatlantic level . " we must watch out that we do not drift apart but instead come closer together , where there are clear advantages for both sides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 03.01.2007 " a deadly fusion of ideology and material interest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler , says historian götz aly , was a " people 's dictator " in 2005 , götz aly landed a bestseller with a study of how ordinary germans , in addition to bankers and industrialists , benefited under nazism .
now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

" further delay in the release of this archive material would be unjust to holocaust survivors - virtually all of whom are now elderly - still seeking compensation for the unspeakable crimes of the nazi regime , " senator joseph biden , a member of the democratic party who takes over the senate committee thursday , wrote in a letter to british ambassador sir david manning . " we owe it to them as well as their relatives to act promptly , " he wrote . the letter echoed others sent to other countries on the commission that oversees the archive . dangerously deluded last spring , the 11-nation governing commission of the international red cross ' international tracing service , which oversees the archive in bad arolsen , agreed to provide greater access to the information contained in it .
prior german concerns over privacy rights had kept the files closed for five decades . the ongoing delay is due to the member countries ' failing to ratify the agreement at home .
the agreement 's signatories are : germany , the us , israel , britain , france , luxembourg , greece , italy , belgium , poland and the netherlands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are still many family members unaccounted for us lawmakers said that the archive is also important to refuting the claims of holocaust deniers : " -lrb- the documents will provide -rrb- further proof , if any were still needed that those who deny the occurrence of the holocaust are dangerously deluded , " wrote biden . that issue resurged recently after iran held a much-criticized conference which debated whether the holocaust actually happened . a travesty other lawmakers added that access to the files is important for survivors and their families in regards to restitution and compensation issues as well as information about lost family members . lawyer sam dubbin , who represents holocaust survivors , told the associated press that such issues are often overlooked . " we know that so much information has been hidden , and there have been so many surprises when these nazi records are actually examined , " he said .

the ninth consecutive monthly decline , the december jobless rate is the lowest since august 2002 , from 10.1 percent . as one of the first key pieces of german economic data to be released in 2007 , the unemployment figures are likely to add to expectations that the strong economic momentum built up in the country last year will help to propel the world 's third-largest economy behind the united states and japan through the coming 12 months . mild weather and economic upturn labor office chief frank-jürgen weise pointed to germany 's unseasonably mild winter weather as helping to underpin the nation 's labor market .
last month was the warmest december in germany in 32 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been germany 's biggest headache " the decline in unemployment in december " is primarily due to the positive economic situation , but unusually mild weather has also played a role , " weise said wednesday . commerzbank ag economist matthias rubisch echoed weise 's comments .
" the positive tendency on the labor market is partly the result of the dynamic economic development and as a result is likely to continue in the coming months , " rubisch told news agency dpa . the upturn was evident during the buoyant christmas shopping season which delighted retailers even though higher sales were partly attributed to advance purchases to avoid the three-point hike in the vat -lrb- sales tax -rrb- to 19 percent at the start of 2007 . underlining the optimistic outlook for germany , one of the nation 's leading economic institutes , the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- on wednesday revised upwards its economic growth projections for the year . despite a slowing global economy and the vat hike , the diw expects the nation 's growth rate to come in at 1.7 per cent this year compared to a previous forecast of 1.4 per cent .
europe 's biggest economy should then accelerate to 2.5 per cent next year , the diw said .
germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation last year to post what the diw expects to be a 2.3 per cent growth rate in 2006 . companies announce hiring the declining unemployment suggests that europe 's largest economy may not be adversely affected by chancellor angela merkel 's three percentage-point increase in sales tax on jan .

other german companies such as continental ag and adidas ag plan to raise spending and hire new staff as profits rise . herbert hainer , chief executive of adidas , the sporting goods maker , said last month that while the company was expanding the most in markets like russia and china , it was also growing in germany , where it plans to create about 100 jobs in 2007 . " the german economy is ready to take off , " axel heitmann , chief executive of lanxess , a chemical maker that plans to hire at least 100 new people and invest 4 percent of sales , told daily international herald tribune .
" besides an unchanged strength in exports , increasing capital investment and private consumption is contributing .
i 'm optimistic for 2007 . " the dihk industry and trade chambers , which represents more than 3 million companies , said last week that german firms , including businesses in the chemical , engineering and automobile sectors , may create as many as 30,000 new jobs this year . germany most competitive economy in euro zone the flood of good economic news , a sharp departure from the gloom and self-doubt that has pervaded the country in recent years , received a further fillip this week with a survey published by business daily handelsblatt saying that germany is now regarded as the most competitive economy in the 13-nation euro single currency area . on a scale of 1 -lrb- very good -rrb- to 5 -lrb- very bad -rrb- , the survey of 1,175 european top executives gave germany an average grade of 2.5 , up from 2.8 , and only behind china -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- and switzerland -lrb- 2.4 -rrb- . part of germany 's perceived competitiveness in the survey was due to economic reforms pursued by chancellor angela merkel , according to the handelsblatt . " 56 percent of german executives are sure that the government led by merkel had improved the competitiveness of german companies , " the paper said . expert says no straying from reform path klaus mangold , federal commissioner for foreign investments , confirmed the survey 's findings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic prospects look rosy " the country has become more competitive , " mangold told daily saarbrücker zeitung .
he added that germany 's image abroad as a business destination had significantly improved and the moderate rise in wages in recent years had contributed to the fact that germany " is no longer a hugely expensive business location . " at the same time , mangold said , international investors now expect germany not to remain idle . " that applies particularly to the areas of taxation and non-wage labor costs , " mangold said , adding that the german government would now be judged on how seriously it pursued and implemented further reform . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .

the ninth consecutive monthly decline , the december jobless rate is the lowest since august 2002 , from 10.1 percent . as one of the first key pieces of german economic data to be released in 2007 , the unemployment figures are likely to add to expectations that the strong economic momentum built up in the country last year will help to propel the world 's third-largest economy behind the united states and japan through the coming 12 months . mild weather and economic upturn labor office chief frank-jürgen weise pointed to germany 's unseasonably mild winter weather as helping to underpin the nation 's labor market .
last month was the warmest december in germany in 32 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been germany 's biggest headache " the decline in unemployment in december " is primarily due to the positive economic situation , but unusually mild weather has also played a role , " weise said wednesday . commerzbank ag economist matthias rubisch echoed weise 's comments .
" the positive tendency on the labor market is partly the result of the dynamic economic development and as a result is likely to continue in the coming months , " rubisch told news agency dpa . the upturn was evident during the buoyant christmas shopping season which delighted retailers even though higher sales were partly attributed to advance purchases to avoid the three-point hike in the vat -lrb- sales tax -rrb- to 19 percent at the start of 2007 . underlining the optimistic outlook for germany , one of the nation 's leading economic institutes , the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- on wednesday revised upwards its economic growth projections for the year . despite a slowing global economy and the vat hike , the diw expects the nation 's growth rate to come in at 1.7 per cent this year compared to a previous forecast of 1.4 per cent .
europe 's biggest economy should then accelerate to 2.5 per cent next year , the diw said .
germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation last year to post what the diw expects to be a 2.3 per cent growth rate in 2006 . companies announce hiring the declining unemployment suggests that europe 's largest economy may not be adversely affected by chancellor angela merkel 's three percentage-point increase in sales tax on jan .
1 . " we 're in a truly upbeat economic environment , " stefan bielmeier , a fixed-income strategist at deutsche bank ag told news agency bloomberg .
" companies have good reason to consider hiring .

other german companies such as continental ag and adidas ag plan to raise spending and hire new staff as profits rise . herbert hainer , chief executive of adidas , the sporting goods maker , said last month that while the company was expanding the most in markets like russia and china , it was also growing in germany , where it plans to create about 100 jobs in 2007 . " the german economy is ready to take off , " axel heitmann , chief executive of lanxess , a chemical maker that plans to hire at least 100 new people and invest 4 percent of sales , told daily international herald tribune .

" there might be the need for -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- forces to assist a political process -lrb- in somalia -rrb- , " he said .
" but sending forces without -lrb- having -rrb- that process would be a recipe for disaster . "

the country has stepped up its refugee screening because of the possible influx of islamist militia members . european members of the international somalia contact group include britain , italy , sweden and norway .
a top official from the eu commission , the bloc 's executive arm , also attended the meeting . the group was set up in june last year to support " peace and reconciliation " in somalia .
it also includes tanzania and the united states . bildt said that future talks of the group should not only focus on the situation in somalia but on ways how to stabilize the situation in the whole horn of africa . recent battles harsh the recent battles in somalia have been particularly harsh on the civilian population with thousands forced to flee their homes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 03.01.2007 " a deadly fusion of ideology and material interest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler , says historian götz aly , was a " people 's dictator " in 2005 , götz aly landed a bestseller with a study of how ordinary germans , in addition to bankers and industrialists , benefited under nazism .
now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 03.01.2007 " a deadly fusion of ideology and material interest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler , says historian götz aly , was a " people 's dictator " in 2005 , götz aly landed a bestseller with a study of how ordinary germans , in addition to bankers and industrialists , benefited under nazism .
now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .
götz aly was interviewed by jefferson chase , who also translated the book " hitler 's beneficiaries " into english . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is good and evil in every nation " john rabe , a german businessman saved thousands of chinese from japanese soldiers during wwii .

now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 03.01.2007 " a deadly fusion of ideology and material interest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler , says historian götz aly , was a " people 's dictator " in 2005 , götz aly landed a bestseller with a study of how ordinary germans , in addition to bankers and industrialists , benefited under nazism .
now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 03.01.2007 " a deadly fusion of ideology and material interest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler , says historian götz aly , was a " people 's dictator " in 2005 , götz aly landed a bestseller with a study of how ordinary germans , in addition to bankers and industrialists , benefited under nazism .
now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.01.2007 buoyed by good news , german economy steams ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowhere is the german economic boom more evident than in the construction industry germany 's economic upswing got a further boost this week with news of a continuing fall in jobless numbers and a survey showing the country to be the most competitive of the 13 economies sharing the euro . german unemployment , the country 's biggest headache for over a decade , fell by a seasonally adjusted 108,000 in december to 4.12 million or 9.8 percent of the workforce , the nuremberg-based federal labor office said wednesday .
the ninth consecutive monthly decline , the december jobless rate is the lowest since august 2002 , from 10.1 percent . as one of the first key pieces of german economic data to be released in 2007 , the unemployment figures are likely to add to expectations that the strong economic momentum built up in the country last year will help to propel the world 's third-largest economy behind the united states and japan through the coming 12 months . mild weather and economic upturn labor office chief frank-jürgen weise pointed to germany 's unseasonably mild winter weather as helping to underpin the nation 's labor market .
last month was the warmest december in germany in 32 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been germany 's biggest headache " the decline in unemployment in december " is primarily due to the positive economic situation , but unusually mild weather has also played a role , " weise said wednesday . commerzbank ag economist matthias rubisch echoed weise 's comments .
" the positive tendency on the labor market is partly the result of the dynamic economic development and as a result is likely to continue in the coming months , " rubisch told news agency dpa . the upturn was evident during the buoyant christmas shopping season which delighted retailers even though higher sales were partly attributed to advance purchases to avoid the three-point hike in the vat -lrb- sales tax -rrb- to 19 percent at the start of 2007 . underlining the optimistic outlook for germany , one of the nation 's leading economic institutes , the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- on wednesday revised upwards its economic growth projections for the year . despite a slowing global economy and the vat hike , the diw expects the nation 's growth rate to come in at 1.7 per cent this year compared to a previous forecast of 1.4 per cent .
europe 's biggest economy should then accelerate to 2.5 per cent next year , the diw said .
germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation last year to post what the diw expects to be a 2.3 per cent growth rate in 2006 . companies announce hiring the declining unemployment suggests that europe 's largest economy may not be adversely affected by chancellor angela merkel 's three percentage-point increase in sales tax on jan .
1 . " we 're in a truly upbeat economic environment , " stefan bielmeier , a fixed-income strategist at deutsche bank ag told news agency bloomberg .
" companies have good reason to consider hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa plans to create 3,000 new jobs that 's exactly what some firms are doing . deutsche lufthansa ag , europe 's second-biggest airline , plans to create 3,000 new jobs in germany this year to meet growing demand in the region .
other german companies such as continental ag and adidas ag plan to raise spending and hire new staff as profits rise . herbert hainer , chief executive of adidas , the sporting goods maker , said last month that while the company was expanding the most in markets like russia and china , it was also growing in germany , where it plans to create about 100 jobs in 2007 . " the german economy is ready to take off , " axel heitmann , chief executive of lanxess , a chemical maker that plans to hire at least 100 new people and invest 4 percent of sales , told daily international herald tribune .
" besides an unchanged strength in exports , increasing capital investment and private consumption is contributing .
i 'm optimistic for 2007 . " the dihk industry and trade chambers , which represents more than 3 million companies , said last week that german firms , including businesses in the chemical , engineering and automobile sectors , may create as many as 30,000 new jobs this year . germany most competitive economy in euro zone the flood of good economic news , a sharp departure from the gloom and self-doubt that has pervaded the country in recent years , received a further fillip this week with a survey published by business daily handelsblatt saying that germany is now regarded as the most competitive economy in the 13-nation euro single currency area . on a scale of 1 -lrb- very good -rrb- to 5 -lrb- very bad -rrb- , the survey of 1,175 european top executives gave germany an average grade of 2.5 , up from 2.8 , and only behind china -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- and switzerland -lrb- 2.4 -rrb- . part of germany 's perceived competitiveness in the survey was due to economic reforms pursued by chancellor angela merkel , according to the handelsblatt . " 56 percent of german executives are sure that the government led by merkel had improved the competitiveness of german companies , " the paper said . expert says no straying from reform path klaus mangold , federal commissioner for foreign investments , confirmed the survey 's findings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic prospects look rosy " the country has become more competitive , " mangold told daily saarbrücker zeitung .
he added that germany 's image abroad as a business destination had significantly improved and the moderate rise in wages in recent years had contributed to the fact that germany " is no longer a hugely expensive business location . " at the same time , mangold said , international investors now expect germany not to remain idle . " that applies particularly to the areas of taxation and non-wage labor costs , " mangold said , adding that the german government would now be judged on how seriously it pursued and implemented further reform . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .

the ninth consecutive monthly decline , the december jobless rate is the lowest since august 2002 , from 10.1 percent . as one of the first key pieces of german economic data to be released in 2007 , the unemployment figures are likely to add to expectations that the strong economic momentum built up in the country last year will help to propel the world 's third-largest economy behind the united states and japan through the coming 12 months . mild weather and economic upturn labor office chief frank-jürgen weise pointed to germany 's unseasonably mild winter weather as helping to underpin the nation 's labor market .
last month was the warmest december in germany in 32 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been germany 's biggest headache " the decline in unemployment in december " is primarily due to the positive economic situation , but unusually mild weather has also played a role , " weise said wednesday . commerzbank ag economist matthias rubisch echoed weise 's comments .
" the positive tendency on the labor market is partly the result of the dynamic economic development and as a result is likely to continue in the coming months , " rubisch told news agency dpa . the upturn was evident during the buoyant christmas shopping season which delighted retailers even though higher sales were partly attributed to advance purchases to avoid the three-point hike in the vat -lrb- sales tax -rrb- to 19 percent at the start of 2007 . underlining the optimistic outlook for germany , one of the nation 's leading economic institutes , the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- on wednesday revised upwards its economic growth projections for the year . despite a slowing global economy and the vat hike , the diw expects the nation 's growth rate to come in at 1.7 per cent this year compared to a previous forecast of 1.4 per cent .
europe 's biggest economy should then accelerate to 2.5 per cent next year , the diw said .
germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation last year to post what the diw expects to be a 2.3 per cent growth rate in 2006 . companies announce hiring the declining unemployment suggests that europe 's largest economy may not be adversely affected by chancellor angela merkel 's three percentage-point increase in sales tax on jan .

other german companies such as continental ag and adidas ag plan to raise spending and hire new staff as profits rise . herbert hainer , chief executive of adidas , the sporting goods maker , said last month that while the company was expanding the most in markets like russia and china , it was also growing in germany , where it plans to create about 100 jobs in 2007 . " the german economy is ready to take off , " axel heitmann , chief executive of lanxess , a chemical maker that plans to hire at least 100 new people and invest 4 percent of sales , told daily international herald tribune .
" besides an unchanged strength in exports , increasing capital investment and private consumption is contributing .

he added that germany 's image abroad as a business destination had significantly improved and the moderate rise in wages in recent years had contributed to the fact that germany " is no longer a hugely expensive business location . " at the same time , mangold said , international investors now expect germany not to remain idle .

the ninth consecutive monthly decline , the december jobless rate is the lowest since august 2002 , from 10.1 percent . as one of the first key pieces of german economic data to be released in 2007 , the unemployment figures are likely to add to expectations that the strong economic momentum built up in the country last year will help to propel the world 's third-largest economy behind the united states and japan through the coming 12 months . mild weather and economic upturn labor office chief frank-jürgen weise pointed to germany 's unseasonably mild winter weather as helping to underpin the nation 's labor market .
last month was the warmest december in germany in 32 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been germany 's biggest headache " the decline in unemployment in december " is primarily due to the positive economic situation , but unusually mild weather has also played a role , " weise said wednesday . commerzbank ag economist matthias rubisch echoed weise 's comments .
" the positive tendency on the labor market is partly the result of the dynamic economic development and as a result is likely to continue in the coming months , " rubisch told news agency dpa . the upturn was evident during the buoyant christmas shopping season which delighted retailers even though higher sales were partly attributed to advance purchases to avoid the three-point hike in the vat -lrb- sales tax -rrb- to 19 percent at the start of 2007 . underlining the optimistic outlook for germany , one of the nation 's leading economic institutes , the berlin-based german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- on wednesday revised upwards its economic growth projections for the year . despite a slowing global economy and the vat hike , the diw expects the nation 's growth rate to come in at 1.7 per cent this year compared to a previous forecast of 1.4 per cent .
europe 's biggest economy should then accelerate to 2.5 per cent next year , the diw said .
germany emerged from a protracted period of stagnation last year to post what the diw expects to be a 2.3 per cent growth rate in 2006 . companies announce hiring the declining unemployment suggests that europe 's largest economy may not be adversely affected by chancellor angela merkel 's three percentage-point increase in sales tax on jan .
1 . " we 're in a truly upbeat economic environment , " stefan bielmeier , a fixed-income strategist at deutsche bank ag told news agency bloomberg .
" companies have good reason to consider hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa plans to create 3,000 new jobs that 's exactly what some firms are doing . deutsche lufthansa ag , europe 's second-biggest airline , plans to create 3,000 new jobs in germany this year to meet growing demand in the region .
other german companies such as continental ag and adidas ag plan to raise spending and hire new staff as profits rise . herbert hainer , chief executive of adidas , the sporting goods maker , said last month that while the company was expanding the most in markets like russia and china , it was also growing in germany , where it plans to create about 100 jobs in 2007 . " the german economy is ready to take off , " axel heitmann , chief executive of lanxess , a chemical maker that plans to hire at least 100 new people and invest 4 percent of sales , told daily international herald tribune .
" besides an unchanged strength in exports , increasing capital investment and private consumption is contributing .

but coach joachim löw is full of plans for 2007 . after a mammoth program of 18 international matches last year , the third-placed team from the world cup will be taking things slightly easier this year - playing just 12 games . but germany coach joachim löw is still going into the new year full of plans .
" there will be several main areas of focus .
the most important is the qualification for the 2008 european championships , " the 46-year-old said . after the unforgettable experience of playing in the world cup at home in june and july , 2007 is to be a year of continuity , building on the last year 's positive results of 14 victories and just two defeats . fielding young blood löw , who replaced jürgen klinsmann as german national team coach after the world cup last year , is also looking towards continuing playing offensive soccer and integrating talented youngsters . " we will continue working towards playing attractive football and dominating our matches , " he said .
" we want to play successful and attractive football .
we owe it to our fans to give them good games . " löw is banking on established players like world cup stars michael ballack or miroslav klose or youngsters such as bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski or per mertesacker . he also wants to introduce newer faces like stuttgart 's mario gomez , stefan kiessling and gonzalo castro from bayer leverkusen or borussia mönhengladbach 's eugen polanski . " we need to make sure that we find a challenge for players like podolski , schweinsteiger and philip lahm , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez , who plays for stuttgart , has taken the bundesliga by storm gomez , who has taken the bundesliga by storm this season , could already receive his first cap on february 7 , when germany faces switzerland .
as striker lukas podolski will be suspended for the game , gomez could well play against the 2008 euro co-hosts . " we do not just want to see the first and second choice players , we also want to see third and fourth choice players , ' löw 's assistant hans-dieter flick said . löw wants to look at fringe players in january with a future invitation depending on the progress in the euro qualifiers . germany currently heads their group with 10 points and löw is happy that the team managed such a good start to their campaign .
" we took our world cup form into the european qualifiers , " he said . germany will be facing the czech republic in a top-of-the-table clash in prague on march 24 and then face san marino and slovakia at home and with the top two teams from each group advancing to the finals in austria and switzerland löw is hoping to have secured qualification well ahead of the final matches later in the year . gearing up for challenge for löw , who spent two years as assistant to jürgen klinsmann , the new job is not only challenging , but also enjoyable .
" i am really enjoying the job .
i have a lot of fun and a lot of passion , " the 46-year-old said . although he has enjoyed the best-ever start for a german national coach with five victories and one draw , löw is not looking towards resting on his laurels . " the team is not yet fully developed .

now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

" we know that so much information has been hidden , and there have been so many surprises when these nazi records are actually examined , " he said .

now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

" further delay in the release of this archive material would be unjust to holocaust survivors - virtually all of whom are now elderly - still seeking compensation for the unspeakable crimes of the nazi regime , " senator joseph biden , a member of the democratic party who takes over the senate committee thursday , wrote in a letter to british ambassador sir david manning . " we owe it to them as well as their relatives to act promptly , " he wrote . the letter echoed others sent to other countries on the commission that oversees the archive . dangerously deluded last spring , the 11-nation governing commission of the international red cross ' international tracing service , which oversees the archive in bad arolsen , agreed to provide greater access to the information contained in it .
prior german concerns over privacy rights had kept the files closed for five decades . the ongoing delay is due to the member countries ' failing to ratify the agreement at home .
the agreement 's signatories are : germany , the us , israel , britain , france , luxembourg , greece , italy , belgium , poland and the netherlands .

" we know that so much information has been hidden , and there have been so many surprises when these nazi records are actually examined , " he said .

" further delay in the release of this archive material would be unjust to holocaust survivors - virtually all of whom are now elderly - still seeking compensation for the unspeakable crimes of the nazi regime , " senator joseph biden , a member of the democratic party who takes over the senate committee thursday , wrote in a letter to british ambassador sir david manning . " we owe it to them as well as their relatives to act promptly , " he wrote . the letter echoed others sent to other countries on the commission that oversees the archive . dangerously deluded last spring , the 11-nation governing commission of the international red cross ' international tracing service , which oversees the archive in bad arolsen , agreed to provide greater access to the information contained in it .
prior german concerns over privacy rights had kept the files closed for five decades . the ongoing delay is due to the member countries ' failing to ratify the agreement at home .

" we know that so much information has been hidden , and there have been so many surprises when these nazi records are actually examined , " he said . " it would be a travesty to allow past restitution arrangements to stand until survivors and family members are given complete access to the entirety of the files .

" there might be the need for -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- forces to assist a political process -lrb- in somalia -rrb- , " he said .
" but sending forces without -lrb- having -rrb- that process would be a recipe for disaster . "

a top official from the eu commission , the bloc 's executive arm , also attended the meeting . the group was set up in june last year to support " peace and reconciliation " in somalia .
it also includes tanzania and the united states . bildt said that future talks of the group should not only focus on the situation in somalia but on ways how to stabilize the situation in the whole horn of africa . recent battles harsh the recent battles in somalia have been particularly harsh on the civilian population with thousands forced to flee their homes .

but since merkel 's time in office , transatlantic ties have warmed considerably . " we want to talk about ever-closer economic cooperation .
our economic systems are based on the same values , " she told the financial times newspaper .

the paper quoted a spokesman for the state prosecutor in nuremberg as saying : " the prosecutor is investigating whether siemens contravened the law on foreign trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program was meant to help meet everyday needs of iraqis the spokesman said the allegations against siemens concerned mainly its energy and medical equipment operations and involved a six-figure sum .
the money was allegedly paid as a bribe to saddam hussein 's regime to secure contracts as part of the un-supervised food-for-oil program which ran from late 1996 to 2003 .
the program allowed the iraqi government to sell limited amounts of oil to purchase essential goods to alleviate the effects of sanctions on the civilian population .
similar accusations at linde in late december , state prosecutors in munich said they had opened an investigation into german oil giant linde , which faces similar accusations over the food-for-oil program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linde is also under investigation an investigation ordered by un secretary general kofi annan found in 2005 that more than 2,000 companies from 60 countries bribed saddam hussein 's government to be allowed to take part in the program .
a siemens spokesman told afx news : " we are cooperating with the public prosecutor .
but it is important to put this into context and realize that it is part of a wider investigation concerning several companies which took part in the oil-for-food program . "
other charges pending siemens is also facing an investigation by german prosecutors over alleged embezzlement , bribery and tax evasion .
some employees are suspected of collaborating in opening slush fund accounts abroad , which are used for making illicit payments , and of operating a system to embezzle company money .

the paper quoted a spokesman for the state prosecutor in nuremberg as saying : " the prosecutor is investigating whether siemens contravened the law on foreign trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program was meant to help meet everyday needs of iraqis the spokesman said the allegations against siemens concerned mainly its energy and medical equipment operations and involved a six-figure sum .
the money was allegedly paid as a bribe to saddam hussein 's regime to secure contracts as part of the un-supervised food-for-oil program which ran from late 1996 to 2003 .
the program allowed the iraqi government to sell limited amounts of oil to purchase essential goods to alleviate the effects of sanctions on the civilian population .
similar accusations at linde in late december , state prosecutors in munich said they had opened an investigation into german oil giant linde , which faces similar accusations over the food-for-oil program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linde is also under investigation an investigation ordered by un secretary general kofi annan found in 2005 that more than 2,000 companies from 60 countries bribed saddam hussein 's government to be allowed to take part in the program .
a siemens spokesman told afx news : " we are cooperating with the public prosecutor .
but it is important to put this into context and realize that it is part of a wider investigation concerning several companies which took part in the oil-for-food program . "
other charges pending siemens is also facing an investigation by german prosecutors over alleged embezzlement , bribery and tax evasion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 03.01.2007 " a deadly fusion of ideology and material interest " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler , says historian götz aly , was a " people 's dictator " in 2005 , götz aly landed a bestseller with a study of how ordinary germans , in addition to bankers and industrialists , benefited under nazism .
now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .
i hope that the english version of the book will help us get beyond the idea that evil can be reduced to the deeds of isolated individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops confiscated huge amounts of goods from occupied countries like denmark what are your next projects ? i ’ ve just completed two short books .
one is a demoscopic study of the public mood in the third reich based on empirical indices such as how many germans opened up long-term savings accounts or named their children adolf .
the other is a book i wrote with a colleague of mine about a jewish family , the fromms , and in particular julius fromm , who was the inventor of the world ’ s first brand-name condom .
it ’ s an interesting story .
back then , condoms were only sold under the counter .
people would pass the drug store owner notes requesting “ hygienic articles . ” i accidentally stumbled across fromm ’ s story while researching the aryanization of jewish property in the third reich .
i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .
and here comes a jewish immigrant from russia who experimented with various types of rubber in berlin courtyards and who worked his way up from poverty to success .
his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

it ’ s an interesting story .

i was invited to give a talk in a gay club , and they told me they didn ’ t want any “ boring hetero stuff . ”
and so i decided to offer them something about how the nazis seized the most famous condom factory in the world from a jewish entrepreneur .
it ’ s a fascinating tale .
before fromm , condoms were stitched together and were as thick as bicycle tires .

his factory was personally confiscated by göring , who gave it to his godmother , but there were lots of germans who profited from fromm .
i think it ’ s a good little book about the rise and fall of an assimilated jewish family from eastern europe that has a lot to say about the culture of national socialism and the twentieth century in general .

now his book is available in english as " hitler ’ s beneficiaries . " dw-world.de : the german original of your book , hitlers volksstaat , caused a lot of discussion when it was published two years ago .
could you briefly summarize what it is about ? götz aly : my book describes one aspect of national socialism , namely the state ’ s generous social programs .
it tries to answer the question of why most germans were basically content under hitler .
the explanation is quite simple : hitler pursued a massive wealth-redistribution program to the benefit of ordinary people .
he spared them any of the burdens of world war ii by racking up enormous debts and by initiating campaigns of murderous plunder that cost millions of other people their lives .
that was his strategy , and it worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz aly is one of germany 's most iconoclastic historians how did you get the idea for the book ? i ’ ve been interested in the social policies of the third reich for 25 years , but the negotiations and debates -lsb- during the 1990s -rsb- between the jewish claims conference and the german government about compensation for forced laborers provided an additional impetus .
as important as they were , those talks could have given people the impression that the main profiteers from nazism were swiss bankers and german industrialists .
ordinary germans didn ’ t seem to play a role .
i knew that wasn ’ t true .
so i wrote an op-ed piece for the berliner zeitung newspaper , pointing out that all germans directly profited from forced laborers insofar as those laborers ’ nominal wages were taxed and the proceeds paid into the state budget .
i suggested that , to be fair , german pensioners should forego two percent of their pensions over the span of three years and pay the money into the compensation fund . if you write something like that , the next day you ’ ve got an angry german populace standing on your doorstep .
that ’ s when i knew that i was on to something big .
when you read the book , you understand a bit better what was going on in the minds of people back then , people who supported the most murderous political system of the twentieth century .
you recognize them as people who are like us . some left-wing readers felt you were attacking the german social welfare system .
is it a polemic book ? i don ’ t want to criticize the social welfare state .
i believe it ’ s one of the major european achievements of the twentieth century .
but when we talk about our social welfare state , we always pretend that the twelve years of national socialism never happened .
a great many of today ’ s laws originated in this period , whether we ’ re talking about legislation protecting the rights of workers and tenants , holiday and overtime pay , or state health insurance for pensioners .
that doesn ’ t mean such things are wrong , but we should n't pretend that they were achieved by german workers at the barricades .
we should be historically honest .
and then perhaps we ’ ll understand the enormous power the totalitarian regime had to unite people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers and prisoners were worked to death to provide for the reich critics said that you devoted too much attention to statistics and downplayed the importance of anti-semitism .
what role did ideology play in hitler ’ s popularity ? this is not a book about the holocaust per se .
it concentrates on how nazi germany financed world war ii and bribed ordinary germans into supporting it .
it ’ s not about how germans became anti-semites or whether they already were anti-semitic .
i didn ’ t choose to pose those questions because i think it oversimplifies the situation to reduce the crime of the holocaust to german anti-semitism .
it ’ s not that anti-semitism didn ’ t play a role .
but the question is : what role ?
this has been the subject of much investigation , and it should continue to be investigated , but i reject the idea that anti-semitism was the sole motivation that drove the holocaust .
for the holocaust to happen , there had to be a fusion between the nazis ’ anti-jewish world view , which degraded most people to inferior status while elevating ordinary germans into master race , and concrete material interests and advantages .
the two aspects are equally important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's policies meant german housewives were relatively well-off you worked for many years as a journalist and do n't have a permanent academic post .
does that make you different in your approach from historians with more conventional backgrounds ? even as a child , i wanted to be a historian .
but i got off track because of the revolutionary spirit of the late 1960s .
we wanted to do something practical .
i attended journalism school in munich , helped found the left-wing taz newspaper here in berlin and then went to the berliner zeitung .
i always did what i thought was fun , namely : writing .
and i kept having ideas i thought should write about .
i think my distance from the academy is productive because it continually opens up new questions .
historical writing is only as good as the questions you ask about history .
25 years ago i wrote a study of the nazi euthanasia programs against the mentally ill .
if i ’ d become a normal professor , i ’ d probably still be organizing workshops , editing academic compendia and advising dissertations on that topic .
or perhaps i would have been suffocated by boredom . how do you hope english readers will react to your book ? i think readers in the us and post-thatcher england may have problems understanding the importance of the social welfare state .
but i hope it opens up new perspectives .
in particular i hope we can get away from the paradigm that the historian ’ s job is to distinguish between good and evil .
too often we ’ re supposed to say that everything we value today has its origins in something good .
but good and evil , even the most terrible sorts of evil , are inextricably linked .
it ’ s difficult to comprehend that something like auschwitz could be connected in any way to things we today think are good .
but i think that such painful insights are the ones that help us understand the totalitarian systems of the past as people striving for a better world .

the troops will hunt suspected traffickers , patrol the coast and man checkpoints , a senior official said .
the city , across the border from san diego in california , is a major entry point for drugs into the us .
it has been hit by violence between rival drug gangs , with more than 300 killings in 2006 .
the new president , felipe calderon , who was sworn in last month , has vowed to curb drug-related violence .
' hostage to crime ' interior minister francisco ramirez acuna said the tijuana force would be backed by 28 boats , 21 planes and nine helicopters .
" we will carry out all the necessary actions to retake every region of national territory , " he said .
" we will not allow any state to be a hostage of drug traffickers or organised crime . "
hundreds of police arrived in the city on tuesday , the associated press news agency reported , and more are expected in the coming days .
last month mr calderon sent 7,000 troops to michoacan state on the pacific coast to curb the drug violence .
more than 500 people died in violence there in 2006 .

the troops will hunt suspected traffickers , patrol the coast and man checkpoints , a senior official said .
the city , across the border from san diego in california , is a major entry point for drugs into the us .
it has been hit by violence between rival drug gangs , with more than 300 killings in 2006 .
the new president , felipe calderon , who was sworn in last month , has vowed to curb drug-related violence .
' hostage to crime ' interior minister francisco ramirez acuna said the tijuana force would be backed by 28 boats , 21 planes and nine helicopters .
" we will carry out all the necessary actions to retake every region of national territory , " he said .
" we will not allow any state to be a hostage of drug traffickers or organised crime . "
hundreds of police arrived in the city on tuesday , the associated press news agency reported , and more are expected in the coming days .
last month mr calderon sent 7,000 troops to michoacan state on the pacific coast to curb the drug violence .
more than 500 people died in violence there in 2006 .
in the worst incident , masked men burst into a bar in uruapan and flung five human heads onto a crowded dance floor in an apparent warning to a rival drug gang .
since the deployment in michoacan the troops have arrested more than 50 people , some suspected members of rival gangs .
in a new year 's message , mr calderon pledged to intensify the fight against crime and drug trafficking .
" the operations will allow us to re-establish the minimal security conditions in different points of mexico so we can recover little by little our streets , our parks and our schools , " he said .

but britain is not among the countries which have granted romanians and bulgarians the right to work from day one of their accession .
if you want to know what romanians in britain think about this , one option is to visit one of the new romanian restaurants in london .
there is one in edmonton , and another in mill hill , but i went to 32 old bailey - a few hundred metres away from the romanian church in fleet street - where i found a party in full swing .
the owner , ovidiu sarpe , is looking forward to 2007 .
" we hope many romanians will come looking for work and will become our clients , " he says .
scapegoats the tables are full of romanian dishes , among them the famous sarmale , minced meat in cabbage leaves .
and an enticing smell comes from the kitchen , where the main cook is georgeta patulea .
sarmale are cabbage leaves , stuffed with minced meat some dishes from the new eu a cook for 20 years in romania , she has been in the uk for one year , and finds the work much easier .
" in romania you had to give up your rest days , whereas here your rights are scrupulously respected .
" i found it odd in the beginning , when i was told to go home after eight hours .
i could n't believe it , " mrs patulea confesses .
her co-worker , from poland , is just placing some mititei - another romanian speciality , minced beef and lamb in cylindrical shapes - on the grill .
back in the restaurant , claudiu , a customer , is smoking at the bar .
after a few months in london he is rather disillusioned .
" any romanian who comes to london hopes for the best , but the reality turns out otherwise , " he says .
he is disappointed about the stories in the british press that whipped up fears of the country being swamped by bulgarian and romanian migrants , and about the government 's decision to restrict their freedom to work .
many romanians feel they have been made scapegoats for the unexpected influx of foreign workers , mainly poles , that arrived in the uk after the last wave of eu enlargement in 2004 .
retraining claudiu warns romanians who want to try their luck to think twice .
" if you have no right to work , you ca n't make money in britain .
labour on the black market is scarce and is downright dangerous " , he says . "
for those who are serious , enthusiastic and patient , for those who invest and do not expect a profit the next day , there is no better country than britain " ovidiu sarpe " my advice to romanians is : if you come determined to work , do it , but bring some money with you , not just money for a plane ticket and £ 100 for expenses .
with this sort of money you will be forced to return pretty soon . "
one of the guests is maria , a young woman , who came to britain six years ago and now works as a solicitor .
" as a foreign lawyer it is very hard , because you have to speak english very well , and you have to retrain for the english legal system .
" there are few romanian lawyers , but there is a growing demand and romania 's accession to the eu will create new opportunities " , maria tells me .
she too is disappointed about the attitude of the british press towards romanian immigrants .
but in the end , she says hard work and the desire to succeed will overcome all of these obstacles .
it is late evening and the romanian restaurant has become very crowded .
food has all but vanished from the bar but mr sarpe finds some extra sarmale for latecomers .
his advice for would-be migrant workers is the same as maria 's .
" it is hard , but for those who are serious , enthusiastic and patient , for those who invest and do not expect a profit the next day , there is no better country than britain . "

ovidiu sarpe is expecting new romanian clients in london but britain is not among the countries which have granted romanians and bulgarians the right to work from day one of their accession .
if you want to know what romanians in britain think about this , one option is to visit one of the new romanian restaurants in london .
there is one in edmonton , and another in mill hill , but i went to 32 old bailey - a few hundred metres away from the romanian church in fleet street - where i found a party in full swing .
the owner , ovidiu sarpe , is looking forward to 2007 .
" we hope many romanians will come looking for work and will become our clients , " he says .
scapegoats the tables are full of romanian dishes , among them the famous sarmale , minced meat in cabbage leaves .
and an enticing smell comes from the kitchen , where the main cook is georgeta patulea .
sarmale are cabbage leaves , stuffed with minced meat some dishes from the new eu a cook for 20 years in romania , she has been in the uk for one year , and finds the work much easier .
" in romania you had to give up your rest days , whereas here your rights are scrupulously respected .
" i found it odd in the beginning , when i was told to go home after eight hours .
i could n't believe it , " mrs patulea confesses .
her co-worker , from poland , is just placing some mititei - another romanian speciality , minced beef and lamb in cylindrical shapes - on the grill .
back in the restaurant , claudiu , a customer , is smoking at the bar .
after a few months in london he is rather disillusioned .
" any romanian who comes to london hopes for the best , but the reality turns out otherwise , " he says .
he is disappointed about the stories in the british press that whipped up fears of the country being swamped by bulgarian and romanian migrants , and about the government 's decision to restrict their freedom to work .
many romanians feel they have been made scapegoats for the unexpected influx of foreign workers , mainly poles , that arrived in the uk after the last wave of eu enlargement in 2004 .
retraining claudiu warns romanians who want to try their luck to think twice .
" if you have no right to work , you ca n't make money in britain .
labour on the black market is scarce and is downright dangerous " , he says .
for those who are serious , enthusiastic and patient , for those who invest and do not expect a profit the next day , there is no better country than britain ovidiu sarpe " my advice to romanians is : if you come determined to work , do it , but bring some money with you , not just money for a plane ticket and £ 100 for expenses .
with this sort of money you will be forced to return pretty soon . "
one of the guests is maria , a young woman , who came to britain six years ago and now works as a solicitor .
" as a foreign lawyer it is very hard , because you have to speak english very well , and you have to retrain for the english legal system .
" there are few romanian lawyers , but there is a growing demand and romania 's accession to the eu will create new opportunities " , maria tells me .

last year there were 4,000 cases of rubbish left on farmland in wales and england , not necessarily by farmers .
there were more than 120,000 cases on footpaths and bridle paths - and these were just the recorded incidents .
but the environment agency and councils have said they prosecute individuals and companies if they have the evidence .
anglesey council spends about £ 100,000 annually on clearing rubbish which has been dumped illegally in the countryside . "
if we 're able to get a registration number then we can go ahead and prosecute " euryn roberts , environment agency gerallt jones , a waste enforcement officer with anglesey council , said : " we deal with hundreds of incidents every year .
the materials dumped range from household waste to asbestos , tyres and car batteries .
" there is absolutely no excuse for dumping household items - the council will collect them for free .
i can only think it 's utter laziness . "
in some areas the environment agency in partnership with local councils set up surveillance areas .
euryn roberts from the agency said : " in areas where we 've put up cameras they 've been very successful - although it is very time-consuming and can be very frustrating .
" but if we 're able to get a registration number then we can go ahead and prosecute . "
one success story is a lay-by near gwalchmai on anglesey - a lay-by which had to be cleared at least twice a week because of the waste dumped there .
" the cameras have been very effective here and mean the problem has just about disappeared , " adds mr roberts .
mr jones said anglesey council has a zero tolerance policy towards illegal dumping .
" if we have the evidence then we will prosecute .
the fines can be up to £ 50,000 and up to five years in prison , " he added .
the period after christmas is notoriously bad for illegal dumping but the authorities are warning that the price for breaking the law is a high one .

last year there were 4,000 cases of rubbish left on farmland in wales and england , not necessarily by farmers .
there were more than 120,000 cases on footpaths and bridle paths - and these were just the recorded incidents .
but the environment agency and councils have said they prosecute individuals and companies if they have the evidence .
anglesey council spends about £ 100,000 annually on clearing rubbish which has been dumped illegally in the countryside .
if we 're able to get a registration number then we can go ahead and prosecute euryn roberts , environment agency gerallt jones , a waste enforcement officer with anglesey council , said : " we deal with hundreds of incidents every year .
the materials dumped range from household waste to asbestos , tyres and car batteries .
" there is absolutely no excuse for dumping household items - the council will collect them for free .
i can only think it 's utter laziness . "
in some areas the environment agency in partnership with local councils set up surveillance areas .
euryn roberts from the agency said : " in areas where we 've put up cameras they 've been very successful - although it is very time-consuming and can be very frustrating .

a recent census carried out at a national park in bardiya suggested there were only 26 rhinos left .
the number stood at 83 four years ago .
rhinos have also dwindled in chitwan park where the population has fallen to 405 from more than 500 in 2000 .
poachers are suspected to have killed the animal whose horn is sought after for its alleged aphrodisiac qualities .
some reports have suggested that some rhinos may have moved across the borders to india , but a senior conservation official , phanindra kharel , has ruled that out .
lack of security the kantipur newspaper quoted him as saying there was no chance of the rhinos moving out .
they had been transferred to bardiya from chitwan national park , in central nepal , over the past two decades .
the translocation had been seen as a major conservation move .
authorities say the poachers have capitalised on the lack of security caused by the long-running maoist insurgency .
a number of security posts had been removed from the parks following the maoist threat .
security posts are being re-instated in and around national parks following a recent peace accord between the government and the maoist rebels .

we are revealing one artist from the top five every day until friday , when the winner and full top 10 will be announced .
it is 6:30pm on a saturday evening and in a club below london bridge station , several hundred teenagers are letting out an ecstatic , ear-splitting cheer .
the air is suddenly filled with fluorescent glowsticks , the original rave accessory , turning the crowd into a mass of waving coloured tentacles that would not look out of place in the great barrier reef .
then there are the whistles , fluorescent face paint , sparklers and day-glo clothes .
the klaxons look slightly astonished at the reaction .
the " new rave " scene they have championed - which has been viewed with scepticism by many - does seem to be thriving .
the band coined the " new rave " term after they formed just over a year ago and , sensing a new scene in the air , the nme has grabbed the bandwagon 's reins .
" i think it 's becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy , " says singer and bassist jamie reynolds . "
we came together with the intention of making a successful pop band " simon taylor -lrb- centre -rrb- " it 's now a global media phenomenon .
you read something in a foreign language and you do n't understand a single word of it , and then the two words pop up next to each other .
unbelievable . "
a couple of days before their under-18s matinee show at the se one club , the band insist the genre they created is a bona fide movement .
but they also seem wary at the speed and enthusiasm with which fans and journalists have picked up on their invention .
the band began their careers by covering two rave classics - the bouncer by kicks like a mule , including the mantra " your name 's not down , you 're not coming in " , and not over yet by grace .
both are still live favourites .
" everything 's got rehashed over the last five years , " reynolds says .
" and for us , it seemed like the early ' 90s was the only thing that had n't yet been rehashed . "
celebration does n't come with po-faced music , celebration comes with popular anthems " jamie reynolds " and as soon as we did that - rehashing the only thing there was left - it put a stop to that and we wanted to make a fresh start .
" now we 're left with the fact that we have to create something completely new and fresh . "
they have borrowed the pulsating tempo , pounding rhythms and hypnotic vocals from old rave - and say music should be a " celebration " .
but they are a guitar band first and foremost , not synthesiser boffins , and their music also borrows bits from punk and early 1980s electro-pop .
and despite the hype , the klaxons ' tunes do stand up - especially the infectious singles golden skans and gravity 's rainbow .
" we came together with the intention of making a successful pop band , " declares guitarist simon taylor .
it is a startling statement for a guitar band whose image and sound are far from the modern pop stereotype , and who would normally be expected to treat pop as a four-letter word .
but the klaxons want the mainstream to come to them , instead of being forced to fit into the existing mould .
" we had no interest in being po-faced or cool , we wanted to be popular , " says reynolds .
" celebration does n't come with po-faced music , celebration comes with popular anthems , popular sing-along records . "
' real personalities ' james righton - who contributes vocals , guitars and keyboards - adds : " it would be great to see next year that pop does get its revival .
" it would be incredible if there was a real improvement in the state of music , and if songs became more pop and better - written and performed by people who actually were real pop stars .
" the music industry in general lacks real personalities who write good songs . "
get the glowstick ready , the klaxons are ready to win over the sceptics .
more than 130 impartial uk-based music writers , editors and broadcasters took part in to the sound of 2007 poll by naming their three favourite new acts .
these tips were weighted to take account of each pundit 's stature , genre and record in previous polls , as well as the order in which they ranked their tips , with the results compiled into a top 10 .

we are revealing one artist from the top five every day until friday , when the winner and full top 10 will be announced .
golden skans by the klaxons it is 6:30pm on a saturday evening and in a club below london bridge station , several hundred teenagers are letting out an ecstatic , ear-splitting cheer .
the air is suddenly filled with fluorescent glowsticks , the original rave accessory , turning the crowd into a mass of waving coloured tentacles that would not look out of place in the great barrier reef .
then there are the whistles , fluorescent face paint , sparklers and day-glo clothes .
the klaxons look slightly astonished at the reaction .
the " new rave " scene they have championed - which has been viewed with scepticism by many - does seem to be thriving .
the band coined the " new rave " term after they formed just over a year ago and , sensing a new scene in the air , the nme has grabbed the bandwagon 's reins .
" i think it 's becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy , " says singer and bassist jamie reynolds .
we came together with the intention of making a successful pop band simon taylor -lrb- centre -rrb- " it 's now a global media phenomenon .
you read something in a foreign language and you do n't understand a single word of it , and then the two words pop up next to each other .
unbelievable . "
a couple of days before their under-18s matinee show at the se one club , the band insist the genre they created is a bona fide movement .
but they also seem wary at the speed and enthusiasm with which fans and journalists have picked up on their invention .
the band began their careers by covering two rave classics - the bouncer by kicks like a mule , including the mantra " your name 's not down , you 're not coming in " , and not over yet by grace .
both are still live favourites .
" everything 's got rehashed over the last five years , " reynolds says .
" and for us , it seemed like the early ' 90s was the only thing that had n't yet been rehashed .
celebration does n't come with po-faced music , celebration comes with popular anthems jamie reynolds " and as soon as we did that - rehashing the only thing there was left - it put a stop to that and we wanted to make a fresh start .
" now we 're left with the fact that we have to create something completely new and fresh . "
they have borrowed the pulsating tempo , pounding rhythms and hypnotic vocals from old rave - and say music should be a " celebration " .
but they are a guitar band first and foremost , not synthesiser boffins , and their music also borrows bits from punk and early 1980s electro-pop .
and despite the hype , the klaxons ' tunes do stand up - especially the infectious singles golden skans and gravity 's rainbow .
the band have gained an enthusiastic live following " we came together with the intention of making a successful pop band , " declares guitarist simon taylor .
it is a startling statement for a guitar band whose image and sound are far from the modern pop stereotype , and who would normally be expected to treat pop as a four-letter word .
but the klaxons want the mainstream to come to them , instead of being forced to fit into the existing mould .
" we had no interest in being po-faced or cool , we wanted to be popular , " says reynolds .
" celebration does n't come with po-faced music , celebration comes with popular anthems , popular sing-along records . "
' real personalities ' james righton - who contributes vocals , guitars and keyboards - adds : " it would be great to see next year that pop does get its revival .
" it would be incredible if there was a real improvement in the state of music , and if songs became more pop and better - written and performed by people who actually were real pop stars .
" the music industry in general lacks real personalities who write good songs . "
get the glowstick ready , the klaxons are ready to win over the sceptics .

the israeli team found men with three daughters and no sons were up to 60 % more likely to develop prostate cancer .
but the journal of the national cancer institute study suggests the cause may be the male " y " sex chromosome , not the act of having either a son or daughter .
uk experts said a common genetic cause may affect both cancer risk and the chance a man will father girls .
prostate cancer is the most common male cancer , with more than 30,000 new cases in the uk in 2003 .
it affects the prostate gland , which is found near the bladder in men , and produces one component of semen .
health aware the israeli research looked at more than 38,000 men , and compared the families of the 712 diagnosed with prostate cancer with those of the other men .
overall , compared with men who had at least one son , those with only daughters were 40 % more likely to develop prostate cancer .
the risk increased when a man had three or more daughters and no sons .
the researchers looked for alternative explanations for the apparent difference .
since prostate problems are often only detected when a man attends for routine health screening , they suggested that it was possible that having a predominantly female family might encourage a man to be more health-conscious . "
no-one should rush off with the idea that girls give their fathers prostate cancer " chris hiley prostate cancer charity another possibility was that men having daughter after daughter might go to the doctor to find out if there was any problem stopping them from fathering a son .
poor conception however , there was no evidence to support these explanations , and the researchers suggested that a genetic cause could be contributing to both the birth of daughters and the risk of cancer .
men supply one sex chromosome in their sperm - this can be either a y , producing a male embryo , or an x , producing a female embryo .
faults on the man 's y chromosome might not only affect the likelihood of conception or development of male offspring , but also lead to cancer development , it was suggested .
the prostate cancer charity head of policy and research chris hiley said : " this is an interesting study - it certainly attracts the attention , but it does n't yet translate into useful advice for men until other complex genetic studies are done .
" further research to confirm these findings in men from other parts of the world is needed .
" we also need to uncover exactly what it is about the y chromosome , which only men have , that might make men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer also more likely to have fathered girls rather than boys .
" in the meantime no-one should rush off with the idea that girls give their fathers prostate cancer . "

the israeli team found men with three daughters and no sons were up to 60 % more likely to develop prostate cancer .
but the journal of the national cancer institute study suggests the cause may be the male " y " sex chromosome , not the act of having either a son or daughter .
uk experts said a common genetic cause may affect both cancer risk and the chance a man will father girls .
prostate cancer is the most common male cancer , with more than 30,000 new cases in the uk in 2003 .
it affects the prostate gland , which is found near the bladder in men , and produces one component of semen .
health aware the israeli research looked at more than 38,000 men , and compared the families of the 712 diagnosed with prostate cancer with those of the other men .
overall , compared with men who had at least one son , those with only daughters were 40 % more likely to develop prostate cancer .
the risk increased when a man had three or more daughters and no sons .

no-one should rush off with the idea that girls give their fathers prostate cancer chris hiley prostate cancer charity another possibility was that men having daughter after daughter might go to the doctor to find out if there was any problem stopping them from fathering a son .
poor conception however , there was no evidence to support these explanations , and the researchers suggested that a genetic cause could be contributing to both the birth of daughters and the risk of cancer .
men supply one sex chromosome in their sperm - this can be either a y , producing a male embryo , or an x , producing a female embryo .
faults on the man 's y chromosome might not only affect the likelihood of conception or development of male offspring , but also lead to cancer development , it was suggested .
the prostate cancer charity head of policy and research chris hiley said : " this is an interesting study - it certainly attracts the attention , but it does n't yet translate into useful advice for men until other complex genetic studies are done .
" further research to confirm these findings in men from other parts of the world is needed .
" we also need to uncover exactly what it is about the y chromosome , which only men have , that might make men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer also more likely to have fathered girls rather than boys .

mobiles have become part of life for many iraqis in just a few years while those pictures were revealed in the us media , the saddam video appears to have been a purely iraqi affair .
as foreign news organisations downloaded it from the internet , it was already being swapped among ordinary iraqis on their mobile phones .
the iraqi government 's own , edited version , was undermined by the ugly audio of the shouted sectarian shia slogans .
the mobile phone , that symbol of freedom and independence , had come into its own in iraq in the most dramatic way .
alarming images for many outsiders , one of the most graphic horrors of the iraqi conflict has been the posting of beheading videos on the internet but , within the country , interactive communications rest on the phone , not the web .
communications in iraq population : 26.5million land and mobile phone lines today : 4.6m today land lines in 2003:1.2m part of population with internet access : 0.1 % sources : usaid , internet world stats just 0.1 % of a population of nearly 27 million has web access , according to a 2006 estimate published by internet world stats .
by contrast , neighbouring iran has about 100 times as many , it says .
meanwhile , websites like youtube and ogrish.com positively teem with clips posted by us soldiers of their service in iraq .
officially , the us military confines its monitoring to scouring blogs for factual inaccuracies but there is also concern about some of the videos and stills appearing , a us military public affairs officer in iraq told the bbc last year .
such material , he said , might be used by america 's enemies to portray us soldiers as " barbaric warmongers " .
it appears that iraq 's government was similarly concerned about how the execution of saddam would be portrayed .
" before we went into the room we had an agreement that no-one should bring a mobile phone , " sami al-askari , an adviser to iraqi prime minister nouri maliki , said afterwards .
execution for sale phones are what iraqis now have in relative abundance : since the 2003 invasion , the number of handsets has gone from 1.2m land lines to 4.6m land and mobile lines , according to the us government .
this is not something that governments are likely to prevent unless they have great experience anthony cordesman us strategy analyst pentagon keeps eye on war videos " the new handsets are reliable and widely affordable , " amer al-harky , a 25-year-old doctor in the iraqi kurdish city of irbil , told the bbc news website .
after the february 2006 attack on the shia shrine in samarra , staff at the bbc bureau in baghdad noted a surge in gory video of the conflict being swapped between mobile phones .
one clip , for instance , showed what appeared to be shia gunmen killing a sunni man .
have your say they should n't have done the execution in this manner .
they should have done it with full respect reza , shiraz , iran send us your comments on the day after saddam 's hanging , a trader in a shia part of baghdad told afp news agency that his mobile phone shop was selling the gallows phone camera footage for 500 dinars -lrb- 40 us cents -rrb- a time .
and for those without a mobile , video of iraq 's death squads and their victims is available to buy on dvd .
" the dvds are not openly on sale but you can go to certain shops and buy these things for less than one us dollar , " says dr harky .
simon henderson of the washington institute for near east policy , who has written a biography of saddam , recalls that " horrific " footage of political suspects being tortured under saddam 's rule was sold on tapes or dvds in the streets after he was overthrown .
' inexperience ' given the interest in saddam 's own execution , how could the iraqi authorities and their us allies have allowed a camera to enter the gallows room along with the official one ?
a secret camera was used at an execution in the us in 1928 us-based media analyst danny schechter , who describes the execution as a " colonial hanging " , believes it was a " unique example of a total screw-up " , coming after what he describes as a long procession of miscalculations by the iraqi and us authorities .
its handling , he said , showed a refusal to listen to advice and a willingness to risk sectarian violence in iraq .
however , concealed cameras at executions are nothing new , us strategy analyst anthony cordesman of the centre for strategic and international studies says .
" this is not something that governments are likely to prevent unless they have great experience and certainly this government obviously did n't , " he told the bbc news website , recalling how a us reporter secretly photographed an execution in 1928 with a camera strapped to his ankle .
mr cordesman points out that the execution had to be conducted at short notice in a way where it " could not become the subject of terrorism , there could n't be rescue attempts and witnesses had to be rushed in with very little preparation " .
" this is wartime , it is a situation where the iraqi government is in considerable disarray and you are operating in a region where western standards , to put it mildly , do n't apply , " he says .
simon henderson suggests that the desire of some iraqis to see footage of saddam 's execution owes much to the brutalisation of society under his rule .

mobiles have become part of life for many iraqis in just a few years while those pictures were revealed in the us media , the saddam video appears to have been a purely iraqi affair .
as foreign news organisations downloaded it from the internet , it was already being swapped among ordinary iraqis on their mobile phones .
the iraqi government 's own , edited version , was undermined by the ugly audio of the shouted sectarian shia slogans .
the mobile phone , that symbol of freedom and independence , had come into its own in iraq in the most dramatic way .
alarming images for many outsiders , one of the most graphic horrors of the iraqi conflict has been the posting of beheading videos on the internet but , within the country , interactive communications rest on the phone , not the web .
communications in iraq population : 26.5million land and mobile phone lines today : 4.6m today land lines in 2003:1.2m part of population with internet access : 0.1 % sources : usaid , internet world stats just 0.1 % of a population of nearly 27 million has web access , according to a 2006 estimate published by internet world stats .
by contrast , neighbouring iran has about 100 times as many , it says .
meanwhile , websites like youtube and ogrish.com positively teem with clips posted by us soldiers of their service in iraq .
officially , the us military confines its monitoring to scouring blogs for factual inaccuracies but there is also concern about some of the videos and stills appearing , a us military public affairs officer in iraq told the bbc last year .
such material , he said , might be used by america 's enemies to portray us soldiers as " barbaric warmongers " .
it appears that iraq 's government was similarly concerned about how the execution of saddam would be portrayed .
" before we went into the room we had an agreement that no-one should bring a mobile phone , " sami al-askari , an adviser to iraqi prime minister nouri maliki , said afterwards .
execution for sale phones are what iraqis now have in relative abundance : since the 2003 invasion , the number of handsets has gone from 1.2m land lines to 4.6m land and mobile lines , according to the us government .
this is not something that governments are likely to prevent unless they have great experience anthony cordesman us strategy analyst pentagon keeps eye on war videos " the new handsets are reliable and widely affordable , " amer al-harky , a 25-year-old doctor in the iraqi kurdish city of irbil , told the bbc news website .
after the february 2006 attack on the shia shrine in samarra , staff at the bbc bureau in baghdad noted a surge in gory video of the conflict being swapped between mobile phones .
one clip , for instance , showed what appeared to be shia gunmen killing a sunni man .
have your say they should n't have done the execution in this manner .
they should have done it with full respect reza , shiraz , iran send us your comments on the day after saddam 's hanging , a trader in a shia part of baghdad told afp news agency that his mobile phone shop was selling the gallows phone camera footage for 500 dinars -lrb- 40 us cents -rrb- a time .
and for those without a mobile , video of iraq 's death squads and their victims is available to buy on dvd .
" the dvds are not openly on sale but you can go to certain shops and buy these things for less than one us dollar , " says dr harky .
simon henderson of the washington institute for near east policy , who has written a biography of saddam , recalls that " horrific " footage of political suspects being tortured under saddam 's rule was sold on tapes or dvds in the streets after he was overthrown .
' inexperience ' given the interest in saddam 's own execution , how could the iraqi authorities and their us allies have allowed a camera to enter the gallows room along with the official one ?
a secret camera was used at an execution in the us in 1928 us-based media analyst danny schechter , who describes the execution as a " colonial hanging " , believes it was a " unique example of a total screw-up " , coming after what he describes as a long procession of miscalculations by the iraqi and us authorities .
its handling , he said , showed a refusal to listen to advice and a willingness to risk sectarian violence in iraq .
however , concealed cameras at executions are nothing new , us strategy analyst anthony cordesman of the centre for strategic and international studies says .
" this is not something that governments are likely to prevent unless they have great experience and certainly this government obviously did n't , " he told the bbc news website , recalling how a us reporter secretly photographed an execution in 1928 with a camera strapped to his ankle .
mr cordesman points out that the execution had to be conducted at short notice in a way where it " could not become the subject of terrorism , there could n't be rescue attempts and witnesses had to be rushed in with very little preparation " .
" this is wartime , it is a situation where the iraqi government is in considerable disarray and you are operating in a region where western standards , to put it mildly , do n't apply , " he says .
simon henderson suggests that the desire of some iraqis to see footage of saddam 's execution owes much to the brutalisation of society under his rule .
this , after all , was a man who used to take his own sons uday and qusay to witness torture sessions .

mobiles have become part of life for many iraqis in just a few years while those pictures were revealed in the us media , the saddam video appears to have been a purely iraqi affair .
as foreign news organisations downloaded it from the internet , it was already being swapped among ordinary iraqis on their mobile phones .
the iraqi government 's own , edited version , was undermined by the ugly audio of the shouted sectarian shia slogans .
the mobile phone , that symbol of freedom and independence , had come into its own in iraq in the most dramatic way .
alarming images for many outsiders , one of the most graphic horrors of the iraqi conflict has been the posting of beheading videos on the internet but , within the country , interactive communications rest on the phone , not the web .
communications in iraq population : 26.5million land and mobile phone lines today : 4.6m today land lines in 2003:1.2m part of population with internet access : 0.1 % sources : usaid , internet world stats just 0.1 % of a population of nearly 27 million has web access , according to a 2006 estimate published by internet world stats .
by contrast , neighbouring iran has about 100 times as many , it says .
meanwhile , websites like youtube and ogrish.com positively teem with clips posted by us soldiers of their service in iraq .
officially , the us military confines its monitoring to scouring blogs for factual inaccuracies but there is also concern about some of the videos and stills appearing , a us military public affairs officer in iraq told the bbc last year .
such material , he said , might be used by america 's enemies to portray us soldiers as " barbaric warmongers " .
it appears that iraq 's government was similarly concerned about how the execution of saddam would be portrayed .
" before we went into the room we had an agreement that no-one should bring a mobile phone , " sami al-askari , an adviser to iraqi prime minister nouri maliki , said afterwards .
execution for sale phones are what iraqis now have in relative abundance : since the 2003 invasion , the number of handsets has gone from 1.2m land lines to 4.6m land and mobile lines , according to the us government .
this is not something that governments are likely to prevent unless they have great experience anthony cordesman us strategy analyst pentagon keeps eye on war videos " the new handsets are reliable and widely affordable , " amer al-harky , a 25-year-old doctor in the iraqi kurdish city of irbil , told the bbc news website .
after the february 2006 attack on the shia shrine in samarra , staff at the bbc bureau in baghdad noted a surge in gory video of the conflict being swapped between mobile phones .
one clip , for instance , showed what appeared to be shia gunmen killing a sunni man .
have your say they should n't have done the execution in this manner .
they should have done it with full respect reza , shiraz , iran send us your comments on the day after saddam 's hanging , a trader in a shia part of baghdad told afp news agency that his mobile phone shop was selling the gallows phone camera footage for 500 dinars -lrb- 40 us cents -rrb- a time .
and for those without a mobile , video of iraq 's death squads and their victims is available to buy on dvd .
" the dvds are not openly on sale but you can go to certain shops and buy these things for less than one us dollar , " says dr harky .
simon henderson of the washington institute for near east policy , who has written a biography of saddam , recalls that " horrific " footage of political suspects being tortured under saddam 's rule was sold on tapes or dvds in the streets after he was overthrown .
' inexperience ' given the interest in saddam 's own execution , how could the iraqi authorities and their us allies have allowed a camera to enter the gallows room along with the official one ?
a secret camera was used at an execution in the us in 1928 us-based media analyst danny schechter , who describes the execution as a " colonial hanging " , believes it was a " unique example of a total screw-up " , coming after what he describes as a long procession of miscalculations by the iraqi and us authorities .
its handling , he said , showed a refusal to listen to advice and a willingness to risk sectarian violence in iraq .
however , concealed cameras at executions are nothing new , us strategy analyst anthony cordesman of the centre for strategic and international studies says .
" this is not something that governments are likely to prevent unless they have great experience and certainly this government obviously did n't , " he told the bbc news website , recalling how a us reporter secretly photographed an execution in 1928 with a camera strapped to his ankle .
mr cordesman points out that the execution had to be conducted at short notice in a way where it " could not become the subject of terrorism , there could n't be rescue attempts and witnesses had to be rushed in with very little preparation " .
" this is wartime , it is a situation where the iraqi government is in considerable disarray and you are operating in a region where western standards , to put it mildly , do n't apply , " he says .
simon henderson suggests that the desire of some iraqis to see footage of saddam 's execution owes much to the brutalisation of society under his rule .
this , after all , was a man who used to take his own sons uday and qusay to witness torture sessions .

officially , the us military confines its monitoring to scouring blogs for factual inaccuracies but there is also concern about some of the videos and stills appearing , a us military public affairs officer in iraq told the bbc last year .
such material , he said , might be used by america 's enemies to portray us soldiers as " barbaric warmongers " .
it appears that iraq 's government was similarly concerned about how the execution of saddam would be portrayed .
" before we went into the room we had an agreement that no-one should bring a mobile phone , " sami al-askari , an adviser to iraqi prime minister nouri maliki , said afterwards .
execution for sale phones are what iraqis now have in relative abundance : since the 2003 invasion , the number of handsets has gone from 1.2m land lines to 4.6m land and mobile lines , according to the us government . "
this is not something that governments are likely to prevent unless they have great experience " anthony cordesman us strategy analyst " the new handsets are reliable and widely affordable , " amer al-harky , a 25-year-old doctor in the iraqi kurdish city of irbil , told the bbc news website .
after the february 2006 attack on the shia shrine in samarra , staff at the bbc bureau in baghdad noted a surge in gory video of the conflict being swapped between mobile phones .
one clip , for instance , showed what appeared to be shia gunmen killing a sunni man .
have your say " they should n't have done the execution in this manner .
they should have done it with full respect " reza , shiraz , iran send us your comments on the day after saddam 's hanging , a trader in a shia part of baghdad told afp news agency that his mobile phone shop was selling the gallows phone camera footage for 500 dinars -lrb- 40 us cents -rrb- a time .
and for those without a mobile , video of iraq 's death squads and their victims is available to buy on dvd .
" the dvds are not openly on sale but you can go to certain shops and buy these things for less than one us dollar , " says dr harky .
simon henderson of the washington institute for near east policy , who has written a biography of saddam , recalls that " horrific " footage of political suspects being tortured under saddam 's rule was sold on tapes or dvds in the streets after he was overthrown .
' inexperience ' given the interest in saddam 's own execution , how could the iraqi authorities and their us allies have allowed a camera to enter the gallows room along with the official one ?
us-based media analyst danny schechter , who describes the execution as a " colonial hanging " , believes it was a " unique example of a total screw-up " , coming after what he describes as a long procession of miscalculations by the iraqi and us authorities .
its handling , he said , showed a refusal to listen to advice and a willingness to risk sectarian violence in iraq .
however , concealed cameras at executions are nothing new , us strategy analyst anthony cordesman of the centre for strategic and international studies says .
" this is not something that governments are likely to prevent unless they have great experience and certainly this government obviously did n't , " he told the bbc news website , recalling how a us reporter secretly photographed an execution in 1928 with a camera strapped to his ankle .
mr cordesman points out that the execution had to be conducted at short notice in a way where it " could not become the subject of terrorism , there could n't be rescue attempts and witnesses had to be rushed in with very little preparation " .
" this is wartime , it is a situation where the iraqi government is in considerable disarray and you are operating in a region where western standards , to put it mildly , do n't apply , " he says .
simon henderson suggests that the desire of some iraqis to see footage of saddam 's execution owes much to the brutalisation of society under his rule .
this , after all , was a man who used to take his own sons uday and qusay to witness torture sessions .

farming is responsible for 7 % of the uk 's greenhouse gas emissions and needs to be part of the effort to tackle climate change , the organisers say .
a website will offer farmers advice on what measures they can take , such as generating green energy from waste .
the project was launched at the oxford farming conference on wednesday .
the scheme , which runs for 12 months initially , is a collaboration between environment charity forum for the future , the national farmers ' union -lrb- nfu -rrb- , the applied research forum -lrb- arf -rrb- and the country land and business association -lrb- cla -rrb- .
' punch drunk ' jonathon porritt , founder director of forum for the future , said the role farmers could play in the climate debate had been overlooked .
" the farming community is somewhat punch drunk after the last few years because there have been so many changes , such as the -lsb- common agricultural policy -rsb- reforms and changes to farm payments .
the whole thing has been non-stop , " he told bbc news .
