program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 31.05.2007 finland to ban smoking in bars and restaurants on june 1 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu countries have already banned smoking on friday , finland is to become the latest european nation to ban smoking in bars and restaurants , a measure that is expected to be introduced fairly painlessly in the tobacco-critical state . finland already banned smoking in public places in 1977 and in workplaces in 1995 , leaving bars and restaurants as the only sanctuary until now .
according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "
a eurobarometer poll also showed that the complete ban on smoking in all public places is supported by 96 percent of finns , a higher figure than in the rest of europe .
latest attempts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relegated to the outdoors the latest ban is finland 's second bid at prohibiting smoking in bars and restaurants following a failed 1999 attempt .
" back then restaurant owners were very much against it , " simonen said .
" when we prepared the new legislation -lrb- this time -rrb- , we worked together with employers and unions and have reached a consensus . "
bars , cafés and restaurants larger than 50 square meters -lrb- 164 square feet -rrb- with a proper ventilation system can , during a two-year transition period , set up special smoking sections covering half the size of the premises .
in smaller establishments , cigarettes will be prohibited altogether or smoking rooms will have to be built .
the room can not let out any smoke and customers are not allowed to eat or drink in the special booths .
establishments failing to comply with the new law risk a fine as do smokers disobeying the law .
setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .
but the only european nation to meet that target so far is sweden , where 18 percent of people smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland wants to make smoking less " cool " among younth finland is not far behind .
according to the department for promotion of welfare and health , 22 percent of finns smoke , or 24 percent of men and 19 percent of women .
according to simonen " the minimum goal is to go under 20 percent . "
but the nordic state still has some way to go before reaching former prime minister paavo lipponen 's goal of a " zero smoking " population .
he also proposed banning all tobacco products in finland by 2040 .
" a ban would clearly outline the tobacco policy , " lipponen said .
" at the same time it would discourage young people from smoking . "
ireland was the first european state to introduce a complete ban on smoking in public places in march 2004 .
since then norway , italy , malta , sweden , scotland , latvia and lithuania have followed suit .
wales introduced a ban on april 2 , followed by northern ireland on april 30 .
belgium , denmark , england , france , germany , greece , iceland and romania also have similar plans . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's federal states agree smoking ban with exceptions germany 's federal states agreed thursday to ban smoking in restaurants and pubs , but allowed exceptions for small bars and premises with extra smoking rooms .
-lrb- 22.03.2007 -rrb- german states agree on limited smoking ban in restaurants germany 's 16 states agreed friday to a limited smoking ban in restaurants and cafes but left a wide berth for regions to create loopholes .

according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "
a eurobarometer poll also showed that the complete ban on smoking in all public places is supported by 96 percent of finns , a higher figure than in the rest of europe .
latest attempts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relegated to the outdoors the latest ban is finland 's second bid at prohibiting smoking in bars and restaurants following a failed 1999 attempt .
" back then restaurant owners were very much against it , " simonen said .
" when we prepared the new legislation -lrb- this time -rrb- , we worked together with employers and unions and have reached a consensus . "
bars , cafés and restaurants larger than 50 square meters -lrb- 164 square feet -rrb- with a proper ventilation system can , during a two-year transition period , set up special smoking sections covering half the size of the premises .
in smaller establishments , cigarettes will be prohibited altogether or smoking rooms will have to be built .
the room can not let out any smoke and customers are not allowed to eat or drink in the special booths .
establishments failing to comply with the new law risk a fine as do smokers disobeying the law .
setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de psychology -pipe- 31.05.2007 german pedophilia project touts results , pleads for funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a berlin project has taken aim at preventing child molestation a controversial project aimed at preventing pedophiles from acting on their sexual urges risks being shut down for lack of funds , despite reported success with its first group of patients . berlin ’ s charite clinic hospital shocked germans in 2005 when it advertised for potential child molesters to take part in an experimental behavioral therapy , known as prevention project dark field .
some 550 people responded to the ad campaign , which ran under the slogan , “ do you love children more than they want you to ? ”
ninety men were accepted for the initial round of therapy .
on wednesday , researchers said 20 men had successfully completed the therapy so far .
now , 45 men with either a history of child-molestation or an urge to do so , are waiting for a slot in a group slated to start in autumn .
but they may be waiting in vain .
the project is in danger of folding for lack of funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day at the park should be worry-free the idea behind the novel project is aimed at preventing child molestation .
the therapy , developed at the charite clinic , has been co-funded by the child-victim rights group hansel & gretel foundation , and the volkswagen foundation .
no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .
people who took part in the study were promised anonymity .
the message given to the patients was , “ you aren ’ t to blame for your sexual desires , but you are responsible for your sexual actions , ” beier said .
learning what children really want a key part of the course , described by the charite as unique world-wide , is to teach the potential pedophiles , through role-playing , to understand the child 's view and that they only imagined children were offering sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of those with the urge seem to want to fight it " one aim was to teach the pedophile men to clearly pick up their warning signals .
for example these could be thinking about a child often , giving a child presents or inviting a child over , " one therapist , david goecker , told dpa news service .
the men were better able to control their urges after the course of treatment , according to the researchers .
in severe cases , impulse-curbing drugs were prescribed , to improve behavior controls .
there is no guarantee the patients would not molest children in the future , " but we can reduce the risk , " said goecker .
funding is threatened despite the high demand and apparent successes , however , the future of the project is in danger .
the volkswagen foundation has said it would only continue its financing of the project if additional sponsors can be found , hansel & gretel ’ s ceo jerome braun told news agencies .
hansel & gretel chairwoman barbara schäfer-wiegand called upon the german federal ministry for education and research , as well as private donors and foundations , to lend their support to the therapy research . # b # one percent of german men are thought to have pedophilic tendencies , schäfer-wiegand said .
these people need to be exposed to therapy “ before thoughts turn to action . ”
' dark field ' outside the law per year , some 15,000 cases of child sex abuse are reported in germany , but the number of unreported cases is thought to be about four times that .
the project ’ s official name is the dark field prevention project : “ dark field ” standing for the shadowy area outside the legal system where potential child molesters lurk .
the project is aimed at three groups of people : men who have never assaulted a child but fear they may ; men who have already molested a child but were never charged , and those who where charged and completed their sentences , but who fear a relapse . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

sparks are already flying between us and germany , as washington accuses berlin of intolerance towards other viewpoints . us secretary of state condoleezza rice aimed a jab at germany 's environmental credentials wednesday ahead of an expected showdown at next week 's group of eight summit . rice said countries like germany , which prides itself on its green image , should respect the us policy of looking to technology to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions . " one has to wonder if you 're really concerned about greenhouse gas emissions why you are n't interested in nuclear power , " she told reporters at the end of a meeting of g8 foreign ministers in the eastern german city of potsdam .

" we 're seeking to achieve if not agreement then at least a closing of a gap between us .
it 's not an easy issue , " he said .
" as europeans we are coming closer together on setting limits and benchmarks .
other people are banking on technological solutions .
what is important is that in our international efforts we come closer together .

" it is there .

" that is the shared basis on which we are now acting , " merkel said , although she acknowledged much work had to be done .
the german chancellor also stressed that it was " very important to bring the un into the process .

"
he gave , however , few details and made no mention of mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions such as those contained in the kyoto protocol .
under the us proposal , nations would also develop " mid-term national targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs , " bush said .
the us has argued that it favors using technology to fight global warming rather than imposing emissions limits which could hamper economic growth .
limiting emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will g8 leaders reach agreement behind the fence ?
merkel , on the other hand , has staked germany 's 12-month g8 presidency on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases .
the prospects of that happening at the g8 summit in heiligendamm on the baltic coast appear increasingly slim , with clear differences appearing between g8 nations on how to limit greenhouse gases .
washington has strong objections to the proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for the summit , according to leaked documents .
british prime minister tony blair , however , called bush 's announcement tackling climate change a " big step forward .

the prospects of that happening at the g8 summit in heiligendamm on the baltic coast appear increasingly slim , with clear differences appearing between g8 nations on how to limit greenhouse gases .
washington has strong objections to the proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for the summit , according to leaked documents .
british prime minister tony blair , however , called bush 's announcement tackling climate change a " big step forward .
" this is what we have been working for , " blair said .
" obviously it 's a big step forward and it sets the right framework for next week 's meeting . "
the g8 summit will be attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush banks on clean energy technologies " we 're also going to work to conclude talks with other nations on eliminating tariffs and other barriers to clean energy technologies and services by the end of this year , " he said .
" we 'll help the world 's poorest nations reduce emissions by giving them government-developed technologies at low cost or in some case no cost at all , " said the us president .
amid early media reports of bush 's plan , greenpeace spokesman jörg feddern criticized the proposal as an attempt to undermine the united nations ' kyoto process with its mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions .
" this is fatal for climate protection , " feddern told afp .
the role of emerging economies under the kyoto procotol , 35 industrialized nations that have signed and ratified the pact are required to make targeted cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china so far fails to accept binding targets china and india 's status as developing nations exempts them from mandatory targets on greenhouse gas output , though they are fast becoming big emitters of greenhouse gases as they burn oil , gas and coal to power their economies .
the us administration has cited this as a reason for not submitting the protocol for ratification by the senate .
this week china and india both signaled that they were not ready to accept binding targets on cutting emissions in the post-kyoto era either . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahead of g8 , us-german tempers fray over green credentials the issue of cutting greenhouse gases is set to prove divisive at the upcoming g8 summit .

" one has to wonder if you 're really concerned about greenhouse gas emissions why you are n't interested in nuclear power , " she told reporters at the end of a meeting of g8 foreign ministers in the eastern german city of potsdam .

" we 're seeking to achieve if not agreement then at least a closing of a gap between us .
it 's not an easy issue , " he said .

experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .
" you have to be really well positioned in this business , " welfens said .

sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .

sparks are already flying between us and germany , as washington accuses berlin of intolerance towards other viewpoints . us secretary of state condoleezza rice aimed a jab at germany 's environmental credentials wednesday ahead of an expected showdown at next week 's group of eight summit . rice said countries like germany , which prides itself on its green image , should respect the us policy of looking to technology to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions . " one has to wonder if you 're really concerned about greenhouse gas emissions why you are n't interested in nuclear power , " she told reporters at the end of a meeting of g8 foreign ministers in the eastern german city of potsdam .

" we 're seeking to achieve if not agreement then at least a closing of a gap between us .
it 's not an easy issue , " he said .
" as europeans we are coming closer together on setting limits and benchmarks .
other people are banking on technological solutions .

experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moma in berlin " was a real crowd magnet some 1.2 million people flocked to see the hugely successful exhibition .
this time , the debonair art connoisseur secured a five-month loan of some 150 french 19th century art masterpieces belonging to the metropolitan museum of art on new york 's fifth avenue .
paintings by ingres , corot , courbet , puvis de chavannes , manet , degas , pissarro , monet , cezanne , gauguin , bonnard and matisse as well as sculptures by rodin and maillol will go on display at the neue nationalgalerie in berlin from june 1 to oct .
7 .
berlin 's " most beautiful french " exhibition is highlighted by five magnificent paintings by cezanne , eleven by courbet , 12 by degas , and seven by manet .
special halls are dedicated to the work of monet and degas .
nine sculptures by august rodin will also be on view , among them his spectacular " burghers of calais . "
foundations of modernity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the birth of venus " by alexandre cabanel the metropolitan museum of art has long boasted the largest and most significant permanent collection of 19th century french art alongside the musee d 'orsay in paris .
with france being the undisputed center of artistic development in the 19th century , the creations of that time laid the foundations of modernity as it dawned before the turn of the century .
monumental highlights of this epoch , such as ingres ' " odalisque in grisaille , " courbet 's " woman with a parrot , " manet 's " boating " , degas ' " the dance class " , monet 's " la grenouillere , " gauguin 's " la orana maria / hail mary " and rodin 's touching sculptures are all brought together for the first time in berlin at the exhibition .
permission to travel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rodin 's " adam " normally , the met 's prize french works are never allowed to leave the new york museum .
an exception was made by phillipe de montebello , the chief of the met , when plans were drafted for the renovation and enlargement of the 19th century galleries housing the museum 's european collections this summer .
this enabled the stunning collection of french art works to be sent to berlin .
curiously , berlin 's 2004 " moma " exhibition also came about in similar fashion , after the museum of modern art decided its premises also needed enlarging .
raue , a lawyer and the chairman of the city 's " friends of the national gallery foundation " has long enjoyed close collaborative ties with both the met and the museum of modern art in new york .
" we provide each other with generous loans , " raue said .
" we cooperate on exhibitions and both the directors and curators of the two museums know and respect each other . "
crowds expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition is expected to draw large crowds this latest major berlin exhibition is expected to draw huge crowds .
weeks before the official opening , 500 planned guided tours of the exhibition were fully booked out , and 1,500 first-day vip tickets snapped up .
a supplementary french exhibition is now also being staged at the alte nationalgalerie on the city 's museum island .
this museum was the first in germany to take a serious look at french impressionist painting .
already in 1896 , it had acquired a noted work by eduard manet titled " in the wintergarten . "
other paintings by monet , renoir , degas , cezanne and rodin would follow .
violet-colored pigs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " odalisque in grisaille " by jean auguste dominique ingres hugo von tschudi , who was the director of the nationalgalerie from 1896 to 1908 , had an often stormy relationship with german monarch kaiser wilhelm ii over his interest in french impressionist painting .
" please , no violet-colored pigs , " barked the kaiser when von tschudi first met him to talk about art acquisitions in 1896 .
von tschudi , who refused to be brow-beaten , would later establish contact with paul durand-ruel , a paris impressionist art dealer , from whom he secured not only manet 's noted " wintergarten " , but also works by courbet , monet , cezanne and degas for the alte nationalgalerie .
their art clashes later came to a head when the kaiser insisted all art gifts from wealthy patrons must from then on be agreed with him .

some 550 people responded to the ad campaign , which ran under the slogan , “ do you love children more than they want you to ? ”
ninety men were accepted for the initial round of therapy .
on wednesday , researchers said 20 men had successfully completed the therapy so far .
now , 45 men with either a history of child-molestation or an urge to do so , are waiting for a slot in a group slated to start in autumn .
but they may be waiting in vain .
the project is in danger of folding for lack of funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day at the park should be worry-free the idea behind the novel project is aimed at preventing child molestation .
the therapy , developed at the charite clinic , has been co-funded by the child-victim rights group hansel & gretel foundation , and the volkswagen foundation .
no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .
people who took part in the study were promised anonymity .
the message given to the patients was , “ you aren ’ t to blame for your sexual desires , but you are responsible for your sexual actions , ” beier said .
learning what children really want a key part of the course , described by the charite as unique world-wide , is to teach the potential pedophiles , through role-playing , to understand the child 's view and that they only imagined children were offering sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of those with the urge seem to want to fight it " one aim was to teach the pedophile men to clearly pick up their warning signals .
for example these could be thinking about a child often , giving a child presents or inviting a child over , " one therapist , david goecker , told dpa news service .
the men were better able to control their urges after the course of treatment , according to the researchers .
in severe cases , impulse-curbing drugs were prescribed , to improve behavior controls .
there is no guarantee the patients would not molest children in the future , " but we can reduce the risk , " said goecker .
funding is threatened despite the high demand and apparent successes , however , the future of the project is in danger .
the volkswagen foundation has said it would only continue its financing of the project if additional sponsors can be found , hansel & gretel ’ s ceo jerome braun told news agencies .
hansel & gretel chairwoman barbara schäfer-wiegand called upon the german federal ministry for education and research , as well as private donors and foundations , to lend their support to the therapy research . # b # one percent of german men are thought to have pedophilic tendencies , schäfer-wiegand said .
these people need to be exposed to therapy “ before thoughts turn to action . ”
' dark field ' outside the law per year , some 15,000 cases of child sex abuse are reported in germany , but the number of unreported cases is thought to be about four times that .
the project ’ s official name is the dark field prevention project : “ dark field ” standing for the shadowy area outside the legal system where potential child molesters lurk .

according to raw , unadjusted data published by the federal labor agency in nuremberg , the german jobless rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 9.1 percent in may , the lowest level since october 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mild weather is beneficial for the construction industry the overall jobless total declined by 161,000 to 3.806 million , the lowest number of dole-claimers in germany since november 2001 , the figures showed .
unemployment usually falls in the spring thanks to the warmer weather , which is favorable to sectors such as the construction industry .
labor market helped by warm weather adjusted for such seasonal effects , the jobless rate held steady at 9.2 percent , the lowest level since may 2001 , while the adjusted jobless total rose slightly by 3,000 to 3.855 million .
the small upward blip was unexpected - analysts had been penciling in a decline in the adjusted jobless total of around 12,000 this month - but was largely due to the unusually mild winter , which had caused fewer companies to lay off workers during the preceding months , as well as the heavy rain seen this month , analysts said .
" the economic upturn in germany is continuing apace and is helping to stimulate the labor market , " insisted labor office chief frank weise .
weise suggested that the unadjusted jobless total could fall below 3.5 million by the autumn , with the annual average total for the whole of 2007 likely to come out at 3.8-3.9 million .
analysts were similarly unfazed by the slight rise in the adjusted may jobless total this month .
" surveys of hiring intentions remain consistent with solid employment growth so the may figures may have been adversely affected by special factors such as the rainy weather , which has probably hurt activity in retail sales and construction , " said bnp paribas economist , caroline newhouse-cohen .
" all in all , we assume that there is still some scope for further employment growth and decreasing unemployment over the coming months , " the analyst said .
all the right indicators in place indeed , key confidence surveys such as the zew and widely-watched ifo indices suggested that germany , among all the euro-area economies , was likely to prove most resilient to the strong euro , rising interest rates and the slowdown in growth in the united states , newhouse-cohen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines are getting shorter at german labor offices investor confidence , as measured by the monthly zew index , hit an 11-month high in may , while the ifo business climate index held steady just a fraction off its all-time high .
dekabank economist peter leonhardt similarly believed that the upturn on the german labor market " remains intact .
companies ' order books are full and confidence that the economy will continue to prosper is balm for the wounds of the labor market . "
bank of america economist holger schmieding said that the jobless data so far this year had likely been distorted by the unusually mild weather and a new seasonal program to keep people off the dole in the winter .
nevertheless , " the underlying trend in the labor market remains solid , " schmieding said .
" taking the last six months together , unemployment has fallen by a monthly average of 59,000 .
we consider this the underlying trend , which should soon be visible in the headline data again , " he said .
ixis-cib economist sylvain broyer predicted that the jobless figures may move sideways for a few months .
" but we expect the unemployment rate to decline in trend until mid-2008 as the recovery proves to be robust .

" the economic upturn in germany is continuing apace and is helping to stimulate the labor market , " insisted labor office chief frank weise .
weise suggested that the unadjusted jobless total could fall below 3.5 million by the autumn , with the annual average total for the whole of 2007 likely to come out at 3.8-3.9 million .
analysts were similarly unfazed by the slight rise in the adjusted may jobless total this month .
" surveys of hiring intentions remain consistent with solid employment growth so the may figures may have been adversely affected by special factors such as the rainy weather , which has probably hurt activity in retail sales and construction , " said bnp paribas economist , caroline newhouse-cohen .
" all in all , we assume that there is still some scope for further employment growth and decreasing unemployment over the coming months , " the analyst said .
all the right indicators in place indeed , key confidence surveys such as the zew and widely-watched ifo indices suggested that germany , among all the euro-area economies , was likely to prove most resilient to the strong euro , rising interest rates and the slowdown in growth in the united states , newhouse-cohen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines are getting shorter at german labor offices investor confidence , as measured by the monthly zew index , hit an 11-month high in may , while the ifo business climate index held steady just a fraction off its all-time high .
dekabank economist peter leonhardt similarly believed that the upturn on the german labor market " remains intact .
companies ' order books are full and confidence that the economy will continue to prosper is balm for the wounds of the labor market . "
bank of america economist holger schmieding said that the jobless data so far this year had likely been distorted by the unusually mild weather and a new seasonal program to keep people off the dole in the winter .
nevertheless , " the underlying trend in the labor market remains solid , " schmieding said .
" taking the last six months together , unemployment has fallen by a monthly average of 59,000 .
we consider this the underlying trend , which should soon be visible in the headline data again , " he said .
ixis-cib economist sylvain broyer predicted that the jobless figures may move sideways for a few months .
" but we expect the unemployment rate to decline in trend until mid-2008 as the recovery proves to be robust .
indeed , the jobless rate could reach 8.8 percent by the end of this year , " broyer suggested . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reports biggest tax surplus in modern history germany says it expects its biggest tax surplus for half a century as the economy once derided as the " sick man of europe " reaps the benefits from buoyant growth and moderate reforms .

according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "
a eurobarometer poll also showed that the complete ban on smoking in all public places is supported by 96 percent of finns , a higher figure than in the rest of europe .
latest attempts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relegated to the outdoors the latest ban is finland 's second bid at prohibiting smoking in bars and restaurants following a failed 1999 attempt .
" back then restaurant owners were very much against it , " simonen said .
" when we prepared the new legislation -lrb- this time -rrb- , we worked together with employers and unions and have reached a consensus . "
bars , cafés and restaurants larger than 50 square meters -lrb- 164 square feet -rrb- with a proper ventilation system can , during a two-year transition period , set up special smoking sections covering half the size of the premises .
in smaller establishments , cigarettes will be prohibited altogether or smoking rooms will have to be built .
the room can not let out any smoke and customers are not allowed to eat or drink in the special booths .
establishments failing to comply with the new law risk a fine as do smokers disobeying the law .
setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .
but the only european nation to meet that target so far is sweden , where 18 percent of people smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland wants to make smoking less " cool " among younth finland is not far behind .
according to the department for promotion of welfare and health , 22 percent of finns smoke , or 24 percent of men and 19 percent of women .
according to simonen " the minimum goal is to go under 20 percent . "
but the nordic state still has some way to go before reaching former prime minister paavo lipponen 's goal of a " zero smoking " population .
he also proposed banning all tobacco products in finland by 2040 .
" a ban would clearly outline the tobacco policy , " lipponen said .
" at the same time it would discourage young people from smoking . "
ireland was the first european state to introduce a complete ban on smoking in public places in march 2004 .
since then norway , italy , malta , sweden , scotland , latvia and lithuania have followed suit .
wales introduced a ban on april 2 , followed by northern ireland on april 30 .

in 2006 , emigration was at the highest level since the 1940s . more than 155,000 germans left the country last year , the federal statistics office said .
that 's around seven percent more than in the previous year .
the net emigration of germans last year rose to a post-unification high of 51,906 .

but there are still more foreigners coming to germany than leaving the country .
some 558,000 non-germans moved to the country in 2006 and 484,000 departed .

an increasing number of germans are leaving home and going abroad to live .
in 2006 , emigration was at the highest level since the 1940s . more than 155,000 germans left the country last year , the federal statistics office said .
that 's around seven percent more than in the previous year .
the net emigration of germans last year rose to a post-unification high of 51,906 .
this was up considerably from the previous year .
in 2005 , the gap between the number of germans leaving and returning was 16,764 .
favorite destinations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is the no. 1 destination for german emigrants " switzerland , the us and austria were the top three destinations , " said statistician claire brobecker .
the reasons for these trends is not included in the data received by the federal statistics office .
" we can not measure this on the basis of the information we receive .
it would be mere speculation , " said brobecker .
but the economy in germany has been sluggish in recent years - certainly in comparison with its alpine neighbors .
for the most part , germans are believed to be escaping unemployment or seeking better pay and conditions .
variations in mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of immigrants coming to germany has also sunk the majority of those leaving came from western germany and berlin -lrb- 143,000 -rrb- .
only 12,000 people from former communist eastern germany emigrated .
the proportion of women among the eastern emigrants was higher than among those leaving western germany . the number of immigrants coming to germany , which once drew millions of foreigners in the postwar economic boom years , has also dropped again .
this has been the case since 2001 .
but there are still more foreigners coming to germany than leaving the country .
some 558,000 non-germans moved to the country in 2006 and 484,000 departed .
within germany , the migration from the east to the wealthier west continued , with a net gain to the west of 54,000 people that is similar to recent years . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans go to switzerland videobox -lrb- 20.03.2007 -rrb- how many germans can switzerland take ?
when a swiss tabloid launched a campaign last week asking the nation how many germans switzerland can stomach , it did more to highlight an old inferiority complex than to reveal the dawning of a new anti-german age .
-lrb- 28.02.2007 -rrb- german emigration hits highest level in 55 years germans are moving abroad in record numbers .
according to the latest migration statistics , around 145,000 germans left home for greener pastures last year , the highest tally since 1950 .

some 550 people responded to the ad campaign , which ran under the slogan , “ do you love children more than they want you to ? ”
ninety men were accepted for the initial round of therapy .
on wednesday , researchers said 20 men had successfully completed the therapy so far .
now , 45 men with either a history of child-molestation or an urge to do so , are waiting for a slot in a group slated to start in autumn .
but they may be waiting in vain .
the project is in danger of folding for lack of funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day at the park should be worry-free the idea behind the novel project is aimed at preventing child molestation .
the therapy , developed at the charite clinic , has been co-funded by the child-victim rights group hansel & gretel foundation , and the volkswagen foundation .
no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .
people who took part in the study were promised anonymity .
the message given to the patients was , “ you aren ’ t to blame for your sexual desires , but you are responsible for your sexual actions , ” beier said .
learning what children really want a key part of the course , described by the charite as unique world-wide , is to teach the potential pedophiles , through role-playing , to understand the child 's view and that they only imagined children were offering sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of those with the urge seem to want to fight it " one aim was to teach the pedophile men to clearly pick up their warning signals .
for example these could be thinking about a child often , giving a child presents or inviting a child over , " one therapist , david goecker , told dpa news service .
the men were better able to control their urges after the course of treatment , according to the researchers .
in severe cases , impulse-curbing drugs were prescribed , to improve behavior controls .
there is no guarantee the patients would not molest children in the future , " but we can reduce the risk , " said goecker .
funding is threatened despite the high demand and apparent successes , however , the future of the project is in danger .
the volkswagen foundation has said it would only continue its financing of the project if additional sponsors can be found , hansel & gretel ’ s ceo jerome braun told news agencies .
hansel & gretel chairwoman barbara schäfer-wiegand called upon the german federal ministry for education and research , as well as private donors and foundations , to lend their support to the therapy research . # b # one percent of german men are thought to have pedophilic tendencies , schäfer-wiegand said .
these people need to be exposed to therapy “ before thoughts turn to action . ”
' dark field ' outside the law per year , some 15,000 cases of child sex abuse are reported in germany , but the number of unreported cases is thought to be about four times that .
the project ’ s official name is the dark field prevention project : “ dark field ” standing for the shadowy area outside the legal system where potential child molesters lurk .
the project is aimed at three groups of people : men who have never assaulted a child but fear they may ; men who have already molested a child but were never charged , and those who where charged and completed their sentences , but who fear a relapse . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 31.05.2007 finland to ban smoking in bars and restaurants on june 1 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu countries have already banned smoking on friday , finland is to become the latest european nation to ban smoking in bars and restaurants , a measure that is expected to be introduced fairly painlessly in the tobacco-critical state . finland already banned smoking in public places in 1977 and in workplaces in 1995 , leaving bars and restaurants as the only sanctuary until now .
according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "
a eurobarometer poll also showed that the complete ban on smoking in all public places is supported by 96 percent of finns , a higher figure than in the rest of europe .
latest attempts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relegated to the outdoors the latest ban is finland 's second bid at prohibiting smoking in bars and restaurants following a failed 1999 attempt .
" back then restaurant owners were very much against it , " simonen said .
" when we prepared the new legislation -lrb- this time -rrb- , we worked together with employers and unions and have reached a consensus . "
bars , cafés and restaurants larger than 50 square meters -lrb- 164 square feet -rrb- with a proper ventilation system can , during a two-year transition period , set up special smoking sections covering half the size of the premises .
in smaller establishments , cigarettes will be prohibited altogether or smoking rooms will have to be built .
the room can not let out any smoke and customers are not allowed to eat or drink in the special booths .
establishments failing to comply with the new law risk a fine as do smokers disobeying the law .
setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .
but the only european nation to meet that target so far is sweden , where 18 percent of people smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland wants to make smoking less " cool " among younth finland is not far behind .
according to the department for promotion of welfare and health , 22 percent of finns smoke , or 24 percent of men and 19 percent of women .
according to simonen " the minimum goal is to go under 20 percent . "
but the nordic state still has some way to go before reaching former prime minister paavo lipponen 's goal of a " zero smoking " population .
he also proposed banning all tobacco products in finland by 2040 .
" a ban would clearly outline the tobacco policy , " lipponen said .
" at the same time it would discourage young people from smoking . "
ireland was the first european state to introduce a complete ban on smoking in public places in march 2004 .
since then norway , italy , malta , sweden , scotland , latvia and lithuania have followed suit .
wales introduced a ban on april 2 , followed by northern ireland on april 30 .
belgium , denmark , england , france , germany , greece , iceland and romania also have similar plans . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's federal states agree smoking ban with exceptions germany 's federal states agreed thursday to ban smoking in restaurants and pubs , but allowed exceptions for small bars and premises with extra smoking rooms .

" one has to wonder if you 're really concerned about greenhouse gas emissions why you are n't interested in nuclear power , " she told reporters at the end of a meeting of g8 foreign ministers in the eastern german city of potsdam .

" we 're seeking to achieve if not agreement then at least a closing of a gap between us .
it 's not an easy issue , " he said .
" as europeans we are coming closer together on setting limits and benchmarks .
other people are banking on technological solutions .

some 550 people responded to the ad campaign , which ran under the slogan , “ do you love children more than they want you to ? ”
ninety men were accepted for the initial round of therapy .
on wednesday , researchers said 20 men had successfully completed the therapy so far .
now , 45 men with either a history of child-molestation or an urge to do so , are waiting for a slot in a group slated to start in autumn .
but they may be waiting in vain .
the project is in danger of folding for lack of funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day at the park should be worry-free the idea behind the novel project is aimed at preventing child molestation .
the therapy , developed at the charite clinic , has been co-funded by the child-victim rights group hansel & gretel foundation , and the volkswagen foundation .
no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .
people who took part in the study were promised anonymity .
the message given to the patients was , “ you aren ’ t to blame for your sexual desires , but you are responsible for your sexual actions , ” beier said .
learning what children really want a key part of the course , described by the charite as unique world-wide , is to teach the potential pedophiles , through role-playing , to understand the child 's view and that they only imagined children were offering sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of those with the urge seem to want to fight it " one aim was to teach the pedophile men to clearly pick up their warning signals .
for example these could be thinking about a child often , giving a child presents or inviting a child over , " one therapist , david goecker , told dpa news service .
the men were better able to control their urges after the course of treatment , according to the researchers .
in severe cases , impulse-curbing drugs were prescribed , to improve behavior controls .
there is no guarantee the patients would not molest children in the future , " but we can reduce the risk , " said goecker .
funding is threatened despite the high demand and apparent successes , however , the future of the project is in danger .
the volkswagen foundation has said it would only continue its financing of the project if additional sponsors can be found , hansel & gretel ’ s ceo jerome braun told news agencies .
hansel & gretel chairwoman barbara schäfer-wiegand called upon the german federal ministry for education and research , as well as private donors and foundations , to lend their support to the therapy research . # b # one percent of german men are thought to have pedophilic tendencies , schäfer-wiegand said .
these people need to be exposed to therapy “ before thoughts turn to action . ”
' dark field ' outside the law per year , some 15,000 cases of child sex abuse are reported in germany , but the number of unreported cases is thought to be about four times that .
the project ’ s official name is the dark field prevention project : “ dark field ” standing for the shadowy area outside the legal system where potential child molesters lurk .
the project is aimed at three groups of people : men who have never assaulted a child but fear they may ; men who have already molested a child but were never charged , and those who where charged and completed their sentences , but who fear a relapse . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

some 550 people responded to the ad campaign , which ran under the slogan , “ do you love children more than they want you to ? ”
ninety men were accepted for the initial round of therapy .
on wednesday , researchers said 20 men had successfully completed the therapy so far .
now , 45 men with either a history of child-molestation or an urge to do so , are waiting for a slot in a group slated to start in autumn .
but they may be waiting in vain .
the project is in danger of folding for lack of funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day at the park should be worry-free the idea behind the novel project is aimed at preventing child molestation .
the therapy , developed at the charite clinic , has been co-funded by the child-victim rights group hansel & gretel foundation , and the volkswagen foundation .
no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .
people who took part in the study were promised anonymity .
the message given to the patients was , “ you aren ’ t to blame for your sexual desires , but you are responsible for your sexual actions , ” beier said .
learning what children really want a key part of the course , described by the charite as unique world-wide , is to teach the potential pedophiles , through role-playing , to understand the child 's view and that they only imagined children were offering sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of those with the urge seem to want to fight it " one aim was to teach the pedophile men to clearly pick up their warning signals .
for example these could be thinking about a child often , giving a child presents or inviting a child over , " one therapist , david goecker , told dpa news service .
the men were better able to control their urges after the course of treatment , according to the researchers .
in severe cases , impulse-curbing drugs were prescribed , to improve behavior controls .
there is no guarantee the patients would not molest children in the future , " but we can reduce the risk , " said goecker .
funding is threatened despite the high demand and apparent successes , however , the future of the project is in danger .
the volkswagen foundation has said it would only continue its financing of the project if additional sponsors can be found , hansel & gretel ’ s ceo jerome braun told news agencies .
hansel & gretel chairwoman barbara schäfer-wiegand called upon the german federal ministry for education and research , as well as private donors and foundations , to lend their support to the therapy research . # b # one percent of german men are thought to have pedophilic tendencies , schäfer-wiegand said .
these people need to be exposed to therapy “ before thoughts turn to action . ”
' dark field ' outside the law per year , some 15,000 cases of child sex abuse are reported in germany , but the number of unreported cases is thought to be about four times that .
the project ’ s official name is the dark field prevention project : “ dark field ” standing for the shadowy area outside the legal system where potential child molesters lurk .
the project is aimed at three groups of people : men who have never assaulted a child but fear they may ; men who have already molested a child but were never charged , and those who where charged and completed their sentences , but who fear a relapse . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

" merkel said that while she could make only a " brief assessment , " bush 's remarks were an " important step on the road " to the g8 summit next week in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .
" what is positive is that we can see from the speech given by president bush today that no one can get past climate change , " merkel said .
" it is there .
it is also essentially caused by humankind . "
" that is the shared basis on which we are now acting , " merkel said , although she acknowledged much work had to be done .
the german chancellor also stressed that it was " very important to bring the un into the process .
" but i do see movement on the whole question , " she said .
the united states signed the 1997 un-backed kyoto protocol to limit the emission of greenhouse gases - one of the major causes of global warming - but never ratified the treaty .
a new framework bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush kept quiet on details of the plan in a speech in washington setting out his agenda for the g8 summit , bush said the united states " will work with other nations to establish a new framework on greenhouse gas emissions for when the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 . "
he gave , however , few details and made no mention of mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions such as those contained in the kyoto protocol .
under the us proposal , nations would also develop " mid-term national targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs , " bush said .
the us has argued that it favors using technology to fight global warming rather than imposing emissions limits which could hamper economic growth .
limiting emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will g8 leaders reach agreement behind the fence ?
merkel , on the other hand , has staked germany 's 12-month g8 presidency on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases .
the prospects of that happening at the g8 summit in heiligendamm on the baltic coast appear increasingly slim , with clear differences appearing between g8 nations on how to limit greenhouse gases .
washington has strong objections to the proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for the summit , according to leaked documents .
british prime minister tony blair , however , called bush 's announcement tackling climate change a " big step forward .
" this is what we have been working for , " blair said .
" obviously it 's a big step forward and it sets the right framework for next week 's meeting . "
the g8 summit will be attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
research and development the us president said he would push g8 leaders to boost investment in research and development of environment-friendly technologies , and would help poor countries acquire such cutting-edge science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush banks on clean energy technologies " we 're also going to work to conclude talks with other nations on eliminating tariffs and other barriers to clean energy technologies and services by the end of this year , " he said .
" we 'll help the world 's poorest nations reduce emissions by giving them government-developed technologies at low cost or in some case no cost at all , " said the us president .
amid early media reports of bush 's plan , greenpeace spokesman jörg feddern criticized the proposal as an attempt to undermine the united nations ' kyoto process with its mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions .
" this is fatal for climate protection , " feddern told afp .
the role of emerging economies under the kyoto procotol , 35 industrialized nations that have signed and ratified the pact are required to make targeted cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china so far fails to accept binding targets china and india 's status as developing nations exempts them from mandatory targets on greenhouse gas output , though they are fast becoming big emitters of greenhouse gases as they burn oil , gas and coal to power their economies .
the us administration has cited this as a reason for not submitting the protocol for ratification by the senate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 31.05.2007 telecom market overhaul to affect germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jajah combines voip with traditional telephones german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is investing heftily in internet telephony provider jajah .
experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .
" you have to be really well positioned in this business , " welfens said .

" merkel said that while she could make only a " brief assessment , " bush 's remarks were an " important step on the road " to the g8 summit next week in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .
" what is positive is that we can see from the speech given by president bush today that no one can get past climate change , " merkel said .
" it is there .
it is also essentially caused by humankind . "
" that is the shared basis on which we are now acting , " merkel said , although she acknowledged much work had to be done .
the german chancellor also stressed that it was " very important to bring the un into the process .
" but i do see movement on the whole question , " she said .
the united states signed the 1997 un-backed kyoto protocol to limit the emission of greenhouse gases - one of the major causes of global warming - but never ratified the treaty .
a new framework bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush kept quiet on details of the plan in a speech in washington setting out his agenda for the g8 summit , bush said the united states " will work with other nations to establish a new framework on greenhouse gas emissions for when the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 . "
he gave , however , few details and made no mention of mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions such as those contained in the kyoto protocol .
under the us proposal , nations would also develop " mid-term national targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs , " bush said .
the us has argued that it favors using technology to fight global warming rather than imposing emissions limits which could hamper economic growth .
limiting emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will g8 leaders reach agreement behind the fence ?
merkel , on the other hand , has staked germany 's 12-month g8 presidency on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases .
the prospects of that happening at the g8 summit in heiligendamm on the baltic coast appear increasingly slim , with clear differences appearing between g8 nations on how to limit greenhouse gases .
washington has strong objections to the proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for the summit , according to leaked documents .
british prime minister tony blair , however , called bush 's announcement tackling climate change a " big step forward .
" this is what we have been working for , " blair said .

" we 'll help the world 's poorest nations reduce emissions by giving them government-developed technologies at low cost or in some case no cost at all , " said the us president .
amid early media reports of bush 's plan , greenpeace spokesman jörg feddern criticized the proposal as an attempt to undermine the united nations ' kyoto process with its mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions .

according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "
a eurobarometer poll also showed that the complete ban on smoking in all public places is supported by 96 percent of finns , a higher figure than in the rest of europe .
latest attempts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relegated to the outdoors the latest ban is finland 's second bid at prohibiting smoking in bars and restaurants following a failed 1999 attempt .
" back then restaurant owners were very much against it , " simonen said .
" when we prepared the new legislation -lrb- this time -rrb- , we worked together with employers and unions and have reached a consensus . "
bars , cafés and restaurants larger than 50 square meters -lrb- 164 square feet -rrb- with a proper ventilation system can , during a two-year transition period , set up special smoking sections covering half the size of the premises .
in smaller establishments , cigarettes will be prohibited altogether or smoking rooms will have to be built .
the room can not let out any smoke and customers are not allowed to eat or drink in the special booths .
establishments failing to comply with the new law risk a fine as do smokers disobeying the law .
setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .
but the only european nation to meet that target so far is sweden , where 18 percent of people smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland wants to make smoking less " cool " among younth finland is not far behind .
according to the department for promotion of welfare and health , 22 percent of finns smoke , or 24 percent of men and 19 percent of women .
according to simonen " the minimum goal is to go under 20 percent . "
but the nordic state still has some way to go before reaching former prime minister paavo lipponen 's goal of a " zero smoking " population .
he also proposed banning all tobacco products in finland by 2040 .
" a ban would clearly outline the tobacco policy , " lipponen said .
" at the same time it would discourage young people from smoking . "
ireland was the first european state to introduce a complete ban on smoking in public places in march 2004 .
since then norway , italy , malta , sweden , scotland , latvia and lithuania have followed suit .
wales introduced a ban on april 2 , followed by northern ireland on april 30 .

according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "
a eurobarometer poll also showed that the complete ban on smoking in all public places is supported by 96 percent of finns , a higher figure than in the rest of europe .
latest attempts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relegated to the outdoors the latest ban is finland 's second bid at prohibiting smoking in bars and restaurants following a failed 1999 attempt .
" back then restaurant owners were very much against it , " simonen said .
" when we prepared the new legislation -lrb- this time -rrb- , we worked together with employers and unions and have reached a consensus . "
bars , cafés and restaurants larger than 50 square meters -lrb- 164 square feet -rrb- with a proper ventilation system can , during a two-year transition period , set up special smoking sections covering half the size of the premises .
in smaller establishments , cigarettes will be prohibited altogether or smoking rooms will have to be built .
the room can not let out any smoke and customers are not allowed to eat or drink in the special booths .
establishments failing to comply with the new law risk a fine as do smokers disobeying the law .
setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .
but the only european nation to meet that target so far is sweden , where 18 percent of people smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland wants to make smoking less " cool " among younth finland is not far behind .
according to the department for promotion of welfare and health , 22 percent of finns smoke , or 24 percent of men and 19 percent of women .
according to simonen " the minimum goal is to go under 20 percent . "
but the nordic state still has some way to go before reaching former prime minister paavo lipponen 's goal of a " zero smoking " population .
he also proposed banning all tobacco products in finland by 2040 .
" a ban would clearly outline the tobacco policy , " lipponen said .
" at the same time it would discourage young people from smoking . "
ireland was the first european state to introduce a complete ban on smoking in public places in march 2004 .

according to raw , unadjusted data published by the federal labor agency in nuremberg , the german jobless rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 9.1 percent in may , the lowest level since october 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mild weather is beneficial for the construction industry the overall jobless total declined by 161,000 to 3.806 million , the lowest number of dole-claimers in germany since november 2001 , the figures showed .
unemployment usually falls in the spring thanks to the warmer weather , which is favorable to sectors such as the construction industry .
labor market helped by warm weather adjusted for such seasonal effects , the jobless rate held steady at 9.2 percent , the lowest level since may 2001 , while the adjusted jobless total rose slightly by 3,000 to 3.855 million .
the small upward blip was unexpected - analysts had been penciling in a decline in the adjusted jobless total of around 12,000 this month - but was largely due to the unusually mild winter , which had caused fewer companies to lay off workers during the preceding months , as well as the heavy rain seen this month , analysts said .
" the economic upturn in germany is continuing apace and is helping to stimulate the labor market , " insisted labor office chief frank weise .
weise suggested that the unadjusted jobless total could fall below 3.5 million by the autumn , with the annual average total for the whole of 2007 likely to come out at 3.8-3.9 million .
analysts were similarly unfazed by the slight rise in the adjusted may jobless total this month .
" surveys of hiring intentions remain consistent with solid employment growth so the may figures may have been adversely affected by special factors such as the rainy weather , which has probably hurt activity in retail sales and construction , " said bnp paribas economist , caroline newhouse-cohen .
" all in all , we assume that there is still some scope for further employment growth and decreasing unemployment over the coming months , " the analyst said .
all the right indicators in place indeed , key confidence surveys such as the zew and widely-watched ifo indices suggested that germany , among all the euro-area economies , was likely to prove most resilient to the strong euro , rising interest rates and the slowdown in growth in the united states , newhouse-cohen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines are getting shorter at german labor offices investor confidence , as measured by the monthly zew index , hit an 11-month high in may , while the ifo business climate index held steady just a fraction off its all-time high .
dekabank economist peter leonhardt similarly believed that the upturn on the german labor market " remains intact .
companies ' order books are full and confidence that the economy will continue to prosper is balm for the wounds of the labor market . "
bank of america economist holger schmieding said that the jobless data so far this year had likely been distorted by the unusually mild weather and a new seasonal program to keep people off the dole in the winter .
nevertheless , " the underlying trend in the labor market remains solid , " schmieding said .
" taking the last six months together , unemployment has fallen by a monthly average of 59,000 .
we consider this the underlying trend , which should soon be visible in the headline data again , " he said .
ixis-cib economist sylvain broyer predicted that the jobless figures may move sideways for a few months .
" but we expect the unemployment rate to decline in trend until mid-2008 as the recovery proves to be robust .
indeed , the jobless rate could reach 8.8 percent by the end of this year , " broyer suggested . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reports biggest tax surplus in modern history germany says it expects its biggest tax surplus for half a century as the economy once derided as the " sick man of europe " reaps the benefits from buoyant growth and moderate reforms .

according to raw , unadjusted data published by the federal labor agency in nuremberg , the german jobless rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 9.1 percent in may , the lowest level since october 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mild weather is beneficial for the construction industry the overall jobless total declined by 161,000 to 3.806 million , the lowest number of dole-claimers in germany since november 2001 , the figures showed .
unemployment usually falls in the spring thanks to the warmer weather , which is favorable to sectors such as the construction industry .
labor market helped by warm weather adjusted for such seasonal effects , the jobless rate held steady at 9.2 percent , the lowest level since may 2001 , while the adjusted jobless total rose slightly by 3,000 to 3.855 million .
the small upward blip was unexpected - analysts had been penciling in a decline in the adjusted jobless total of around 12,000 this month - but was largely due to the unusually mild winter , which had caused fewer companies to lay off workers during the preceding months , as well as the heavy rain seen this month , analysts said .
" the economic upturn in germany is continuing apace and is helping to stimulate the labor market , " insisted labor office chief frank weise .
weise suggested that the unadjusted jobless total could fall below 3.5 million by the autumn , with the annual average total for the whole of 2007 likely to come out at 3.8-3.9 million .
analysts were similarly unfazed by the slight rise in the adjusted may jobless total this month .
" surveys of hiring intentions remain consistent with solid employment growth so the may figures may have been adversely affected by special factors such as the rainy weather , which has probably hurt activity in retail sales and construction , " said bnp paribas economist , caroline newhouse-cohen .
" all in all , we assume that there is still some scope for further employment growth and decreasing unemployment over the coming months , " the analyst said .
all the right indicators in place indeed , key confidence surveys such as the zew and widely-watched ifo indices suggested that germany , among all the euro-area economies , was likely to prove most resilient to the strong euro , rising interest rates and the slowdown in growth in the united states , newhouse-cohen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines are getting shorter at german labor offices investor confidence , as measured by the monthly zew index , hit an 11-month high in may , while the ifo business climate index held steady just a fraction off its all-time high .
dekabank economist peter leonhardt similarly believed that the upturn on the german labor market " remains intact .
companies ' order books are full and confidence that the economy will continue to prosper is balm for the wounds of the labor market . "
bank of america economist holger schmieding said that the jobless data so far this year had likely been distorted by the unusually mild weather and a new seasonal program to keep people off the dole in the winter .
nevertheless , " the underlying trend in the labor market remains solid , " schmieding said .
" taking the last six months together , unemployment has fallen by a monthly average of 59,000 .
we consider this the underlying trend , which should soon be visible in the headline data again , " he said .
ixis-cib economist sylvain broyer predicted that the jobless figures may move sideways for a few months .
" but we expect the unemployment rate to decline in trend until mid-2008 as the recovery proves to be robust .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de psychology -pipe- 31.05.2007 german pedophilia project touts results , pleads for funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a berlin project has taken aim at preventing child molestation a controversial project aimed at preventing pedophiles from acting on their sexual urges risks being shut down for lack of funds , despite reported success with its first group of patients . berlin ’ s charite clinic hospital shocked germans in 2005 when it advertised for potential child molesters to take part in an experimental behavioral therapy , known as prevention project dark field .
some 550 people responded to the ad campaign , which ran under the slogan , “ do you love children more than they want you to ? ”
ninety men were accepted for the initial round of therapy .
on wednesday , researchers said 20 men had successfully completed the therapy so far .
now , 45 men with either a history of child-molestation or an urge to do so , are waiting for a slot in a group slated to start in autumn .
but they may be waiting in vain .
the project is in danger of folding for lack of funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day at the park should be worry-free the idea behind the novel project is aimed at preventing child molestation .
the therapy , developed at the charite clinic , has been co-funded by the child-victim rights group hansel & gretel foundation , and the volkswagen foundation .
no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .

some 550 people responded to the ad campaign , which ran under the slogan , “ do you love children more than they want you to ? ”
ninety men were accepted for the initial round of therapy .
on wednesday , researchers said 20 men had successfully completed the therapy so far .
now , 45 men with either a history of child-molestation or an urge to do so , are waiting for a slot in a group slated to start in autumn .
but they may be waiting in vain .
the project is in danger of folding for lack of funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day at the park should be worry-free the idea behind the novel project is aimed at preventing child molestation .
the therapy , developed at the charite clinic , has been co-funded by the child-victim rights group hansel & gretel foundation , and the volkswagen foundation .
no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .
people who took part in the study were promised anonymity .
the message given to the patients was , “ you aren ’ t to blame for your sexual desires , but you are responsible for your sexual actions , ” beier said .
learning what children really want a key part of the course , described by the charite as unique world-wide , is to teach the potential pedophiles , through role-playing , to understand the child 's view and that they only imagined children were offering sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of those with the urge seem to want to fight it " one aim was to teach the pedophile men to clearly pick up their warning signals .
for example these could be thinking about a child often , giving a child presents or inviting a child over , " one therapist , david goecker , told dpa news service .
the men were better able to control their urges after the course of treatment , according to the researchers .
in severe cases , impulse-curbing drugs were prescribed , to improve behavior controls .
there is no guarantee the patients would not molest children in the future , " but we can reduce the risk , " said goecker .
funding is threatened despite the high demand and apparent successes , however , the future of the project is in danger .
the volkswagen foundation has said it would only continue its financing of the project if additional sponsors can be found , hansel & gretel ’ s ceo jerome braun told news agencies .
hansel & gretel chairwoman barbara schäfer-wiegand called upon the german federal ministry for education and research , as well as private donors and foundations , to lend their support to the therapy research . # b # one percent of german men are thought to have pedophilic tendencies , schäfer-wiegand said .
these people need to be exposed to therapy “ before thoughts turn to action . ”
' dark field ' outside the law per year , some 15,000 cases of child sex abuse are reported in germany , but the number of unreported cases is thought to be about four times that .
the project ’ s official name is the dark field prevention project : “ dark field ” standing for the shadowy area outside the legal system where potential child molesters lurk .
the project is aimed at three groups of people : men who have never assaulted a child but fear they may ; men who have already molested a child but were never charged , and those who where charged and completed their sentences , but who fear a relapse . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 31.05.2007 finland to ban smoking in bars and restaurants on june 1 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu countries have already banned smoking on friday , finland is to become the latest european nation to ban smoking in bars and restaurants , a measure that is expected to be introduced fairly painlessly in the tobacco-critical state . finland already banned smoking in public places in 1977 and in workplaces in 1995 , leaving bars and restaurants as the only sanctuary until now .
according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "
a eurobarometer poll also showed that the complete ban on smoking in all public places is supported by 96 percent of finns , a higher figure than in the rest of europe .
latest attempts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relegated to the outdoors the latest ban is finland 's second bid at prohibiting smoking in bars and restaurants following a failed 1999 attempt .
" back then restaurant owners were very much against it , " simonen said .
" when we prepared the new legislation -lrb- this time -rrb- , we worked together with employers and unions and have reached a consensus . "
bars , cafés and restaurants larger than 50 square meters -lrb- 164 square feet -rrb- with a proper ventilation system can , during a two-year transition period , set up special smoking sections covering half the size of the premises .
in smaller establishments , cigarettes will be prohibited altogether or smoking rooms will have to be built .
the room can not let out any smoke and customers are not allowed to eat or drink in the special booths .
establishments failing to comply with the new law risk a fine as do smokers disobeying the law .
setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .
but the only european nation to meet that target so far is sweden , where 18 percent of people smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland wants to make smoking less " cool " among younth finland is not far behind .
according to the department for promotion of welfare and health , 22 percent of finns smoke , or 24 percent of men and 19 percent of women .

experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .

experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .
" you have to be really well positioned in this business , " welfens said .

" merkel said that while she could make only a " brief assessment , " bush 's remarks were an " important step on the road " to the g8 summit next week in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .
" what is positive is that we can see from the speech given by president bush today that no one can get past climate change , " merkel said .
" it is there .
it is also essentially caused by humankind . "
" that is the shared basis on which we are now acting , " merkel said , although she acknowledged much work had to be done .
the german chancellor also stressed that it was " very important to bring the un into the process .
" but i do see movement on the whole question , " she said .
the united states signed the 1997 un-backed kyoto protocol to limit the emission of greenhouse gases - one of the major causes of global warming - but never ratified the treaty .
a new framework bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush kept quiet on details of the plan in a speech in washington setting out his agenda for the g8 summit , bush said the united states " will work with other nations to establish a new framework on greenhouse gas emissions for when the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 . "
he gave , however , few details and made no mention of mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions such as those contained in the kyoto protocol .
under the us proposal , nations would also develop " mid-term national targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs , " bush said .
the us has argued that it favors using technology to fight global warming rather than imposing emissions limits which could hamper economic growth .
limiting emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will g8 leaders reach agreement behind the fence ?
merkel , on the other hand , has staked germany 's 12-month g8 presidency on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases .
the prospects of that happening at the g8 summit in heiligendamm on the baltic coast appear increasingly slim , with clear differences appearing between g8 nations on how to limit greenhouse gases .
washington has strong objections to the proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for the summit , according to leaked documents .
british prime minister tony blair , however , called bush 's announcement tackling climate change a " big step forward .
" this is what we have been working for , " blair said .
" obviously it 's a big step forward and it sets the right framework for next week 's meeting . "
the g8 summit will be attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
research and development the us president said he would push g8 leaders to boost investment in research and development of environment-friendly technologies , and would help poor countries acquire such cutting-edge science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush banks on clean energy technologies " we 're also going to work to conclude talks with other nations on eliminating tariffs and other barriers to clean energy technologies and services by the end of this year , " he said .
" we 'll help the world 's poorest nations reduce emissions by giving them government-developed technologies at low cost or in some case no cost at all , " said the us president .
amid early media reports of bush 's plan , greenpeace spokesman jörg feddern criticized the proposal as an attempt to undermine the united nations ' kyoto process with its mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions .
" this is fatal for climate protection , " feddern told afp .
the role of emerging economies under the kyoto procotol , 35 industrialized nations that have signed and ratified the pact are required to make targeted cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china so far fails to accept binding targets china and india 's status as developing nations exempts them from mandatory targets on greenhouse gas output , though they are fast becoming big emitters of greenhouse gases as they burn oil , gas and coal to power their economies .
the us administration has cited this as a reason for not submitting the protocol for ratification by the senate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 31.05.2007 telecom market overhaul to affect germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jajah combines voip with traditional telephones german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is investing heftily in internet telephony provider jajah .
experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .
" you have to be really well positioned in this business , " welfens said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moma in berlin " was a real crowd magnet some 1.2 million people flocked to see the hugely successful exhibition .
this time , the debonair art connoisseur secured a five-month loan of some 150 french 19th century art masterpieces belonging to the metropolitan museum of art on new york 's fifth avenue .
paintings by ingres , corot , courbet , puvis de chavannes , manet , degas , pissarro , monet , cezanne , gauguin , bonnard and matisse as well as sculptures by rodin and maillol will go on display at the neue nationalgalerie in berlin from june 1 to oct .
7 .
berlin 's " most beautiful french " exhibition is highlighted by five magnificent paintings by cezanne , eleven by courbet , 12 by degas , and seven by manet .
special halls are dedicated to the work of monet and degas .
nine sculptures by august rodin will also be on view , among them his spectacular " burghers of calais . "
foundations of modernity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the birth of venus " by alexandre cabanel the metropolitan museum of art has long boasted the largest and most significant permanent collection of 19th century french art alongside the musee d 'orsay in paris .
with france being the undisputed center of artistic development in the 19th century , the creations of that time laid the foundations of modernity as it dawned before the turn of the century .
monumental highlights of this epoch , such as ingres ' " odalisque in grisaille , " courbet 's " woman with a parrot , " manet 's " boating " , degas ' " the dance class " , monet 's " la grenouillere , " gauguin 's " la orana maria / hail mary " and rodin 's touching sculptures are all brought together for the first time in berlin at the exhibition .
permission to travel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rodin 's " adam " normally , the met 's prize french works are never allowed to leave the new york museum .
an exception was made by phillipe de montebello , the chief of the met , when plans were drafted for the renovation and enlargement of the 19th century galleries housing the museum 's european collections this summer .
this enabled the stunning collection of french art works to be sent to berlin .
curiously , berlin 's 2004 " moma " exhibition also came about in similar fashion , after the museum of modern art decided its premises also needed enlarging .
raue , a lawyer and the chairman of the city 's " friends of the national gallery foundation " has long enjoyed close collaborative ties with both the met and the museum of modern art in new york .
" we provide each other with generous loans , " raue said .
" we cooperate on exhibitions and both the directors and curators of the two museums know and respect each other . "
crowds expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition is expected to draw large crowds this latest major berlin exhibition is expected to draw huge crowds .
weeks before the official opening , 500 planned guided tours of the exhibition were fully booked out , and 1,500 first-day vip tickets snapped up .
a supplementary french exhibition is now also being staged at the alte nationalgalerie on the city 's museum island .
this museum was the first in germany to take a serious look at french impressionist painting .
already in 1896 , it had acquired a noted work by eduard manet titled " in the wintergarten . "
other paintings by monet , renoir , degas , cezanne and rodin would follow .
violet-colored pigs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " odalisque in grisaille " by jean auguste dominique ingres hugo von tschudi , who was the director of the nationalgalerie from 1896 to 1908 , had an often stormy relationship with german monarch kaiser wilhelm ii over his interest in french impressionist painting .
" please , no violet-colored pigs , " barked the kaiser when von tschudi first met him to talk about art acquisitions in 1896 .
von tschudi , who refused to be brow-beaten , would later establish contact with paul durand-ruel , a paris impressionist art dealer , from whom he secured not only manet 's noted " wintergarten " , but also works by courbet , monet , cezanne and degas for the alte nationalgalerie .
their art clashes later came to a head when the kaiser insisted all art gifts from wealthy patrons must from then on be agreed with him .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moma in berlin " was a real crowd magnet some 1.2 million people flocked to see the hugely successful exhibition .
this time , the debonair art connoisseur secured a five-month loan of some 150 french 19th century art masterpieces belonging to the metropolitan museum of art on new york 's fifth avenue .
paintings by ingres , corot , courbet , puvis de chavannes , manet , degas , pissarro , monet , cezanne , gauguin , bonnard and matisse as well as sculptures by rodin and maillol will go on display at the neue nationalgalerie in berlin from june 1 to oct .
7 .
berlin 's " most beautiful french " exhibition is highlighted by five magnificent paintings by cezanne , eleven by courbet , 12 by degas , and seven by manet .
special halls are dedicated to the work of monet and degas .
nine sculptures by august rodin will also be on view , among them his spectacular " burghers of calais . "
foundations of modernity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the birth of venus " by alexandre cabanel the metropolitan museum of art has long boasted the largest and most significant permanent collection of 19th century french art alongside the musee d 'orsay in paris .
with france being the undisputed center of artistic development in the 19th century , the creations of that time laid the foundations of modernity as it dawned before the turn of the century .
monumental highlights of this epoch , such as ingres ' " odalisque in grisaille , " courbet 's " woman with a parrot , " manet 's " boating " , degas ' " the dance class " , monet 's " la grenouillere , " gauguin 's " la orana maria / hail mary " and rodin 's touching sculptures are all brought together for the first time in berlin at the exhibition .
permission to travel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rodin 's " adam " normally , the met 's prize french works are never allowed to leave the new york museum .
an exception was made by phillipe de montebello , the chief of the met , when plans were drafted for the renovation and enlargement of the 19th century galleries housing the museum 's european collections this summer .
this enabled the stunning collection of french art works to be sent to berlin .
curiously , berlin 's 2004 " moma " exhibition also came about in similar fashion , after the museum of modern art decided its premises also needed enlarging .
raue , a lawyer and the chairman of the city 's " friends of the national gallery foundation " has long enjoyed close collaborative ties with both the met and the museum of modern art in new york .
" we provide each other with generous loans , " raue said .
" we cooperate on exhibitions and both the directors and curators of the two museums know and respect each other . "
crowds expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition is expected to draw large crowds this latest major berlin exhibition is expected to draw huge crowds .
weeks before the official opening , 500 planned guided tours of the exhibition were fully booked out , and 1,500 first-day vip tickets snapped up .
a supplementary french exhibition is now also being staged at the alte nationalgalerie on the city 's museum island .
this museum was the first in germany to take a serious look at french impressionist painting .
already in 1896 , it had acquired a noted work by eduard manet titled " in the wintergarten . "
other paintings by monet , renoir , degas , cezanne and rodin would follow .
violet-colored pigs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " odalisque in grisaille " by jean auguste dominique ingres hugo von tschudi , who was the director of the nationalgalerie from 1896 to 1908 , had an often stormy relationship with german monarch kaiser wilhelm ii over his interest in french impressionist painting .
" please , no violet-colored pigs , " barked the kaiser when von tschudi first met him to talk about art acquisitions in 1896 .
von tschudi , who refused to be brow-beaten , would later establish contact with paul durand-ruel , a paris impressionist art dealer , from whom he secured not only manet 's noted " wintergarten " , but also works by courbet , monet , cezanne and degas for the alte nationalgalerie .
their art clashes later came to a head when the kaiser insisted all art gifts from wealthy patrons must from then on be agreed with him .

according to raw , unadjusted data published by the federal labor agency in nuremberg , the german jobless rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 9.1 percent in may , the lowest level since october 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mild weather is beneficial for the construction industry the overall jobless total declined by 161,000 to 3.806 million , the lowest number of dole-claimers in germany since november 2001 , the figures showed .
unemployment usually falls in the spring thanks to the warmer weather , which is favorable to sectors such as the construction industry .
labor market helped by warm weather adjusted for such seasonal effects , the jobless rate held steady at 9.2 percent , the lowest level since may 2001 , while the adjusted jobless total rose slightly by 3,000 to 3.855 million .
the small upward blip was unexpected - analysts had been penciling in a decline in the adjusted jobless total of around 12,000 this month - but was largely due to the unusually mild winter , which had caused fewer companies to lay off workers during the preceding months , as well as the heavy rain seen this month , analysts said .
" the economic upturn in germany is continuing apace and is helping to stimulate the labor market , " insisted labor office chief frank weise .
weise suggested that the unadjusted jobless total could fall below 3.5 million by the autumn , with the annual average total for the whole of 2007 likely to come out at 3.8-3.9 million .
analysts were similarly unfazed by the slight rise in the adjusted may jobless total this month .
" surveys of hiring intentions remain consistent with solid employment growth so the may figures may have been adversely affected by special factors such as the rainy weather , which has probably hurt activity in retail sales and construction , " said bnp paribas economist , caroline newhouse-cohen .
" all in all , we assume that there is still some scope for further employment growth and decreasing unemployment over the coming months , " the analyst said .
all the right indicators in place indeed , key confidence surveys such as the zew and widely-watched ifo indices suggested that germany , among all the euro-area economies , was likely to prove most resilient to the strong euro , rising interest rates and the slowdown in growth in the united states , newhouse-cohen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines are getting shorter at german labor offices investor confidence , as measured by the monthly zew index , hit an 11-month high in may , while the ifo business climate index held steady just a fraction off its all-time high .
dekabank economist peter leonhardt similarly believed that the upturn on the german labor market " remains intact .
companies ' order books are full and confidence that the economy will continue to prosper is balm for the wounds of the labor market . "
bank of america economist holger schmieding said that the jobless data so far this year had likely been distorted by the unusually mild weather and a new seasonal program to keep people off the dole in the winter .
nevertheless , " the underlying trend in the labor market remains solid , " schmieding said .
" taking the last six months together , unemployment has fallen by a monthly average of 59,000 .
we consider this the underlying trend , which should soon be visible in the headline data again , " he said .
ixis-cib economist sylvain broyer predicted that the jobless figures may move sideways for a few months .

" merkel said that while she could make only a " brief assessment , " bush 's remarks were an " important step on the road " to the g8 summit next week in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .
" what is positive is that we can see from the speech given by president bush today that no one can get past climate change , " merkel said .
" it is there .
it is also essentially caused by humankind . "
" that is the shared basis on which we are now acting , " merkel said , although she acknowledged much work had to be done .
the german chancellor also stressed that it was " very important to bring the un into the process .
" but i do see movement on the whole question , " she said .
the united states signed the 1997 un-backed kyoto protocol to limit the emission of greenhouse gases - one of the major causes of global warming - but never ratified the treaty .
a new framework bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush kept quiet on details of the plan in a speech in washington setting out his agenda for the g8 summit , bush said the united states " will work with other nations to establish a new framework on greenhouse gas emissions for when the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 . "
he gave , however , few details and made no mention of mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions such as those contained in the kyoto protocol .
under the us proposal , nations would also develop " mid-term national targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs , " bush said .
the us has argued that it favors using technology to fight global warming rather than imposing emissions limits which could hamper economic growth .
limiting emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will g8 leaders reach agreement behind the fence ?
merkel , on the other hand , has staked germany 's 12-month g8 presidency on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases .

" merkel said that while she could make only a " brief assessment , " bush 's remarks were an " important step on the road " to the g8 summit next week in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .
" what is positive is that we can see from the speech given by president bush today that no one can get past climate change , " merkel said .
" it is there .
it is also essentially caused by humankind . "
" that is the shared basis on which we are now acting , " merkel said , although she acknowledged much work had to be done .
the german chancellor also stressed that it was " very important to bring the un into the process .
" but i do see movement on the whole question , " she said .
the united states signed the 1997 un-backed kyoto protocol to limit the emission of greenhouse gases - one of the major causes of global warming - but never ratified the treaty .
a new framework bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush kept quiet on details of the plan in a speech in washington setting out his agenda for the g8 summit , bush said the united states " will work with other nations to establish a new framework on greenhouse gas emissions for when the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 . "
he gave , however , few details and made no mention of mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions such as those contained in the kyoto protocol .
under the us proposal , nations would also develop " mid-term national targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs , " bush said .
the us has argued that it favors using technology to fight global warming rather than imposing emissions limits which could hamper economic growth .
limiting emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will g8 leaders reach agreement behind the fence ?
merkel , on the other hand , has staked germany 's 12-month g8 presidency on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases .
the prospects of that happening at the g8 summit in heiligendamm on the baltic coast appear increasingly slim , with clear differences appearing between g8 nations on how to limit greenhouse gases .
washington has strong objections to the proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for the summit , according to leaked documents .
british prime minister tony blair , however , called bush 's announcement tackling climate change a " big step forward .
" this is what we have been working for , " blair said .
" obviously it 's a big step forward and it sets the right framework for next week 's meeting . "
the g8 summit will be attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
research and development the us president said he would push g8 leaders to boost investment in research and development of environment-friendly technologies , and would help poor countries acquire such cutting-edge science .

this enabled the stunning collection of french art works to be sent to berlin .

this museum was the first in germany to take a serious look at french impressionist painting .

" please , no violet-colored pigs , " barked the kaiser when von tschudi first met him to talk about art acquisitions in 1896 .
von tschudi , who refused to be brow-beaten , would later establish contact with paul durand-ruel , a paris impressionist art dealer , from whom he secured not only manet 's noted " wintergarten " , but also works by courbet , monet , cezanne and degas for the alte nationalgalerie .

according to raw , unadjusted data published by the federal labor agency in nuremberg , the german jobless rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 9.1 percent in may , the lowest level since october 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mild weather is beneficial for the construction industry the overall jobless total declined by 161,000 to 3.806 million , the lowest number of dole-claimers in germany since november 2001 , the figures showed .
unemployment usually falls in the spring thanks to the warmer weather , which is favorable to sectors such as the construction industry .
labor market helped by warm weather adjusted for such seasonal effects , the jobless rate held steady at 9.2 percent , the lowest level since may 2001 , while the adjusted jobless total rose slightly by 3,000 to 3.855 million .
the small upward blip was unexpected - analysts had been penciling in a decline in the adjusted jobless total of around 12,000 this month - but was largely due to the unusually mild winter , which had caused fewer companies to lay off workers during the preceding months , as well as the heavy rain seen this month , analysts said .
" the economic upturn in germany is continuing apace and is helping to stimulate the labor market , " insisted labor office chief frank weise .
weise suggested that the unadjusted jobless total could fall below 3.5 million by the autumn , with the annual average total for the whole of 2007 likely to come out at 3.8-3.9 million .
analysts were similarly unfazed by the slight rise in the adjusted may jobless total this month .
" surveys of hiring intentions remain consistent with solid employment growth so the may figures may have been adversely affected by special factors such as the rainy weather , which has probably hurt activity in retail sales and construction , " said bnp paribas economist , caroline newhouse-cohen .
" all in all , we assume that there is still some scope for further employment growth and decreasing unemployment over the coming months , " the analyst said .
all the right indicators in place indeed , key confidence surveys such as the zew and widely-watched ifo indices suggested that germany , among all the euro-area economies , was likely to prove most resilient to the strong euro , rising interest rates and the slowdown in growth in the united states , newhouse-cohen said .

dekabank economist peter leonhardt similarly believed that the upturn on the german labor market " remains intact .
companies ' order books are full and confidence that the economy will continue to prosper is balm for the wounds of the labor market . "
bank of america economist holger schmieding said that the jobless data so far this year had likely been distorted by the unusually mild weather and a new seasonal program to keep people off the dole in the winter .
nevertheless , " the underlying trend in the labor market remains solid , " schmieding said .
" taking the last six months together , unemployment has fallen by a monthly average of 59,000 .
we consider this the underlying trend , which should soon be visible in the headline data again , " he said .
ixis-cib economist sylvain broyer predicted that the jobless figures may move sideways for a few months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 31.05.2007 telecom market overhaul to affect germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jajah combines voip with traditional telephones german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is investing heftily in internet telephony provider jajah .
experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .

experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .

according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "
a eurobarometer poll also showed that the complete ban on smoking in all public places is supported by 96 percent of finns , a higher figure than in the rest of europe .

setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .

according to simonen " the minimum goal is to go under 20 percent . "
but the nordic state still has some way to go before reaching former prime minister paavo lipponen 's goal of a " zero smoking " population .
he also proposed banning all tobacco products in finland by 2040 .

some 550 people responded to the ad campaign , which ran under the slogan , “ do you love children more than they want you to ? ”
ninety men were accepted for the initial round of therapy .
on wednesday , researchers said 20 men had successfully completed the therapy so far .
now , 45 men with either a history of child-molestation or an urge to do so , are waiting for a slot in a group slated to start in autumn .
but they may be waiting in vain .
the project is in danger of folding for lack of funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day at the park should be worry-free the idea behind the novel project is aimed at preventing child molestation .
the therapy , developed at the charite clinic , has been co-funded by the child-victim rights group hansel & gretel foundation , and the volkswagen foundation .
no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .
people who took part in the study were promised anonymity .
the message given to the patients was , “ you aren ’ t to blame for your sexual desires , but you are responsible for your sexual actions , ” beier said .
learning what children really want a key part of the course , described by the charite as unique world-wide , is to teach the potential pedophiles , through role-playing , to understand the child 's view and that they only imagined children were offering sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of those with the urge seem to want to fight it " one aim was to teach the pedophile men to clearly pick up their warning signals .
for example these could be thinking about a child often , giving a child presents or inviting a child over , " one therapist , david goecker , told dpa news service .
the men were better able to control their urges after the course of treatment , according to the researchers .
in severe cases , impulse-curbing drugs were prescribed , to improve behavior controls .
there is no guarantee the patients would not molest children in the future , " but we can reduce the risk , " said goecker .
funding is threatened despite the high demand and apparent successes , however , the future of the project is in danger .
the volkswagen foundation has said it would only continue its financing of the project if additional sponsors can be found , hansel & gretel ’ s ceo jerome braun told news agencies .
hansel & gretel chairwoman barbara schäfer-wiegand called upon the german federal ministry for education and research , as well as private donors and foundations , to lend their support to the therapy research . # b # one percent of german men are thought to have pedophilic tendencies , schäfer-wiegand said .
these people need to be exposed to therapy “ before thoughts turn to action . ”
' dark field ' outside the law per year , some 15,000 cases of child sex abuse are reported in germany , but the number of unreported cases is thought to be about four times that .
the project ’ s official name is the dark field prevention project : “ dark field ” standing for the shadowy area outside the legal system where potential child molesters lurk .
the project is aimed at three groups of people : men who have never assaulted a child but fear they may ; men who have already molested a child but were never charged , and those who where charged and completed their sentences , but who fear a relapse . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

some 550 people responded to the ad campaign , which ran under the slogan , “ do you love children more than they want you to ? ”
ninety men were accepted for the initial round of therapy .
on wednesday , researchers said 20 men had successfully completed the therapy so far .
now , 45 men with either a history of child-molestation or an urge to do so , are waiting for a slot in a group slated to start in autumn .
but they may be waiting in vain .
the project is in danger of folding for lack of funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day at the park should be worry-free the idea behind the novel project is aimed at preventing child molestation .
the therapy , developed at the charite clinic , has been co-funded by the child-victim rights group hansel & gretel foundation , and the volkswagen foundation .
no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .
people who took part in the study were promised anonymity .
the message given to the patients was , “ you aren ’ t to blame for your sexual desires , but you are responsible for your sexual actions , ” beier said .
learning what children really want a key part of the course , described by the charite as unique world-wide , is to teach the potential pedophiles , through role-playing , to understand the child 's view and that they only imagined children were offering sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of those with the urge seem to want to fight it " one aim was to teach the pedophile men to clearly pick up their warning signals .
for example these could be thinking about a child often , giving a child presents or inviting a child over , " one therapist , david goecker , told dpa news service .
the men were better able to control their urges after the course of treatment , according to the researchers .
in severe cases , impulse-curbing drugs were prescribed , to improve behavior controls .
there is no guarantee the patients would not molest children in the future , " but we can reduce the risk , " said goecker .
funding is threatened despite the high demand and apparent successes , however , the future of the project is in danger .
the volkswagen foundation has said it would only continue its financing of the project if additional sponsors can be found , hansel & gretel ’ s ceo jerome braun told news agencies .
hansel & gretel chairwoman barbara schäfer-wiegand called upon the german federal ministry for education and research , as well as private donors and foundations , to lend their support to the therapy research . # b # one percent of german men are thought to have pedophilic tendencies , schäfer-wiegand said .
these people need to be exposed to therapy “ before thoughts turn to action . ”
' dark field ' outside the law per year , some 15,000 cases of child sex abuse are reported in germany , but the number of unreported cases is thought to be about four times that .
the project ’ s official name is the dark field prevention project : “ dark field ” standing for the shadowy area outside the legal system where potential child molesters lurk .
the project is aimed at three groups of people : men who have never assaulted a child but fear they may ; men who have already molested a child but were never charged , and those who where charged and completed their sentences , but who fear a relapse . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

some 550 people responded to the ad campaign , which ran under the slogan , “ do you love children more than they want you to ? ”
ninety men were accepted for the initial round of therapy .
on wednesday , researchers said 20 men had successfully completed the therapy so far .
now , 45 men with either a history of child-molestation or an urge to do so , are waiting for a slot in a group slated to start in autumn .
but they may be waiting in vain .
the project is in danger of folding for lack of funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day at the park should be worry-free the idea behind the novel project is aimed at preventing child molestation .
the therapy , developed at the charite clinic , has been co-funded by the child-victim rights group hansel & gretel foundation , and the volkswagen foundation .
no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .
people who took part in the study were promised anonymity .
the message given to the patients was , “ you aren ’ t to blame for your sexual desires , but you are responsible for your sexual actions , ” beier said .
learning what children really want a key part of the course , described by the charite as unique world-wide , is to teach the potential pedophiles , through role-playing , to understand the child 's view and that they only imagined children were offering sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of those with the urge seem to want to fight it " one aim was to teach the pedophile men to clearly pick up their warning signals .
for example these could be thinking about a child often , giving a child presents or inviting a child over , " one therapist , david goecker , told dpa news service .
the men were better able to control their urges after the course of treatment , according to the researchers .
in severe cases , impulse-curbing drugs were prescribed , to improve behavior controls .
there is no guarantee the patients would not molest children in the future , " but we can reduce the risk , " said goecker .
funding is threatened despite the high demand and apparent successes , however , the future of the project is in danger .
the volkswagen foundation has said it would only continue its financing of the project if additional sponsors can be found , hansel & gretel ’ s ceo jerome braun told news agencies .
hansel & gretel chairwoman barbara schäfer-wiegand called upon the german federal ministry for education and research , as well as private donors and foundations , to lend their support to the therapy research . # b # one percent of german men are thought to have pedophilic tendencies , schäfer-wiegand said .
these people need to be exposed to therapy “ before thoughts turn to action . ”
' dark field ' outside the law per year , some 15,000 cases of child sex abuse are reported in germany , but the number of unreported cases is thought to be about four times that .
the project ’ s official name is the dark field prevention project : “ dark field ” standing for the shadowy area outside the legal system where potential child molesters lurk .
the project is aimed at three groups of people : men who have never assaulted a child but fear they may ; men who have already molested a child but were never charged , and those who where charged and completed their sentences , but who fear a relapse . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 31.05.2007 telecom market overhaul to affect germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jajah combines voip with traditional telephones german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is investing heftily in internet telephony provider jajah .
experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .
" you have to be really well positioned in this business , " welfens said .

experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .
" you have to be really well positioned in this business , " welfens said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moma in berlin " was a real crowd magnet some 1.2 million people flocked to see the hugely successful exhibition .
this time , the debonair art connoisseur secured a five-month loan of some 150 french 19th century art masterpieces belonging to the metropolitan museum of art on new york 's fifth avenue .
paintings by ingres , corot , courbet , puvis de chavannes , manet , degas , pissarro , monet , cezanne , gauguin , bonnard and matisse as well as sculptures by rodin and maillol will go on display at the neue nationalgalerie in berlin from june 1 to oct .
7 .
berlin 's " most beautiful french " exhibition is highlighted by five magnificent paintings by cezanne , eleven by courbet , 12 by degas , and seven by manet .
special halls are dedicated to the work of monet and degas .
nine sculptures by august rodin will also be on view , among them his spectacular " burghers of calais . "
foundations of modernity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the birth of venus " by alexandre cabanel the metropolitan museum of art has long boasted the largest and most significant permanent collection of 19th century french art alongside the musee d 'orsay in paris .
with france being the undisputed center of artistic development in the 19th century , the creations of that time laid the foundations of modernity as it dawned before the turn of the century .
monumental highlights of this epoch , such as ingres ' " odalisque in grisaille , " courbet 's " woman with a parrot , " manet 's " boating " , degas ' " the dance class " , monet 's " la grenouillere , " gauguin 's " la orana maria / hail mary " and rodin 's touching sculptures are all brought together for the first time in berlin at the exhibition .
permission to travel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rodin 's " adam " normally , the met 's prize french works are never allowed to leave the new york museum .
an exception was made by phillipe de montebello , the chief of the met , when plans were drafted for the renovation and enlargement of the 19th century galleries housing the museum 's european collections this summer .
this enabled the stunning collection of french art works to be sent to berlin .
curiously , berlin 's 2004 " moma " exhibition also came about in similar fashion , after the museum of modern art decided its premises also needed enlarging .
raue , a lawyer and the chairman of the city 's " friends of the national gallery foundation " has long enjoyed close collaborative ties with both the met and the museum of modern art in new york .
" we provide each other with generous loans , " raue said .
" we cooperate on exhibitions and both the directors and curators of the two museums know and respect each other . "
crowds expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition is expected to draw large crowds this latest major berlin exhibition is expected to draw huge crowds .
weeks before the official opening , 500 planned guided tours of the exhibition were fully booked out , and 1,500 first-day vip tickets snapped up .
a supplementary french exhibition is now also being staged at the alte nationalgalerie on the city 's museum island .
this museum was the first in germany to take a serious look at french impressionist painting .
already in 1896 , it had acquired a noted work by eduard manet titled " in the wintergarten . "
other paintings by monet , renoir , degas , cezanne and rodin would follow .
violet-colored pigs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " odalisque in grisaille " by jean auguste dominique ingres hugo von tschudi , who was the director of the nationalgalerie from 1896 to 1908 , had an often stormy relationship with german monarch kaiser wilhelm ii over his interest in french impressionist painting .
" please , no violet-colored pigs , " barked the kaiser when von tschudi first met him to talk about art acquisitions in 1896 .
von tschudi , who refused to be brow-beaten , would later establish contact with paul durand-ruel , a paris impressionist art dealer , from whom he secured not only manet 's noted " wintergarten " , but also works by courbet , monet , cezanne and degas for the alte nationalgalerie .
their art clashes later came to a head when the kaiser insisted all art gifts from wealthy patrons must from then on be agreed with him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 31.05.2007 finland to ban smoking in bars and restaurants on june 1 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu countries have already banned smoking on friday , finland is to become the latest european nation to ban smoking in bars and restaurants , a measure that is expected to be introduced fairly painlessly in the tobacco-critical state . finland already banned smoking in public places in 1977 and in workplaces in 1995 , leaving bars and restaurants as the only sanctuary until now .
according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "
a eurobarometer poll also showed that the complete ban on smoking in all public places is supported by 96 percent of finns , a higher figure than in the rest of europe .
latest attempts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relegated to the outdoors the latest ban is finland 's second bid at prohibiting smoking in bars and restaurants following a failed 1999 attempt .
" back then restaurant owners were very much against it , " simonen said .
" when we prepared the new legislation -lrb- this time -rrb- , we worked together with employers and unions and have reached a consensus . "
bars , cafés and restaurants larger than 50 square meters -lrb- 164 square feet -rrb- with a proper ventilation system can , during a two-year transition period , set up special smoking sections covering half the size of the premises .
in smaller establishments , cigarettes will be prohibited altogether or smoking rooms will have to be built .
the room can not let out any smoke and customers are not allowed to eat or drink in the special booths .
establishments failing to comply with the new law risk a fine as do smokers disobeying the law .
setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .
but the only european nation to meet that target so far is sweden , where 18 percent of people smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland wants to make smoking less " cool " among younth finland is not far behind .
according to the department for promotion of welfare and health , 22 percent of finns smoke , or 24 percent of men and 19 percent of women .
according to simonen " the minimum goal is to go under 20 percent . "
but the nordic state still has some way to go before reaching former prime minister paavo lipponen 's goal of a " zero smoking " population .
he also proposed banning all tobacco products in finland by 2040 .
" a ban would clearly outline the tobacco policy , " lipponen said .
" at the same time it would discourage young people from smoking . "
ireland was the first european state to introduce a complete ban on smoking in public places in march 2004 .
since then norway , italy , malta , sweden , scotland , latvia and lithuania have followed suit .
wales introduced a ban on april 2 , followed by northern ireland on april 30 .
belgium , denmark , england , france , germany , greece , iceland and romania also have similar plans . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's federal states agree smoking ban with exceptions germany 's federal states agreed thursday to ban smoking in restaurants and pubs , but allowed exceptions for small bars and premises with extra smoking rooms .
-lrb- 22.03.2007 -rrb- german states agree on limited smoking ban in restaurants germany 's 16 states agreed friday to a limited smoking ban in restaurants and cafes but left a wide berth for regions to create loopholes .

" merkel said that while she could make only a " brief assessment , " bush 's remarks were an " important step on the road " to the g8 summit next week in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .
" what is positive is that we can see from the speech given by president bush today that no one can get past climate change , " merkel said .
" it is there .
it is also essentially caused by humankind . "
" that is the shared basis on which we are now acting , " merkel said , although she acknowledged much work had to be done .
the german chancellor also stressed that it was " very important to bring the un into the process .
" but i do see movement on the whole question , " she said .
the united states signed the 1997 un-backed kyoto protocol to limit the emission of greenhouse gases - one of the major causes of global warming - but never ratified the treaty .
a new framework bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush kept quiet on details of the plan in a speech in washington setting out his agenda for the g8 summit , bush said the united states " will work with other nations to establish a new framework on greenhouse gas emissions for when the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 . "
he gave , however , few details and made no mention of mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions such as those contained in the kyoto protocol .
under the us proposal , nations would also develop " mid-term national targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs , " bush said .
the us has argued that it favors using technology to fight global warming rather than imposing emissions limits which could hamper economic growth .
limiting emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will g8 leaders reach agreement behind the fence ?
merkel , on the other hand , has staked germany 's 12-month g8 presidency on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases .
the prospects of that happening at the g8 summit in heiligendamm on the baltic coast appear increasingly slim , with clear differences appearing between g8 nations on how to limit greenhouse gases .
washington has strong objections to the proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for the summit , according to leaked documents .
british prime minister tony blair , however , called bush 's announcement tackling climate change a " big step forward .
" this is what we have been working for , " blair said .
" obviously it 's a big step forward and it sets the right framework for next week 's meeting . "

experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .
" you have to be really well positioned in this business , " welfens said .

" merkel said that while she could make only a " brief assessment , " bush 's remarks were an " important step on the road " to the g8 summit next week in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .
" what is positive is that we can see from the speech given by president bush today that no one can get past climate change , " merkel said .
" it is there .
it is also essentially caused by humankind . "
" that is the shared basis on which we are now acting , " merkel said , although she acknowledged much work had to be done .
the german chancellor also stressed that it was " very important to bring the un into the process .
" but i do see movement on the whole question , " she said .
the united states signed the 1997 un-backed kyoto protocol to limit the emission of greenhouse gases - one of the major causes of global warming - but never ratified the treaty .

"
he gave , however , few details and made no mention of mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions such as those contained in the kyoto protocol .
under the us proposal , nations would also develop " mid-term national targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs , " bush said .
the us has argued that it favors using technology to fight global warming rather than imposing emissions limits which could hamper economic growth .
limiting emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will g8 leaders reach agreement behind the fence ?
merkel , on the other hand , has staked germany 's 12-month g8 presidency on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases .
the prospects of that happening at the g8 summit in heiligendamm on the baltic coast appear increasingly slim , with clear differences appearing between g8 nations on how to limit greenhouse gases .
washington has strong objections to the proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for the summit , according to leaked documents .
british prime minister tony blair , however , called bush 's announcement tackling climate change a " big step forward .

merkel , on the other hand , has staked germany 's 12-month g8 presidency on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases .
the prospects of that happening at the g8 summit in heiligendamm on the baltic coast appear increasingly slim , with clear differences appearing between g8 nations on how to limit greenhouse gases .
washington has strong objections to the proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for the summit , according to leaked documents .

experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .
" you have to be really well positioned in this business , " welfens said .

according to raw , unadjusted data published by the federal labor agency in nuremberg , the german jobless rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 9.1 percent in may , the lowest level since october 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mild weather is beneficial for the construction industry the overall jobless total declined by 161,000 to 3.806 million , the lowest number of dole-claimers in germany since november 2001 , the figures showed .
unemployment usually falls in the spring thanks to the warmer weather , which is favorable to sectors such as the construction industry .
labor market helped by warm weather adjusted for such seasonal effects , the jobless rate held steady at 9.2 percent , the lowest level since may 2001 , while the adjusted jobless total rose slightly by 3,000 to 3.855 million .
the small upward blip was unexpected - analysts had been penciling in a decline in the adjusted jobless total of around 12,000 this month - but was largely due to the unusually mild winter , which had caused fewer companies to lay off workers during the preceding months , as well as the heavy rain seen this month , analysts said .
" the economic upturn in germany is continuing apace and is helping to stimulate the labor market , " insisted labor office chief frank weise .
weise suggested that the unadjusted jobless total could fall below 3.5 million by the autumn , with the annual average total for the whole of 2007 likely to come out at 3.8-3.9 million .
analysts were similarly unfazed by the slight rise in the adjusted may jobless total this month .
" surveys of hiring intentions remain consistent with solid employment growth so the may figures may have been adversely affected by special factors such as the rainy weather , which has probably hurt activity in retail sales and construction , " said bnp paribas economist , caroline newhouse-cohen .
" all in all , we assume that there is still some scope for further employment growth and decreasing unemployment over the coming months , " the analyst said .
all the right indicators in place indeed , key confidence surveys such as the zew and widely-watched ifo indices suggested that germany , among all the euro-area economies , was likely to prove most resilient to the strong euro , rising interest rates and the slowdown in growth in the united states , newhouse-cohen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines are getting shorter at german labor offices investor confidence , as measured by the monthly zew index , hit an 11-month high in may , while the ifo business climate index held steady just a fraction off its all-time high .
dekabank economist peter leonhardt similarly believed that the upturn on the german labor market " remains intact .
companies ' order books are full and confidence that the economy will continue to prosper is balm for the wounds of the labor market . "
bank of america economist holger schmieding said that the jobless data so far this year had likely been distorted by the unusually mild weather and a new seasonal program to keep people off the dole in the winter .
nevertheless , " the underlying trend in the labor market remains solid , " schmieding said .
" taking the last six months together , unemployment has fallen by a monthly average of 59,000 .
we consider this the underlying trend , which should soon be visible in the headline data again , " he said .
ixis-cib economist sylvain broyer predicted that the jobless figures may move sideways for a few months .
" but we expect the unemployment rate to decline in trend until mid-2008 as the recovery proves to be robust .
indeed , the jobless rate could reach 8.8 percent by the end of this year , " broyer suggested . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reports biggest tax surplus in modern history germany says it expects its biggest tax surplus for half a century as the economy once derided as the " sick man of europe " reaps the benefits from buoyant growth and moderate reforms .

according to raw , unadjusted data published by the federal labor agency in nuremberg , the german jobless rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 9.1 percent in may , the lowest level since october 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mild weather is beneficial for the construction industry the overall jobless total declined by 161,000 to 3.806 million , the lowest number of dole-claimers in germany since november 2001 , the figures showed .
unemployment usually falls in the spring thanks to the warmer weather , which is favorable to sectors such as the construction industry .
labor market helped by warm weather adjusted for such seasonal effects , the jobless rate held steady at 9.2 percent , the lowest level since may 2001 , while the adjusted jobless total rose slightly by 3,000 to 3.855 million .
the small upward blip was unexpected - analysts had been penciling in a decline in the adjusted jobless total of around 12,000 this month - but was largely due to the unusually mild winter , which had caused fewer companies to lay off workers during the preceding months , as well as the heavy rain seen this month , analysts said .
" the economic upturn in germany is continuing apace and is helping to stimulate the labor market , " insisted labor office chief frank weise .
weise suggested that the unadjusted jobless total could fall below 3.5 million by the autumn , with the annual average total for the whole of 2007 likely to come out at 3.8-3.9 million .
analysts were similarly unfazed by the slight rise in the adjusted may jobless total this month .
" surveys of hiring intentions remain consistent with solid employment growth so the may figures may have been adversely affected by special factors such as the rainy weather , which has probably hurt activity in retail sales and construction , " said bnp paribas economist , caroline newhouse-cohen .
" all in all , we assume that there is still some scope for further employment growth and decreasing unemployment over the coming months , " the analyst said .
all the right indicators in place indeed , key confidence surveys such as the zew and widely-watched ifo indices suggested that germany , among all the euro-area economies , was likely to prove most resilient to the strong euro , rising interest rates and the slowdown in growth in the united states , newhouse-cohen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines are getting shorter at german labor offices investor confidence , as measured by the monthly zew index , hit an 11-month high in may , while the ifo business climate index held steady just a fraction off its all-time high .
dekabank economist peter leonhardt similarly believed that the upturn on the german labor market " remains intact .
companies ' order books are full and confidence that the economy will continue to prosper is balm for the wounds of the labor market . "
bank of america economist holger schmieding said that the jobless data so far this year had likely been distorted by the unusually mild weather and a new seasonal program to keep people off the dole in the winter .
nevertheless , " the underlying trend in the labor market remains solid , " schmieding said .
" taking the last six months together , unemployment has fallen by a monthly average of 59,000 .
we consider this the underlying trend , which should soon be visible in the headline data again , " he said .
ixis-cib economist sylvain broyer predicted that the jobless figures may move sideways for a few months .
" but we expect the unemployment rate to decline in trend until mid-2008 as the recovery proves to be robust .
indeed , the jobless rate could reach 8.8 percent by the end of this year , " broyer suggested . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reports biggest tax surplus in modern history germany says it expects its biggest tax surplus for half a century as the economy once derided as the " sick man of europe " reaps the benefits from buoyant growth and moderate reforms .

according to raw , unadjusted data published by the federal labor agency in nuremberg , the german jobless rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 9.1 percent in may , the lowest level since october 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mild weather is beneficial for the construction industry the overall jobless total declined by 161,000 to 3.806 million , the lowest number of dole-claimers in germany since november 2001 , the figures showed .
unemployment usually falls in the spring thanks to the warmer weather , which is favorable to sectors such as the construction industry .
labor market helped by warm weather adjusted for such seasonal effects , the jobless rate held steady at 9.2 percent , the lowest level since may 2001 , while the adjusted jobless total rose slightly by 3,000 to 3.855 million .
the small upward blip was unexpected - analysts had been penciling in a decline in the adjusted jobless total of around 12,000 this month - but was largely due to the unusually mild winter , which had caused fewer companies to lay off workers during the preceding months , as well as the heavy rain seen this month , analysts said .
" the economic upturn in germany is continuing apace and is helping to stimulate the labor market , " insisted labor office chief frank weise .
weise suggested that the unadjusted jobless total could fall below 3.5 million by the autumn , with the annual average total for the whole of 2007 likely to come out at 3.8-3.9 million .
analysts were similarly unfazed by the slight rise in the adjusted may jobless total this month .
" surveys of hiring intentions remain consistent with solid employment growth so the may figures may have been adversely affected by special factors such as the rainy weather , which has probably hurt activity in retail sales and construction , " said bnp paribas economist , caroline newhouse-cohen .

experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .

" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .

while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moma in berlin " was a real crowd magnet some 1.2 million people flocked to see the hugely successful exhibition .
this time , the debonair art connoisseur secured a five-month loan of some 150 french 19th century art masterpieces belonging to the metropolitan museum of art on new york 's fifth avenue .
paintings by ingres , corot , courbet , puvis de chavannes , manet , degas , pissarro , monet , cezanne , gauguin , bonnard and matisse as well as sculptures by rodin and maillol will go on display at the neue nationalgalerie in berlin from june 1 to oct .
7 .
berlin 's " most beautiful french " exhibition is highlighted by five magnificent paintings by cezanne , eleven by courbet , 12 by degas , and seven by manet .
special halls are dedicated to the work of monet and degas .
nine sculptures by august rodin will also be on view , among them his spectacular " burghers of calais . "
foundations of modernity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the birth of venus " by alexandre cabanel the metropolitan museum of art has long boasted the largest and most significant permanent collection of 19th century french art alongside the musee d 'orsay in paris .
with france being the undisputed center of artistic development in the 19th century , the creations of that time laid the foundations of modernity as it dawned before the turn of the century .
monumental highlights of this epoch , such as ingres ' " odalisque in grisaille , " courbet 's " woman with a parrot , " manet 's " boating " , degas ' " the dance class " , monet 's " la grenouillere , " gauguin 's " la orana maria / hail mary " and rodin 's touching sculptures are all brought together for the first time in berlin at the exhibition .
permission to travel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rodin 's " adam " normally , the met 's prize french works are never allowed to leave the new york museum .
an exception was made by phillipe de montebello , the chief of the met , when plans were drafted for the renovation and enlargement of the 19th century galleries housing the museum 's european collections this summer .
this enabled the stunning collection of french art works to be sent to berlin .
curiously , berlin 's 2004 " moma " exhibition also came about in similar fashion , after the museum of modern art decided its premises also needed enlarging .
raue , a lawyer and the chairman of the city 's " friends of the national gallery foundation " has long enjoyed close collaborative ties with both the met and the museum of modern art in new york .
" we provide each other with generous loans , " raue said .
" we cooperate on exhibitions and both the directors and curators of the two museums know and respect each other . "
crowds expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition is expected to draw large crowds this latest major berlin exhibition is expected to draw huge crowds .
weeks before the official opening , 500 planned guided tours of the exhibition were fully booked out , and 1,500 first-day vip tickets snapped up .
a supplementary french exhibition is now also being staged at the alte nationalgalerie on the city 's museum island .
this museum was the first in germany to take a serious look at french impressionist painting .
already in 1896 , it had acquired a noted work by eduard manet titled " in the wintergarten . "
other paintings by monet , renoir , degas , cezanne and rodin would follow .
violet-colored pigs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " odalisque in grisaille " by jean auguste dominique ingres hugo von tschudi , who was the director of the nationalgalerie from 1896 to 1908 , had an often stormy relationship with german monarch kaiser wilhelm ii over his interest in french impressionist painting .
" please , no violet-colored pigs , " barked the kaiser when von tschudi first met him to talk about art acquisitions in 1896 .
von tschudi , who refused to be brow-beaten , would later establish contact with paul durand-ruel , a paris impressionist art dealer , from whom he secured not only manet 's noted " wintergarten " , but also works by courbet , monet , cezanne and degas for the alte nationalgalerie .

berlin 's " most beautiful french " exhibition is highlighted by five magnificent paintings by cezanne , eleven by courbet , 12 by degas , and seven by manet .
special halls are dedicated to the work of monet and degas .

a supplementary french exhibition is now also being staged at the alte nationalgalerie on the city 's museum island .
this museum was the first in germany to take a serious look at french impressionist painting .

some 550 people responded to the ad campaign , which ran under the slogan , “ do you love children more than they want you to ? ”
ninety men were accepted for the initial round of therapy .
on wednesday , researchers said 20 men had successfully completed the therapy so far .
now , 45 men with either a history of child-molestation or an urge to do so , are waiting for a slot in a group slated to start in autumn .
but they may be waiting in vain .
the project is in danger of folding for lack of funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day at the park should be worry-free the idea behind the novel project is aimed at preventing child molestation .
the therapy , developed at the charite clinic , has been co-funded by the child-victim rights group hansel & gretel foundation , and the volkswagen foundation .
no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .
people who took part in the study were promised anonymity .
the message given to the patients was , “ you aren ’ t to blame for your sexual desires , but you are responsible for your sexual actions , ” beier said .
learning what children really want a key part of the course , described by the charite as unique world-wide , is to teach the potential pedophiles , through role-playing , to understand the child 's view and that they only imagined children were offering sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of those with the urge seem to want to fight it " one aim was to teach the pedophile men to clearly pick up their warning signals .

the men were better able to control their urges after the course of treatment , according to the researchers .
in severe cases , impulse-curbing drugs were prescribed , to improve behavior controls .
there is no guarantee the patients would not molest children in the future , " but we can reduce the risk , " said goecker .
funding is threatened despite the high demand and apparent successes , however , the future of the project is in danger .
the volkswagen foundation has said it would only continue its financing of the project if additional sponsors can be found , hansel & gretel ’ s ceo jerome braun told news agencies .
hansel & gretel chairwoman barbara schäfer-wiegand called upon the german federal ministry for education and research , as well as private donors and foundations , to lend their support to the therapy research . # b # one percent of german men are thought to have pedophilic tendencies , schäfer-wiegand said .
these people need to be exposed to therapy “ before thoughts turn to action . ”
' dark field ' outside the law per year , some 15,000 cases of child sex abuse are reported in germany , but the number of unreported cases is thought to be about four times that .
the project ’ s official name is the dark field prevention project : “ dark field ” standing for the shadowy area outside the legal system where potential child molesters lurk .

some 550 people responded to the ad campaign , which ran under the slogan , “ do you love children more than they want you to ? ”
ninety men were accepted for the initial round of therapy .
on wednesday , researchers said 20 men had successfully completed the therapy so far .
now , 45 men with either a history of child-molestation or an urge to do so , are waiting for a slot in a group slated to start in autumn .
but they may be waiting in vain .
the project is in danger of folding for lack of funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day at the park should be worry-free the idea behind the novel project is aimed at preventing child molestation .
the therapy , developed at the charite clinic , has been co-funded by the child-victim rights group hansel & gretel foundation , and the volkswagen foundation .
no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .
people who took part in the study were promised anonymity .
the message given to the patients was , “ you aren ’ t to blame for your sexual desires , but you are responsible for your sexual actions , ” beier said .
learning what children really want a key part of the course , described by the charite as unique world-wide , is to teach the potential pedophiles , through role-playing , to understand the child 's view and that they only imagined children were offering sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of those with the urge seem to want to fight it " one aim was to teach the pedophile men to clearly pick up their warning signals .
for example these could be thinking about a child often , giving a child presents or inviting a child over , " one therapist , david goecker , told dpa news service .
the men were better able to control their urges after the course of treatment , according to the researchers .
in severe cases , impulse-curbing drugs were prescribed , to improve behavior controls .
there is no guarantee the patients would not molest children in the future , " but we can reduce the risk , " said goecker .
funding is threatened despite the high demand and apparent successes , however , the future of the project is in danger .
the volkswagen foundation has said it would only continue its financing of the project if additional sponsors can be found , hansel & gretel ’ s ceo jerome braun told news agencies .
hansel & gretel chairwoman barbara schäfer-wiegand called upon the german federal ministry for education and research , as well as private donors and foundations , to lend their support to the therapy research . # b # one percent of german men are thought to have pedophilic tendencies , schäfer-wiegand said .
these people need to be exposed to therapy “ before thoughts turn to action . ”
' dark field ' outside the law per year , some 15,000 cases of child sex abuse are reported in germany , but the number of unreported cases is thought to be about four times that .
the project ’ s official name is the dark field prevention project : “ dark field ” standing for the shadowy area outside the legal system where potential child molesters lurk .
the project is aimed at three groups of people : men who have never assaulted a child but fear they may ; men who have already molested a child but were never charged , and those who where charged and completed their sentences , but who fear a relapse . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "
a eurobarometer poll also showed that the complete ban on smoking in all public places is supported by 96 percent of finns , a higher figure than in the rest of europe .
latest attempts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relegated to the outdoors the latest ban is finland 's second bid at prohibiting smoking in bars and restaurants following a failed 1999 attempt .
" back then restaurant owners were very much against it , " simonen said .
" when we prepared the new legislation -lrb- this time -rrb- , we worked together with employers and unions and have reached a consensus . "
bars , cafés and restaurants larger than 50 square meters -lrb- 164 square feet -rrb- with a proper ventilation system can , during a two-year transition period , set up special smoking sections covering half the size of the premises .
in smaller establishments , cigarettes will be prohibited altogether or smoking rooms will have to be built .
the room can not let out any smoke and customers are not allowed to eat or drink in the special booths .
establishments failing to comply with the new law risk a fine as do smokers disobeying the law .
setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .
but the only european nation to meet that target so far is sweden , where 18 percent of people smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland wants to make smoking less " cool " among younth finland is not far behind .
according to the department for promotion of welfare and health , 22 percent of finns smoke , or 24 percent of men and 19 percent of women .
according to simonen " the minimum goal is to go under 20 percent . "
but the nordic state still has some way to go before reaching former prime minister paavo lipponen 's goal of a " zero smoking " population .
he also proposed banning all tobacco products in finland by 2040 .
" a ban would clearly outline the tobacco policy , " lipponen said .
" at the same time it would discourage young people from smoking . "
ireland was the first european state to introduce a complete ban on smoking in public places in march 2004 .
since then norway , italy , malta , sweden , scotland , latvia and lithuania have followed suit .
wales introduced a ban on april 2 , followed by northern ireland on april 30 .

experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .
" you have to be really well positioned in this business , " welfens said .

an increasing number of germans are leaving home and going abroad to live .
in 2006 , emigration was at the highest level since the 1940s . more than 155,000 germans left the country last year , the federal statistics office said .
that 's around seven percent more than in the previous year .
the net emigration of germans last year rose to a post-unification high of 51,906 .
this was up considerably from the previous year .
in 2005 , the gap between the number of germans leaving and returning was 16,764 .
favorite destinations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is the no. 1 destination for german emigrants " switzerland , the us and austria were the top three destinations , " said statistician claire brobecker .
the reasons for these trends is not included in the data received by the federal statistics office .
" we can not measure this on the basis of the information we receive .
it would be mere speculation , " said brobecker .
but the economy in germany has been sluggish in recent years - certainly in comparison with its alpine neighbors .
for the most part , germans are believed to be escaping unemployment or seeking better pay and conditions .

according to raw , unadjusted data published by the federal labor agency in nuremberg , the german jobless rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 9.1 percent in may , the lowest level since october 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mild weather is beneficial for the construction industry the overall jobless total declined by 161,000 to 3.806 million , the lowest number of dole-claimers in germany since november 2001 , the figures showed .
unemployment usually falls in the spring thanks to the warmer weather , which is favorable to sectors such as the construction industry .
labor market helped by warm weather adjusted for such seasonal effects , the jobless rate held steady at 9.2 percent , the lowest level since may 2001 , while the adjusted jobless total rose slightly by 3,000 to 3.855 million .
the small upward blip was unexpected - analysts had been penciling in a decline in the adjusted jobless total of around 12,000 this month - but was largely due to the unusually mild winter , which had caused fewer companies to lay off workers during the preceding months , as well as the heavy rain seen this month , analysts said .
" the economic upturn in germany is continuing apace and is helping to stimulate the labor market , " insisted labor office chief frank weise .
weise suggested that the unadjusted jobless total could fall below 3.5 million by the autumn , with the annual average total for the whole of 2007 likely to come out at 3.8-3.9 million .
analysts were similarly unfazed by the slight rise in the adjusted may jobless total this month .
" surveys of hiring intentions remain consistent with solid employment growth so the may figures may have been adversely affected by special factors such as the rainy weather , which has probably hurt activity in retail sales and construction , " said bnp paribas economist , caroline newhouse-cohen .
" all in all , we assume that there is still some scope for further employment growth and decreasing unemployment over the coming months , " the analyst said .
all the right indicators in place indeed , key confidence surveys such as the zew and widely-watched ifo indices suggested that germany , among all the euro-area economies , was likely to prove most resilient to the strong euro , rising interest rates and the slowdown in growth in the united states , newhouse-cohen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines are getting shorter at german labor offices investor confidence , as measured by the monthly zew index , hit an 11-month high in may , while the ifo business climate index held steady just a fraction off its all-time high .
dekabank economist peter leonhardt similarly believed that the upturn on the german labor market " remains intact .
companies ' order books are full and confidence that the economy will continue to prosper is balm for the wounds of the labor market . "
bank of america economist holger schmieding said that the jobless data so far this year had likely been distorted by the unusually mild weather and a new seasonal program to keep people off the dole in the winter .
nevertheless , " the underlying trend in the labor market remains solid , " schmieding said .
" taking the last six months together , unemployment has fallen by a monthly average of 59,000 .
we consider this the underlying trend , which should soon be visible in the headline data again , " he said .
ixis-cib economist sylvain broyer predicted that the jobless figures may move sideways for a few months .
" but we expect the unemployment rate to decline in trend until mid-2008 as the recovery proves to be robust .

" one has to wonder if you 're really concerned about greenhouse gas emissions why you are n't interested in nuclear power , " she told reporters at the end of a meeting of g8 foreign ministers in the eastern german city of potsdam .

" we 're seeking to achieve if not agreement then at least a closing of a gap between us .
it 's not an easy issue , " he said .
" as europeans we are coming closer together on setting limits and benchmarks .
other people are banking on technological solutions .
what is important is that in our international efforts we come closer together .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moma in berlin " was a real crowd magnet some 1.2 million people flocked to see the hugely successful exhibition .
this time , the debonair art connoisseur secured a five-month loan of some 150 french 19th century art masterpieces belonging to the metropolitan museum of art on new york 's fifth avenue .
paintings by ingres , corot , courbet , puvis de chavannes , manet , degas , pissarro , monet , cezanne , gauguin , bonnard and matisse as well as sculptures by rodin and maillol will go on display at the neue nationalgalerie in berlin from june 1 to oct .
7 .
berlin 's " most beautiful french " exhibition is highlighted by five magnificent paintings by cezanne , eleven by courbet , 12 by degas , and seven by manet .
special halls are dedicated to the work of monet and degas .
nine sculptures by august rodin will also be on view , among them his spectacular " burghers of calais . "
foundations of modernity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the birth of venus " by alexandre cabanel the metropolitan museum of art has long boasted the largest and most significant permanent collection of 19th century french art alongside the musee d 'orsay in paris .
with france being the undisputed center of artistic development in the 19th century , the creations of that time laid the foundations of modernity as it dawned before the turn of the century .
monumental highlights of this epoch , such as ingres ' " odalisque in grisaille , " courbet 's " woman with a parrot , " manet 's " boating " , degas ' " the dance class " , monet 's " la grenouillere , " gauguin 's " la orana maria / hail mary " and rodin 's touching sculptures are all brought together for the first time in berlin at the exhibition .
permission to travel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rodin 's " adam " normally , the met 's prize french works are never allowed to leave the new york museum .
an exception was made by phillipe de montebello , the chief of the met , when plans were drafted for the renovation and enlargement of the 19th century galleries housing the museum 's european collections this summer .
this enabled the stunning collection of french art works to be sent to berlin .
curiously , berlin 's 2004 " moma " exhibition also came about in similar fashion , after the museum of modern art decided its premises also needed enlarging .
raue , a lawyer and the chairman of the city 's " friends of the national gallery foundation " has long enjoyed close collaborative ties with both the met and the museum of modern art in new york .
" we provide each other with generous loans , " raue said .
" we cooperate on exhibitions and both the directors and curators of the two museums know and respect each other . "
crowds expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition is expected to draw large crowds this latest major berlin exhibition is expected to draw huge crowds .
weeks before the official opening , 500 planned guided tours of the exhibition were fully booked out , and 1,500 first-day vip tickets snapped up .
a supplementary french exhibition is now also being staged at the alte nationalgalerie on the city 's museum island .
this museum was the first in germany to take a serious look at french impressionist painting .
already in 1896 , it had acquired a noted work by eduard manet titled " in the wintergarten . "
other paintings by monet , renoir , degas , cezanne and rodin would follow .
violet-colored pigs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " odalisque in grisaille " by jean auguste dominique ingres hugo von tschudi , who was the director of the nationalgalerie from 1896 to 1908 , had an often stormy relationship with german monarch kaiser wilhelm ii over his interest in french impressionist painting .
" please , no violet-colored pigs , " barked the kaiser when von tschudi first met him to talk about art acquisitions in 1896 .
von tschudi , who refused to be brow-beaten , would later establish contact with paul durand-ruel , a paris impressionist art dealer , from whom he secured not only manet 's noted " wintergarten " , but also works by courbet , monet , cezanne and degas for the alte nationalgalerie .
their art clashes later came to a head when the kaiser insisted all art gifts from wealthy patrons must from then on be agreed with him .

experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .
" you have to be really well positioned in this business , " welfens said .

sparks are already flying between us and germany , as washington accuses berlin of intolerance towards other viewpoints . us secretary of state condoleezza rice aimed a jab at germany 's environmental credentials wednesday ahead of an expected showdown at next week 's group of eight summit . rice said countries like germany , which prides itself on its green image , should respect the us policy of looking to technology to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions . " one has to wonder if you 're really concerned about greenhouse gas emissions why you are n't interested in nuclear power , " she told reporters at the end of a meeting of g8 foreign ministers in the eastern german city of potsdam .

" we 're seeking to achieve if not agreement then at least a closing of a gap between us .
it 's not an easy issue , " he said .

" merkel said that while she could make only a " brief assessment , " bush 's remarks were an " important step on the road " to the g8 summit next week in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .
" what is positive is that we can see from the speech given by president bush today that no one can get past climate change , " merkel said .
" it is there .
it is also essentially caused by humankind . "
" that is the shared basis on which we are now acting , " merkel said , although she acknowledged much work had to be done .
the german chancellor also stressed that it was " very important to bring the un into the process .
" but i do see movement on the whole question , " she said .
the united states signed the 1997 un-backed kyoto protocol to limit the emission of greenhouse gases - one of the major causes of global warming - but never ratified the treaty .
a new framework bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush kept quiet on details of the plan in a speech in washington setting out his agenda for the g8 summit , bush said the united states " will work with other nations to establish a new framework on greenhouse gas emissions for when the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 . "
he gave , however , few details and made no mention of mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions such as those contained in the kyoto protocol .
under the us proposal , nations would also develop " mid-term national targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs , " bush said .
the us has argued that it favors using technology to fight global warming rather than imposing emissions limits which could hamper economic growth .
limiting emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will g8 leaders reach agreement behind the fence ?
merkel , on the other hand , has staked germany 's 12-month g8 presidency on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases .
the prospects of that happening at the g8 summit in heiligendamm on the baltic coast appear increasingly slim , with clear differences appearing between g8 nations on how to limit greenhouse gases .
washington has strong objections to the proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for the summit , according to leaked documents .
british prime minister tony blair , however , called bush 's announcement tackling climate change a " big step forward .
" this is what we have been working for , " blair said .
" obviously it 's a big step forward and it sets the right framework for next week 's meeting . "
the g8 summit will be attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
research and development the us president said he would push g8 leaders to boost investment in research and development of environment-friendly technologies , and would help poor countries acquire such cutting-edge science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush banks on clean energy technologies " we 're also going to work to conclude talks with other nations on eliminating tariffs and other barriers to clean energy technologies and services by the end of this year , " he said .
" we 'll help the world 's poorest nations reduce emissions by giving them government-developed technologies at low cost or in some case no cost at all , " said the us president .
amid early media reports of bush 's plan , greenpeace spokesman jörg feddern criticized the proposal as an attempt to undermine the united nations ' kyoto process with its mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions .
" this is fatal for climate protection , " feddern told afp .
the role of emerging economies under the kyoto procotol , 35 industrialized nations that have signed and ratified the pact are required to make targeted cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- .

the us administration has cited this as a reason for not submitting the protocol for ratification by the senate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 31.05.2007 telecom market overhaul to affect germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jajah combines voip with traditional telephones german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom is investing heftily in internet telephony provider jajah .
experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .

dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .

experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .

some 550 people responded to the ad campaign , which ran under the slogan , “ do you love children more than they want you to ? ”
ninety men were accepted for the initial round of therapy .
on wednesday , researchers said 20 men had successfully completed the therapy so far .
now , 45 men with either a history of child-molestation or an urge to do so , are waiting for a slot in a group slated to start in autumn .
but they may be waiting in vain .
the project is in danger of folding for lack of funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day at the park should be worry-free the idea behind the novel project is aimed at preventing child molestation .
the therapy , developed at the charite clinic , has been co-funded by the child-victim rights group hansel & gretel foundation , and the volkswagen foundation .
no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .
people who took part in the study were promised anonymity .
the message given to the patients was , “ you aren ’ t to blame for your sexual desires , but you are responsible for your sexual actions , ” beier said .
learning what children really want a key part of the course , described by the charite as unique world-wide , is to teach the potential pedophiles , through role-playing , to understand the child 's view and that they only imagined children were offering sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of those with the urge seem to want to fight it " one aim was to teach the pedophile men to clearly pick up their warning signals .
for example these could be thinking about a child often , giving a child presents or inviting a child over , " one therapist , david goecker , told dpa news service .
the men were better able to control their urges after the course of treatment , according to the researchers .
in severe cases , impulse-curbing drugs were prescribed , to improve behavior controls .
there is no guarantee the patients would not molest children in the future , " but we can reduce the risk , " said goecker .
funding is threatened despite the high demand and apparent successes , however , the future of the project is in danger .
the volkswagen foundation has said it would only continue its financing of the project if additional sponsors can be found , hansel & gretel ’ s ceo jerome braun told news agencies .
hansel & gretel chairwoman barbara schäfer-wiegand called upon the german federal ministry for education and research , as well as private donors and foundations , to lend their support to the therapy research . # b # one percent of german men are thought to have pedophilic tendencies , schäfer-wiegand said .
these people need to be exposed to therapy “ before thoughts turn to action . ”
' dark field ' outside the law per year , some 15,000 cases of child sex abuse are reported in germany , but the number of unreported cases is thought to be about four times that .
the project ’ s official name is the dark field prevention project : “ dark field ” standing for the shadowy area outside the legal system where potential child molesters lurk .
the project is aimed at three groups of people : men who have never assaulted a child but fear they may ; men who have already molested a child but were never charged , and those who where charged and completed their sentences , but who fear a relapse . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

some 550 people responded to the ad campaign , which ran under the slogan , “ do you love children more than they want you to ? ”
ninety men were accepted for the initial round of therapy .
on wednesday , researchers said 20 men had successfully completed the therapy so far .
now , 45 men with either a history of child-molestation or an urge to do so , are waiting for a slot in a group slated to start in autumn .
but they may be waiting in vain .
the project is in danger of folding for lack of funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day at the park should be worry-free the idea behind the novel project is aimed at preventing child molestation .
the therapy , developed at the charite clinic , has been co-funded by the child-victim rights group hansel & gretel foundation , and the volkswagen foundation .
no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .
people who took part in the study were promised anonymity .
the message given to the patients was , “ you aren ’ t to blame for your sexual desires , but you are responsible for your sexual actions , ” beier said .
learning what children really want a key part of the course , described by the charite as unique world-wide , is to teach the potential pedophiles , through role-playing , to understand the child 's view and that they only imagined children were offering sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of those with the urge seem to want to fight it " one aim was to teach the pedophile men to clearly pick up their warning signals .
for example these could be thinking about a child often , giving a child presents or inviting a child over , " one therapist , david goecker , told dpa news service .
the men were better able to control their urges after the course of treatment , according to the researchers .
in severe cases , impulse-curbing drugs were prescribed , to improve behavior controls .
there is no guarantee the patients would not molest children in the future , " but we can reduce the risk , " said goecker .
funding is threatened despite the high demand and apparent successes , however , the future of the project is in danger .
the volkswagen foundation has said it would only continue its financing of the project if additional sponsors can be found , hansel & gretel ’ s ceo jerome braun told news agencies .
hansel & gretel chairwoman barbara schäfer-wiegand called upon the german federal ministry for education and research , as well as private donors and foundations , to lend their support to the therapy research . # b # one percent of german men are thought to have pedophilic tendencies , schäfer-wiegand said .
these people need to be exposed to therapy “ before thoughts turn to action . ”
' dark field ' outside the law per year , some 15,000 cases of child sex abuse are reported in germany , but the number of unreported cases is thought to be about four times that .
the project ’ s official name is the dark field prevention project : “ dark field ” standing for the shadowy area outside the legal system where potential child molesters lurk .
the project is aimed at three groups of people : men who have never assaulted a child but fear they may ; men who have already molested a child but were never charged , and those who where charged and completed their sentences , but who fear a relapse . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 31.05.2007 booming german economy keeps jobless rate at six-year low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming economy has created more jobs the current economic boom in germany enabled europe 's biggest economy to hold its jobless rate at the lowest level for six years this month , data showed on thursday . the sunny outlook for the german economy will ensure that the positive trend remains intact in the months to come , analysts said .
according to raw , unadjusted data published by the federal labor agency in nuremberg , the german jobless rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 9.1 percent in may , the lowest level since october 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mild weather is beneficial for the construction industry the overall jobless total declined by 161,000 to 3.806 million , the lowest number of dole-claimers in germany since november 2001 , the figures showed .
unemployment usually falls in the spring thanks to the warmer weather , which is favorable to sectors such as the construction industry .
labor market helped by warm weather adjusted for such seasonal effects , the jobless rate held steady at 9.2 percent , the lowest level since may 2001 , while the adjusted jobless total rose slightly by 3,000 to 3.855 million .
the small upward blip was unexpected - analysts had been penciling in a decline in the adjusted jobless total of around 12,000 this month - but was largely due to the unusually mild winter , which had caused fewer companies to lay off workers during the preceding months , as well as the heavy rain seen this month , analysts said .
" the economic upturn in germany is continuing apace and is helping to stimulate the labor market , " insisted labor office chief frank weise .
weise suggested that the unadjusted jobless total could fall below 3.5 million by the autumn , with the annual average total for the whole of 2007 likely to come out at 3.8-3.9 million .
analysts were similarly unfazed by the slight rise in the adjusted may jobless total this month .
" surveys of hiring intentions remain consistent with solid employment growth so the may figures may have been adversely affected by special factors such as the rainy weather , which has probably hurt activity in retail sales and construction , " said bnp paribas economist , caroline newhouse-cohen .
" all in all , we assume that there is still some scope for further employment growth and decreasing unemployment over the coming months , " the analyst said .
all the right indicators in place indeed , key confidence surveys such as the zew and widely-watched ifo indices suggested that germany , among all the euro-area economies , was likely to prove most resilient to the strong euro , rising interest rates and the slowdown in growth in the united states , newhouse-cohen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines are getting shorter at german labor offices investor confidence , as measured by the monthly zew index , hit an 11-month high in may , while the ifo business climate index held steady just a fraction off its all-time high .
dekabank economist peter leonhardt similarly believed that the upturn on the german labor market " remains intact .
companies ' order books are full and confidence that the economy will continue to prosper is balm for the wounds of the labor market . "
bank of america economist holger schmieding said that the jobless data so far this year had likely been distorted by the unusually mild weather and a new seasonal program to keep people off the dole in the winter .
nevertheless , " the underlying trend in the labor market remains solid , " schmieding said .
" taking the last six months together , unemployment has fallen by a monthly average of 59,000 .
we consider this the underlying trend , which should soon be visible in the headline data again , " he said .
ixis-cib economist sylvain broyer predicted that the jobless figures may move sideways for a few months .
" but we expect the unemployment rate to decline in trend until mid-2008 as the recovery proves to be robust .
indeed , the jobless rate could reach 8.8 percent by the end of this year , " broyer suggested . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reports biggest tax surplus in modern history germany says it expects its biggest tax surplus for half a century as the economy once derided as the " sick man of europe " reaps the benefits from buoyant growth and moderate reforms .

experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .
" you have to be really well positioned in this business , " welfens said .

while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .
" you have to be really well positioned in this business , " welfens said .

" merkel said that while she could make only a " brief assessment , " bush 's remarks were an " important step on the road " to the g8 summit next week in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .
" what is positive is that we can see from the speech given by president bush today that no one can get past climate change , " merkel said .
" it is there .
it is also essentially caused by humankind . "
" that is the shared basis on which we are now acting , " merkel said , although she acknowledged much work had to be done .
the german chancellor also stressed that it was " very important to bring the un into the process .
" but i do see movement on the whole question , " she said .
the united states signed the 1997 un-backed kyoto protocol to limit the emission of greenhouse gases - one of the major causes of global warming - but never ratified the treaty .
a new framework bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush kept quiet on details of the plan in a speech in washington setting out his agenda for the g8 summit , bush said the united states " will work with other nations to establish a new framework on greenhouse gas emissions for when the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 . "
he gave , however , few details and made no mention of mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions such as those contained in the kyoto protocol .
under the us proposal , nations would also develop " mid-term national targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs , " bush said .
the us has argued that it favors using technology to fight global warming rather than imposing emissions limits which could hamper economic growth .
limiting emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will g8 leaders reach agreement behind the fence ?
merkel , on the other hand , has staked germany 's 12-month g8 presidency on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases .
the prospects of that happening at the g8 summit in heiligendamm on the baltic coast appear increasingly slim , with clear differences appearing between g8 nations on how to limit greenhouse gases .
washington has strong objections to the proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for the summit , according to leaked documents .
british prime minister tony blair , however , called bush 's announcement tackling climate change a " big step forward .
" this is what we have been working for , " blair said .
" obviously it 's a big step forward and it sets the right framework for next week 's meeting . "
the g8 summit will be attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
research and development the us president said he would push g8 leaders to boost investment in research and development of environment-friendly technologies , and would help poor countries acquire such cutting-edge science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush banks on clean energy technologies " we 're also going to work to conclude talks with other nations on eliminating tariffs and other barriers to clean energy technologies and services by the end of this year , " he said .
" we 'll help the world 's poorest nations reduce emissions by giving them government-developed technologies at low cost or in some case no cost at all , " said the us president .
amid early media reports of bush 's plan , greenpeace spokesman jörg feddern criticized the proposal as an attempt to undermine the united nations ' kyoto process with its mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions .
" this is fatal for climate protection , " feddern told afp .
the role of emerging economies under the kyoto procotol , 35 industrialized nations that have signed and ratified the pact are required to make targeted cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china so far fails to accept binding targets china and india 's status as developing nations exempts them from mandatory targets on greenhouse gas output , though they are fast becoming big emitters of greenhouse gases as they burn oil , gas and coal to power their economies .
the us administration has cited this as a reason for not submitting the protocol for ratification by the senate .

according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "

bars , cafés and restaurants larger than 50 square meters -lrb- 164 square feet -rrb- with a proper ventilation system can , during a two-year transition period , set up special smoking sections covering half the size of the premises .
in smaller establishments , cigarettes will be prohibited altogether or smoking rooms will have to be built .

setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .

according to the department for promotion of welfare and health , 22 percent of finns smoke , or 24 percent of men and 19 percent of women .
according to simonen " the minimum goal is to go under 20 percent . "
but the nordic state still has some way to go before reaching former prime minister paavo lipponen 's goal of a " zero smoking " population .
he also proposed banning all tobacco products in finland by 2040 .
" a ban would clearly outline the tobacco policy , " lipponen said .
" at the same time it would discourage young people from smoking . "
ireland was the first european state to introduce a complete ban on smoking in public places in march 2004 .
since then norway , italy , malta , sweden , scotland , latvia and lithuania have followed suit .
wales introduced a ban on april 2 , followed by northern ireland on april 30 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 31.05.2007 booming german economy keeps jobless rate at six-year low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's booming economy has created more jobs the current economic boom in germany enabled europe 's biggest economy to hold its jobless rate at the lowest level for six years this month , data showed on thursday . the sunny outlook for the german economy will ensure that the positive trend remains intact in the months to come , analysts said .
according to raw , unadjusted data published by the federal labor agency in nuremberg , the german jobless rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 9.1 percent in may , the lowest level since october 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mild weather is beneficial for the construction industry the overall jobless total declined by 161,000 to 3.806 million , the lowest number of dole-claimers in germany since november 2001 , the figures showed .
unemployment usually falls in the spring thanks to the warmer weather , which is favorable to sectors such as the construction industry .
labor market helped by warm weather adjusted for such seasonal effects , the jobless rate held steady at 9.2 percent , the lowest level since may 2001 , while the adjusted jobless total rose slightly by 3,000 to 3.855 million .
the small upward blip was unexpected - analysts had been penciling in a decline in the adjusted jobless total of around 12,000 this month - but was largely due to the unusually mild winter , which had caused fewer companies to lay off workers during the preceding months , as well as the heavy rain seen this month , analysts said .
" the economic upturn in germany is continuing apace and is helping to stimulate the labor market , " insisted labor office chief frank weise .
weise suggested that the unadjusted jobless total could fall below 3.5 million by the autumn , with the annual average total for the whole of 2007 likely to come out at 3.8-3.9 million .
analysts were similarly unfazed by the slight rise in the adjusted may jobless total this month .
" surveys of hiring intentions remain consistent with solid employment growth so the may figures may have been adversely affected by special factors such as the rainy weather , which has probably hurt activity in retail sales and construction , " said bnp paribas economist , caroline newhouse-cohen .
" all in all , we assume that there is still some scope for further employment growth and decreasing unemployment over the coming months , " the analyst said .
all the right indicators in place indeed , key confidence surveys such as the zew and widely-watched ifo indices suggested that germany , among all the euro-area economies , was likely to prove most resilient to the strong euro , rising interest rates and the slowdown in growth in the united states , newhouse-cohen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines are getting shorter at german labor offices investor confidence , as measured by the monthly zew index , hit an 11-month high in may , while the ifo business climate index held steady just a fraction off its all-time high .
dekabank economist peter leonhardt similarly believed that the upturn on the german labor market " remains intact .
companies ' order books are full and confidence that the economy will continue to prosper is balm for the wounds of the labor market . "
bank of america economist holger schmieding said that the jobless data so far this year had likely been distorted by the unusually mild weather and a new seasonal program to keep people off the dole in the winter .
nevertheless , " the underlying trend in the labor market remains solid , " schmieding said .
" taking the last six months together , unemployment has fallen by a monthly average of 59,000 .
we consider this the underlying trend , which should soon be visible in the headline data again , " he said .
ixis-cib economist sylvain broyer predicted that the jobless figures may move sideways for a few months .
" but we expect the unemployment rate to decline in trend until mid-2008 as the recovery proves to be robust .
indeed , the jobless rate could reach 8.8 percent by the end of this year , " broyer suggested . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reports biggest tax surplus in modern history germany says it expects its biggest tax surplus for half a century as the economy once derided as the " sick man of europe " reaps the benefits from buoyant growth and moderate reforms .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mild weather is beneficial for the construction industry the overall jobless total declined by 161,000 to 3.806 million , the lowest number of dole-claimers in germany since november 2001 , the figures showed .
unemployment usually falls in the spring thanks to the warmer weather , which is favorable to sectors such as the construction industry .
labor market helped by warm weather adjusted for such seasonal effects , the jobless rate held steady at 9.2 percent , the lowest level since may 2001 , while the adjusted jobless total rose slightly by 3,000 to 3.855 million .
the small upward blip was unexpected - analysts had been penciling in a decline in the adjusted jobless total of around 12,000 this month - but was largely due to the unusually mild winter , which had caused fewer companies to lay off workers during the preceding months , as well as the heavy rain seen this month , analysts said .
" the economic upturn in germany is continuing apace and is helping to stimulate the labor market , " insisted labor office chief frank weise .
weise suggested that the unadjusted jobless total could fall below 3.5 million by the autumn , with the annual average total for the whole of 2007 likely to come out at 3.8-3.9 million .
analysts were similarly unfazed by the slight rise in the adjusted may jobless total this month .
" surveys of hiring intentions remain consistent with solid employment growth so the may figures may have been adversely affected by special factors such as the rainy weather , which has probably hurt activity in retail sales and construction , " said bnp paribas economist , caroline newhouse-cohen .
" all in all , we assume that there is still some scope for further employment growth and decreasing unemployment over the coming months , " the analyst said .
all the right indicators in place indeed , key confidence surveys such as the zew and widely-watched ifo indices suggested that germany , among all the euro-area economies , was likely to prove most resilient to the strong euro , rising interest rates and the slowdown in growth in the united states , newhouse-cohen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines are getting shorter at german labor offices investor confidence , as measured by the monthly zew index , hit an 11-month high in may , while the ifo business climate index held steady just a fraction off its all-time high .
dekabank economist peter leonhardt similarly believed that the upturn on the german labor market " remains intact .
companies ' order books are full and confidence that the economy will continue to prosper is balm for the wounds of the labor market . "
bank of america economist holger schmieding said that the jobless data so far this year had likely been distorted by the unusually mild weather and a new seasonal program to keep people off the dole in the winter .
nevertheless , " the underlying trend in the labor market remains solid , " schmieding said .
" taking the last six months together , unemployment has fallen by a monthly average of 59,000 .
we consider this the underlying trend , which should soon be visible in the headline data again , " he said .
ixis-cib economist sylvain broyer predicted that the jobless figures may move sideways for a few months .
" but we expect the unemployment rate to decline in trend until mid-2008 as the recovery proves to be robust .
indeed , the jobless rate could reach 8.8 percent by the end of this year , " broyer suggested . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reports biggest tax surplus in modern history germany says it expects its biggest tax surplus for half a century as the economy once derided as the " sick man of europe " reaps the benefits from buoyant growth and moderate reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 31.05.2007 finland to ban smoking in bars and restaurants on june 1 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu countries have already banned smoking on friday , finland is to become the latest european nation to ban smoking in bars and restaurants , a measure that is expected to be introduced fairly painlessly in the tobacco-critical state . finland already banned smoking in public places in 1977 and in workplaces in 1995 , leaving bars and restaurants as the only sanctuary until now .
according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "
a eurobarometer poll also showed that the complete ban on smoking in all public places is supported by 96 percent of finns , a higher figure than in the rest of europe .
latest attempts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relegated to the outdoors the latest ban is finland 's second bid at prohibiting smoking in bars and restaurants following a failed 1999 attempt .
" back then restaurant owners were very much against it , " simonen said .
" when we prepared the new legislation -lrb- this time -rrb- , we worked together with employers and unions and have reached a consensus . "
bars , cafés and restaurants larger than 50 square meters -lrb- 164 square feet -rrb- with a proper ventilation system can , during a two-year transition period , set up special smoking sections covering half the size of the premises .
in smaller establishments , cigarettes will be prohibited altogether or smoking rooms will have to be built .
the room can not let out any smoke and customers are not allowed to eat or drink in the special booths .
establishments failing to comply with the new law risk a fine as do smokers disobeying the law .
setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .
but the only european nation to meet that target so far is sweden , where 18 percent of people smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland wants to make smoking less " cool " among younth finland is not far behind .
according to the department for promotion of welfare and health , 22 percent of finns smoke , or 24 percent of men and 19 percent of women .
according to simonen " the minimum goal is to go under 20 percent . "
but the nordic state still has some way to go before reaching former prime minister paavo lipponen 's goal of a " zero smoking " population .
he also proposed banning all tobacco products in finland by 2040 .
" a ban would clearly outline the tobacco policy , " lipponen said .
" at the same time it would discourage young people from smoking . "
ireland was the first european state to introduce a complete ban on smoking in public places in march 2004 .
since then norway , italy , malta , sweden , scotland , latvia and lithuania have followed suit .
wales introduced a ban on april 2 , followed by northern ireland on april 30 .
belgium , denmark , england , france , germany , greece , iceland and romania also have similar plans . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's federal states agree smoking ban with exceptions germany 's federal states agreed thursday to ban smoking in restaurants and pubs , but allowed exceptions for small bars and premises with extra smoking rooms .

an increasing number of germans are leaving home and going abroad to live .
in 2006 , emigration was at the highest level since the 1940s . more than 155,000 germans left the country last year , the federal statistics office said .
that 's around seven percent more than in the previous year .
the net emigration of germans last year rose to a post-unification high of 51,906 .
this was up considerably from the previous year .
in 2005 , the gap between the number of germans leaving and returning was 16,764 .
favorite destinations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is the no. 1 destination for german emigrants " switzerland , the us and austria were the top three destinations , " said statistician claire brobecker .
the reasons for these trends is not included in the data received by the federal statistics office .
" we can not measure this on the basis of the information we receive .
it would be mere speculation , " said brobecker .
but the economy in germany has been sluggish in recent years - certainly in comparison with its alpine neighbors .
for the most part , germans are believed to be escaping unemployment or seeking better pay and conditions .
variations in mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of immigrants coming to germany has also sunk the majority of those leaving came from western germany and berlin -lrb- 143,000 -rrb- .
only 12,000 people from former communist eastern germany emigrated .
the proportion of women among the eastern emigrants was higher than among those leaving western germany . the number of immigrants coming to germany , which once drew millions of foreigners in the postwar economic boom years , has also dropped again .
this has been the case since 2001 .
but there are still more foreigners coming to germany than leaving the country .
some 558,000 non-germans moved to the country in 2006 and 484,000 departed .
within germany , the migration from the east to the wealthier west continued , with a net gain to the west of 54,000 people that is similar to recent years . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans go to switzerland videobox -lrb- 20.03.2007 -rrb- how many germans can switzerland take ?
when a swiss tabloid launched a campaign last week asking the nation how many germans switzerland can stomach , it did more to highlight an old inferiority complex than to reveal the dawning of a new anti-german age .
-lrb- 28.02.2007 -rrb- german emigration hits highest level in 55 years germans are moving abroad in record numbers .
according to the latest migration statistics , around 145,000 germans left home for greener pastures last year , the highest tally since 1950 .

with france being the undisputed center of artistic development in the 19th century , the creations of that time laid the foundations of modernity as it dawned before the turn of the century .
monumental highlights of this epoch , such as ingres ' " odalisque in grisaille , " courbet 's " woman with a parrot , " manet 's " boating " , degas ' " the dance class " , monet 's " la grenouillere , " gauguin 's " la orana maria / hail mary " and rodin 's touching sculptures are all brought together for the first time in berlin at the exhibition .

an exception was made by phillipe de montebello , the chief of the met , when plans were drafted for the renovation and enlargement of the 19th century galleries housing the museum 's european collections this summer .
this enabled the stunning collection of french art works to be sent to berlin .
curiously , berlin 's 2004 " moma " exhibition also came about in similar fashion , after the museum of modern art decided its premises also needed enlarging .
raue , a lawyer and the chairman of the city 's " friends of the national gallery foundation " has long enjoyed close collaborative ties with both the met and the museum of modern art in new york .
" we provide each other with generous loans , " raue said .
" we cooperate on exhibitions and both the directors and curators of the two museums know and respect each other . "
crowds expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition is expected to draw large crowds this latest major berlin exhibition is expected to draw huge crowds .
weeks before the official opening , 500 planned guided tours of the exhibition were fully booked out , and 1,500 first-day vip tickets snapped up .
a supplementary french exhibition is now also being staged at the alte nationalgalerie on the city 's museum island .
this museum was the first in germany to take a serious look at french impressionist painting .
already in 1896 , it had acquired a noted work by eduard manet titled " in the wintergarten . "
other paintings by monet , renoir , degas , cezanne and rodin would follow .
violet-colored pigs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " odalisque in grisaille " by jean auguste dominique ingres hugo von tschudi , who was the director of the nationalgalerie from 1896 to 1908 , had an often stormy relationship with german monarch kaiser wilhelm ii over his interest in french impressionist painting .
" please , no violet-colored pigs , " barked the kaiser when von tschudi first met him to talk about art acquisitions in 1896 .
von tschudi , who refused to be brow-beaten , would later establish contact with paul durand-ruel , a paris impressionist art dealer , from whom he secured not only manet 's noted " wintergarten " , but also works by courbet , monet , cezanne and degas for the alte nationalgalerie .
their art clashes later came to a head when the kaiser insisted all art gifts from wealthy patrons must from then on be agreed with him .

experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .

experts believe this to be a sign of the forthcoming shakeup of the telecom market . deutsche telekom said this week that it joined computer-chip maker intel in lending an investment round totaling 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- to jajah , an internet startup that promises to save cash for its users by rerouting their phone calls through the internet .
the actual amount that each company invested has not been revealed .
this is the first time that a traditional telecommunications company such as deutsche telekom invests in a provider of the so-called voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- .
the two branches of the telecommunications industry were previously seen as competitors : more than 4 percent of international phone calls are nowadays conducted via skype - one of the pioneers of competitively priced internet telephony providers .
jajah - which describes itself as a " true ' flat world ' company with very small offices of very dedicated people working around the globe " - was started in 2005 and went live in feb .
2006 .
today , it has more than two million users in 55 countries , and it expects those numbers to increase to five million by the end of the year .
phones are not dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glass-fiber cables can transmit large data packages at speedy rates unlike skype , which lets its users conduct phone calls via computers using headsets , microphones and a special software that needs to be downloaded , jajah asks their users to enter two numbers on their website - their own and the number they wish to call .
the company then calls both numbers and , once the connection is established , both phones ring .
the caller and the party called pick up their phones and can start talking immediately .
" this deal shows that traditional telecom firms need to position themselves , " said justus haucap , a professor of competition theory at the university of bochum .
experts believe that within five years the majority of calls will be made over the internet .
dutch phone company kpn is planning to transmit all its calls over the internet in three years , while deutsche telekom will need a little longer for that - until 2012 .
in slovakia , however , telekom 's daughter company slovakia telecom already has the first internet-based telephone network in the european union .
sinking costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet telephony will make phone bills smaller telecoms see a clear advantage in voip : telephone switches are no longer necessary and networks can be run with fewer resources and much smaller personnel .
while the transmission of a traditional phone call blocks one entire line , thousands of voip conversations can simultaneously travel as data packages across a glass-fiber cable .
customers will hardly notice any difference - except in seeing their phone bills getting smaller .
experts believe that it wo n't take long before everybody starts paying monthly flat rates .
voip is also expected to make a dent on the mobile market .
the widespread adoption of internet telephony and sinking long-distance costs , however , will not only affect the customers .
" they will also have effects on politics , " said paul welfens , a researcher at the university of wuppertal and an expert on structural transformation , innovation and digital economy .
" we wo n't be able to regulate the american and the european markets separately in a meaningful way anymore , " he said .
" we 'll need common rules . "
in addition , the three markets - landline , mobile and internet - which are currently regulated separately , will sooner or later be merged into one .
making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howdy , do you skype ?
it is not yet clear how phone companies will be making money in the future .
potential sources of income include the infrastructure and catering to corporate clients .
according to welfens , services like film archives , information services or other target-specific offers will become increasingly important areas of business .
" we still do n't know if the future world market leader in telephony will be google or microsoft , " welfens said .
" perhaps they have a few ideas up their sleeves . "
it is also not entirely impossible to imagine a scenario in which large players such as telekom are completely driven off the market .
" you have to be really well positioned in this business , " welfens said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moma in berlin " was a real crowd magnet some 1.2 million people flocked to see the hugely successful exhibition .
this time , the debonair art connoisseur secured a five-month loan of some 150 french 19th century art masterpieces belonging to the metropolitan museum of art on new york 's fifth avenue .
paintings by ingres , corot , courbet , puvis de chavannes , manet , degas , pissarro , monet , cezanne , gauguin , bonnard and matisse as well as sculptures by rodin and maillol will go on display at the neue nationalgalerie in berlin from june 1 to oct .
7 .
berlin 's " most beautiful french " exhibition is highlighted by five magnificent paintings by cezanne , eleven by courbet , 12 by degas , and seven by manet .
special halls are dedicated to the work of monet and degas .
nine sculptures by august rodin will also be on view , among them his spectacular " burghers of calais . "
foundations of modernity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the birth of venus " by alexandre cabanel the metropolitan museum of art has long boasted the largest and most significant permanent collection of 19th century french art alongside the musee d 'orsay in paris .
with france being the undisputed center of artistic development in the 19th century , the creations of that time laid the foundations of modernity as it dawned before the turn of the century .
monumental highlights of this epoch , such as ingres ' " odalisque in grisaille , " courbet 's " woman with a parrot , " manet 's " boating " , degas ' " the dance class " , monet 's " la grenouillere , " gauguin 's " la orana maria / hail mary " and rodin 's touching sculptures are all brought together for the first time in berlin at the exhibition .
permission to travel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rodin 's " adam " normally , the met 's prize french works are never allowed to leave the new york museum .
an exception was made by phillipe de montebello , the chief of the met , when plans were drafted for the renovation and enlargement of the 19th century galleries housing the museum 's european collections this summer .
this enabled the stunning collection of french art works to be sent to berlin .
curiously , berlin 's 2004 " moma " exhibition also came about in similar fashion , after the museum of modern art decided its premises also needed enlarging .
raue , a lawyer and the chairman of the city 's " friends of the national gallery foundation " has long enjoyed close collaborative ties with both the met and the museum of modern art in new york .
" we provide each other with generous loans , " raue said .
" we cooperate on exhibitions and both the directors and curators of the two museums know and respect each other . "
crowds expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition is expected to draw large crowds this latest major berlin exhibition is expected to draw huge crowds .
weeks before the official opening , 500 planned guided tours of the exhibition were fully booked out , and 1,500 first-day vip tickets snapped up .
a supplementary french exhibition is now also being staged at the alte nationalgalerie on the city 's museum island .
this museum was the first in germany to take a serious look at french impressionist painting .
already in 1896 , it had acquired a noted work by eduard manet titled " in the wintergarten . "
other paintings by monet , renoir , degas , cezanne and rodin would follow .
violet-colored pigs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " odalisque in grisaille " by jean auguste dominique ingres hugo von tschudi , who was the director of the nationalgalerie from 1896 to 1908 , had an often stormy relationship with german monarch kaiser wilhelm ii over his interest in french impressionist painting .
" please , no violet-colored pigs , " barked the kaiser when von tschudi first met him to talk about art acquisitions in 1896 .
von tschudi , who refused to be brow-beaten , would later establish contact with paul durand-ruel , a paris impressionist art dealer , from whom he secured not only manet 's noted " wintergarten " , but also works by courbet , monet , cezanne and degas for the alte nationalgalerie .
their art clashes later came to a head when the kaiser insisted all art gifts from wealthy patrons must from then on be agreed with him .

some 550 people responded to the ad campaign , which ran under the slogan , “ do you love children more than they want you to ? ”
ninety men were accepted for the initial round of therapy .
on wednesday , researchers said 20 men had successfully completed the therapy so far .
now , 45 men with either a history of child-molestation or an urge to do so , are waiting for a slot in a group slated to start in autumn .
but they may be waiting in vain .
the project is in danger of folding for lack of funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day at the park should be worry-free the idea behind the novel project is aimed at preventing child molestation .
the therapy , developed at the charite clinic , has been co-funded by the child-victim rights group hansel & gretel foundation , and the volkswagen foundation .
no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .
people who took part in the study were promised anonymity .
the message given to the patients was , “ you aren ’ t to blame for your sexual desires , but you are responsible for your sexual actions , ” beier said .
learning what children really want a key part of the course , described by the charite as unique world-wide , is to teach the potential pedophiles , through role-playing , to understand the child 's view and that they only imagined children were offering sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of those with the urge seem to want to fight it " one aim was to teach the pedophile men to clearly pick up their warning signals .
for example these could be thinking about a child often , giving a child presents or inviting a child over , " one therapist , david goecker , told dpa news service .
the men were better able to control their urges after the course of treatment , according to the researchers .
in severe cases , impulse-curbing drugs were prescribed , to improve behavior controls .
there is no guarantee the patients would not molest children in the future , " but we can reduce the risk , " said goecker .
funding is threatened despite the high demand and apparent successes , however , the future of the project is in danger .
the volkswagen foundation has said it would only continue its financing of the project if additional sponsors can be found , hansel & gretel ’ s ceo jerome braun told news agencies .
hansel & gretel chairwoman barbara schäfer-wiegand called upon the german federal ministry for education and research , as well as private donors and foundations , to lend their support to the therapy research . # b # one percent of german men are thought to have pedophilic tendencies , schäfer-wiegand said .
these people need to be exposed to therapy “ before thoughts turn to action . ”
' dark field ' outside the law per year , some 15,000 cases of child sex abuse are reported in germany , but the number of unreported cases is thought to be about four times that .
the project ’ s official name is the dark field prevention project : “ dark field ” standing for the shadowy area outside the legal system where potential child molesters lurk .
the project is aimed at three groups of people : men who have never assaulted a child but fear they may ; men who have already molested a child but were never charged , and those who where charged and completed their sentences , but who fear a relapse . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .
-lrb- 08.01.2007 -rrb- pedophile trial opens in france one of france 's biggest-ever criminal trials - a case in which 66 men and women are accused of raping children " sold " by their parents for small sums of money and cigarettes - has opened in the western city of angers .

no blame for desires the strong response to the study shows how many actual and potential pedophiles want therapy , said klaus beier , director of the institute for sexual medicine at charite .
“ we need to offer men preventive help , so it doesn ’ t come to an assault , ” beier told the associated press .
pedophilic tendencies begin in adolescence and stay with a person for life , he added .
in the therapy , doctors tell their patients that sexual attraction to children is an unalterable part of character , like homosexuality .
people who took part in the study were promised anonymity .
the message given to the patients was , “ you aren ’ t to blame for your sexual desires , but you are responsible for your sexual actions , ” beier said .
learning what children really want a key part of the course , described by the charite as unique world-wide , is to teach the potential pedophiles , through role-playing , to understand the child 's view and that they only imagined children were offering sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of those with the urge seem to want to fight it " one aim was to teach the pedophile men to clearly pick up their warning signals .
for example these could be thinking about a child often , giving a child presents or inviting a child over , " one therapist , david goecker , told dpa news service .
the men were better able to control their urges after the course of treatment , according to the researchers .
in severe cases , impulse-curbing drugs were prescribed , to improve behavior controls .
there is no guarantee the patients would not molest children in the future , " but we can reduce the risk , " said goecker .
funding is threatened despite the high demand and apparent successes , however , the future of the project is in danger .
the volkswagen foundation has said it would only continue its financing of the project if additional sponsors can be found , hansel & gretel ’ s ceo jerome braun told news agencies .
hansel & gretel chairwoman barbara schäfer-wiegand called upon the german federal ministry for education and research , as well as private donors and foundations , to lend their support to the therapy research . # b # one percent of german men are thought to have pedophilic tendencies , schäfer-wiegand said .
these people need to be exposed to therapy “ before thoughts turn to action . ”
' dark field ' outside the law per year , some 15,000 cases of child sex abuse are reported in germany , but the number of unreported cases is thought to be about four times that .
the project ’ s official name is the dark field prevention project : “ dark field ” standing for the shadowy area outside the legal system where potential child molesters lurk .
the project is aimed at three groups of people : men who have never assaulted a child but fear they may ; men who have already molested a child but were never charged , and those who where charged and completed their sentences , but who fear a relapse . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "
a eurobarometer poll also showed that the complete ban on smoking in all public places is supported by 96 percent of finns , a higher figure than in the rest of europe .
latest attempts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relegated to the outdoors the latest ban is finland 's second bid at prohibiting smoking in bars and restaurants following a failed 1999 attempt .
" back then restaurant owners were very much against it , " simonen said .
" when we prepared the new legislation -lrb- this time -rrb- , we worked together with employers and unions and have reached a consensus . "
bars , cafés and restaurants larger than 50 square meters -lrb- 164 square feet -rrb- with a proper ventilation system can , during a two-year transition period , set up special smoking sections covering half the size of the premises .
in smaller establishments , cigarettes will be prohibited altogether or smoking rooms will have to be built .
the room can not let out any smoke and customers are not allowed to eat or drink in the special booths .
establishments failing to comply with the new law risk a fine as do smokers disobeying the law .
setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .
but the only european nation to meet that target so far is sweden , where 18 percent of people smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland wants to make smoking less " cool " among younth finland is not far behind .
according to the department for promotion of welfare and health , 22 percent of finns smoke , or 24 percent of men and 19 percent of women .
according to simonen " the minimum goal is to go under 20 percent . "
but the nordic state still has some way to go before reaching former prime minister paavo lipponen 's goal of a " zero smoking " population .
he also proposed banning all tobacco products in finland by 2040 .
" a ban would clearly outline the tobacco policy , " lipponen said .
" at the same time it would discourage young people from smoking . "
ireland was the first european state to introduce a complete ban on smoking in public places in march 2004 .
since then norway , italy , malta , sweden , scotland , latvia and lithuania have followed suit .
wales introduced a ban on april 2 , followed by northern ireland on april 30 .
belgium , denmark , england , france , germany , greece , iceland and romania also have similar plans . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's federal states agree smoking ban with exceptions germany 's federal states agreed thursday to ban smoking in restaurants and pubs , but allowed exceptions for small bars and premises with extra smoking rooms .

an increasing number of germans are leaving home and going abroad to live .
in 2006 , emigration was at the highest level since the 1940s . more than 155,000 germans left the country last year , the federal statistics office said .
that 's around seven percent more than in the previous year .
the net emigration of germans last year rose to a post-unification high of 51,906 .
this was up considerably from the previous year .
in 2005 , the gap between the number of germans leaving and returning was 16,764 .
favorite destinations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is the no. 1 destination for german emigrants " switzerland , the us and austria were the top three destinations , " said statistician claire brobecker .
the reasons for these trends is not included in the data received by the federal statistics office .
" we can not measure this on the basis of the information we receive .
it would be mere speculation , " said brobecker .
but the economy in germany has been sluggish in recent years - certainly in comparison with its alpine neighbors .
for the most part , germans are believed to be escaping unemployment or seeking better pay and conditions .
variations in mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of immigrants coming to germany has also sunk the majority of those leaving came from western germany and berlin -lrb- 143,000 -rrb- .
only 12,000 people from former communist eastern germany emigrated .
the proportion of women among the eastern emigrants was higher than among those leaving western germany . the number of immigrants coming to germany , which once drew millions of foreigners in the postwar economic boom years , has also dropped again .
this has been the case since 2001 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moma in berlin " was a real crowd magnet some 1.2 million people flocked to see the hugely successful exhibition .
this time , the debonair art connoisseur secured a five-month loan of some 150 french 19th century art masterpieces belonging to the metropolitan museum of art on new york 's fifth avenue .
paintings by ingres , corot , courbet , puvis de chavannes , manet , degas , pissarro , monet , cezanne , gauguin , bonnard and matisse as well as sculptures by rodin and maillol will go on display at the neue nationalgalerie in berlin from june 1 to oct .
7 .
berlin 's " most beautiful french " exhibition is highlighted by five magnificent paintings by cezanne , eleven by courbet , 12 by degas , and seven by manet .
special halls are dedicated to the work of monet and degas .
nine sculptures by august rodin will also be on view , among them his spectacular " burghers of calais . "
foundations of modernity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the birth of venus " by alexandre cabanel the metropolitan museum of art has long boasted the largest and most significant permanent collection of 19th century french art alongside the musee d 'orsay in paris .
with france being the undisputed center of artistic development in the 19th century , the creations of that time laid the foundations of modernity as it dawned before the turn of the century .
monumental highlights of this epoch , such as ingres ' " odalisque in grisaille , " courbet 's " woman with a parrot , " manet 's " boating " , degas ' " the dance class " , monet 's " la grenouillere , " gauguin 's " la orana maria / hail mary " and rodin 's touching sculptures are all brought together for the first time in berlin at the exhibition .
permission to travel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rodin 's " adam " normally , the met 's prize french works are never allowed to leave the new york museum .
an exception was made by phillipe de montebello , the chief of the met , when plans were drafted for the renovation and enlargement of the 19th century galleries housing the museum 's european collections this summer .
this enabled the stunning collection of french art works to be sent to berlin .
curiously , berlin 's 2004 " moma " exhibition also came about in similar fashion , after the museum of modern art decided its premises also needed enlarging .
raue , a lawyer and the chairman of the city 's " friends of the national gallery foundation " has long enjoyed close collaborative ties with both the met and the museum of modern art in new york .
" we provide each other with generous loans , " raue said .
" we cooperate on exhibitions and both the directors and curators of the two museums know and respect each other . "
crowds expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition is expected to draw large crowds this latest major berlin exhibition is expected to draw huge crowds .
weeks before the official opening , 500 planned guided tours of the exhibition were fully booked out , and 1,500 first-day vip tickets snapped up .
a supplementary french exhibition is now also being staged at the alte nationalgalerie on the city 's museum island .
this museum was the first in germany to take a serious look at french impressionist painting .
already in 1896 , it had acquired a noted work by eduard manet titled " in the wintergarten . "
other paintings by monet , renoir , degas , cezanne and rodin would follow .
violet-colored pigs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " odalisque in grisaille " by jean auguste dominique ingres hugo von tschudi , who was the director of the nationalgalerie from 1896 to 1908 , had an often stormy relationship with german monarch kaiser wilhelm ii over his interest in french impressionist painting .
" please , no violet-colored pigs , " barked the kaiser when von tschudi first met him to talk about art acquisitions in 1896 .
von tschudi , who refused to be brow-beaten , would later establish contact with paul durand-ruel , a paris impressionist art dealer , from whom he secured not only manet 's noted " wintergarten " , but also works by courbet , monet , cezanne and degas for the alte nationalgalerie .
their art clashes later came to a head when the kaiser insisted all art gifts from wealthy patrons must from then on be agreed with him .

according to raw , unadjusted data published by the federal labor agency in nuremberg , the german jobless rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 9.1 percent in may , the lowest level since october 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mild weather is beneficial for the construction industry the overall jobless total declined by 161,000 to 3.806 million , the lowest number of dole-claimers in germany since november 2001 , the figures showed .
unemployment usually falls in the spring thanks to the warmer weather , which is favorable to sectors such as the construction industry .
labor market helped by warm weather adjusted for such seasonal effects , the jobless rate held steady at 9.2 percent , the lowest level since may 2001 , while the adjusted jobless total rose slightly by 3,000 to 3.855 million .
the small upward blip was unexpected - analysts had been penciling in a decline in the adjusted jobless total of around 12,000 this month - but was largely due to the unusually mild winter , which had caused fewer companies to lay off workers during the preceding months , as well as the heavy rain seen this month , analysts said .
" the economic upturn in germany is continuing apace and is helping to stimulate the labor market , " insisted labor office chief frank weise .
weise suggested that the unadjusted jobless total could fall below 3.5 million by the autumn , with the annual average total for the whole of 2007 likely to come out at 3.8-3.9 million .
analysts were similarly unfazed by the slight rise in the adjusted may jobless total this month .
" surveys of hiring intentions remain consistent with solid employment growth so the may figures may have been adversely affected by special factors such as the rainy weather , which has probably hurt activity in retail sales and construction , " said bnp paribas economist , caroline newhouse-cohen .
" all in all , we assume that there is still some scope for further employment growth and decreasing unemployment over the coming months , " the analyst said .
all the right indicators in place indeed , key confidence surveys such as the zew and widely-watched ifo indices suggested that germany , among all the euro-area economies , was likely to prove most resilient to the strong euro , rising interest rates and the slowdown in growth in the united states , newhouse-cohen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines are getting shorter at german labor offices investor confidence , as measured by the monthly zew index , hit an 11-month high in may , while the ifo business climate index held steady just a fraction off its all-time high .
dekabank economist peter leonhardt similarly believed that the upturn on the german labor market " remains intact .
companies ' order books are full and confidence that the economy will continue to prosper is balm for the wounds of the labor market . "
bank of america economist holger schmieding said that the jobless data so far this year had likely been distorted by the unusually mild weather and a new seasonal program to keep people off the dole in the winter .
nevertheless , " the underlying trend in the labor market remains solid , " schmieding said .
" taking the last six months together , unemployment has fallen by a monthly average of 59,000 .
we consider this the underlying trend , which should soon be visible in the headline data again , " he said .
ixis-cib economist sylvain broyer predicted that the jobless figures may move sideways for a few months .
" but we expect the unemployment rate to decline in trend until mid-2008 as the recovery proves to be robust .
indeed , the jobless rate could reach 8.8 percent by the end of this year , " broyer suggested . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reports biggest tax surplus in modern history germany says it expects its biggest tax surplus for half a century as the economy once derided as the " sick man of europe " reaps the benefits from buoyant growth and moderate reforms .

according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "
a eurobarometer poll also showed that the complete ban on smoking in all public places is supported by 96 percent of finns , a higher figure than in the rest of europe .
latest attempts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relegated to the outdoors the latest ban is finland 's second bid at prohibiting smoking in bars and restaurants following a failed 1999 attempt .
" back then restaurant owners were very much against it , " simonen said .

bars , cafés and restaurants larger than 50 square meters -lrb- 164 square feet -rrb- with a proper ventilation system can , during a two-year transition period , set up special smoking sections covering half the size of the premises .
in smaller establishments , cigarettes will be prohibited altogether or smoking rooms will have to be built .

establishments failing to comply with the new law risk a fine as do smokers disobeying the law .
setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .
but the only european nation to meet that target so far is sweden , where 18 percent of people smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland wants to make smoking less " cool " among younth finland is not far behind .
according to the department for promotion of welfare and health , 22 percent of finns smoke , or 24 percent of men and 19 percent of women .
according to simonen " the minimum goal is to go under 20 percent . "
but the nordic state still has some way to go before reaching former prime minister paavo lipponen 's goal of a " zero smoking " population .
he also proposed banning all tobacco products in finland by 2040 .
" a ban would clearly outline the tobacco policy , " lipponen said .
" at the same time it would discourage young people from smoking . "
ireland was the first european state to introduce a complete ban on smoking in public places in march 2004 .

according to raw , unadjusted data published by the federal labor agency in nuremberg , the german jobless rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 9.1 percent in may , the lowest level since october 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mild weather is beneficial for the construction industry the overall jobless total declined by 161,000 to 3.806 million , the lowest number of dole-claimers in germany since november 2001 , the figures showed .
unemployment usually falls in the spring thanks to the warmer weather , which is favorable to sectors such as the construction industry .
labor market helped by warm weather adjusted for such seasonal effects , the jobless rate held steady at 9.2 percent , the lowest level since may 2001 , while the adjusted jobless total rose slightly by 3,000 to 3.855 million .
the small upward blip was unexpected - analysts had been penciling in a decline in the adjusted jobless total of around 12,000 this month - but was largely due to the unusually mild winter , which had caused fewer companies to lay off workers during the preceding months , as well as the heavy rain seen this month , analysts said .
" the economic upturn in germany is continuing apace and is helping to stimulate the labor market , " insisted labor office chief frank weise .
weise suggested that the unadjusted jobless total could fall below 3.5 million by the autumn , with the annual average total for the whole of 2007 likely to come out at 3.8-3.9 million .
analysts were similarly unfazed by the slight rise in the adjusted may jobless total this month .

" merkel said that while she could make only a " brief assessment , " bush 's remarks were an " important step on the road " to the g8 summit next week in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .
" what is positive is that we can see from the speech given by president bush today that no one can get past climate change , " merkel said .
" it is there .
it is also essentially caused by humankind . "
" that is the shared basis on which we are now acting , " merkel said , although she acknowledged much work had to be done .
the german chancellor also stressed that it was " very important to bring the un into the process .
" but i do see movement on the whole question , " she said .
the united states signed the 1997 un-backed kyoto protocol to limit the emission of greenhouse gases - one of the major causes of global warming - but never ratified the treaty .
a new framework bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush kept quiet on details of the plan in a speech in washington setting out his agenda for the g8 summit , bush said the united states " will work with other nations to establish a new framework on greenhouse gas emissions for when the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 . "
he gave , however , few details and made no mention of mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions such as those contained in the kyoto protocol .
under the us proposal , nations would also develop " mid-term national targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs , " bush said .
the us has argued that it favors using technology to fight global warming rather than imposing emissions limits which could hamper economic growth .
limiting emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will g8 leaders reach agreement behind the fence ?
merkel , on the other hand , has staked germany 's 12-month g8 presidency on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases .
the prospects of that happening at the g8 summit in heiligendamm on the baltic coast appear increasingly slim , with clear differences appearing between g8 nations on how to limit greenhouse gases .
washington has strong objections to the proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for the summit , according to leaked documents .
british prime minister tony blair , however , called bush 's announcement tackling climate change a " big step forward .
" this is what we have been working for , " blair said .
" obviously it 's a big step forward and it sets the right framework for next week 's meeting . "
the g8 summit will be attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
research and development the us president said he would push g8 leaders to boost investment in research and development of environment-friendly technologies , and would help poor countries acquire such cutting-edge science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush banks on clean energy technologies " we 're also going to work to conclude talks with other nations on eliminating tariffs and other barriers to clean energy technologies and services by the end of this year , " he said .
" we 'll help the world 's poorest nations reduce emissions by giving them government-developed technologies at low cost or in some case no cost at all , " said the us president .
amid early media reports of bush 's plan , greenpeace spokesman jörg feddern criticized the proposal as an attempt to undermine the united nations ' kyoto process with its mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions .
" this is fatal for climate protection , " feddern told afp .
the role of emerging economies under the kyoto procotol , 35 industrialized nations that have signed and ratified the pact are required to make targeted cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china so far fails to accept binding targets china and india 's status as developing nations exempts them from mandatory targets on greenhouse gas output , though they are fast becoming big emitters of greenhouse gases as they burn oil , gas and coal to power their economies .
the us administration has cited this as a reason for not submitting the protocol for ratification by the senate .
this week china and india both signaled that they were not ready to accept binding targets on cutting emissions in the post-kyoto era either . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahead of g8 , us-german tempers fray over green credentials the issue of cutting greenhouse gases is set to prove divisive at the upcoming g8 summit .

" merkel said that while she could make only a " brief assessment , " bush 's remarks were an " important step on the road " to the g8 summit next week in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .
" what is positive is that we can see from the speech given by president bush today that no one can get past climate change , " merkel said .
" it is there .
it is also essentially caused by humankind . "
" that is the shared basis on which we are now acting , " merkel said , although she acknowledged much work had to be done .
the german chancellor also stressed that it was " very important to bring the un into the process .
" but i do see movement on the whole question , " she said .
the united states signed the 1997 un-backed kyoto protocol to limit the emission of greenhouse gases - one of the major causes of global warming - but never ratified the treaty .
a new framework bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush kept quiet on details of the plan in a speech in washington setting out his agenda for the g8 summit , bush said the united states " will work with other nations to establish a new framework on greenhouse gas emissions for when the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 . "
he gave , however , few details and made no mention of mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions such as those contained in the kyoto protocol .
under the us proposal , nations would also develop " mid-term national targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs , " bush said .
the us has argued that it favors using technology to fight global warming rather than imposing emissions limits which could hamper economic growth .
limiting emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will g8 leaders reach agreement behind the fence ?
merkel , on the other hand , has staked germany 's 12-month g8 presidency on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases .
the prospects of that happening at the g8 summit in heiligendamm on the baltic coast appear increasingly slim , with clear differences appearing between g8 nations on how to limit greenhouse gases .
washington has strong objections to the proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for the summit , according to leaked documents .
british prime minister tony blair , however , called bush 's announcement tackling climate change a " big step forward .
" this is what we have been working for , " blair said .
" obviously it 's a big step forward and it sets the right framework for next week 's meeting . "
the g8 summit will be attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 31.05.2007 finland to ban smoking in bars and restaurants on june 1 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu countries have already banned smoking on friday , finland is to become the latest european nation to ban smoking in bars and restaurants , a measure that is expected to be introduced fairly painlessly in the tobacco-critical state . finland already banned smoking in public places in 1977 and in workplaces in 1995 , leaving bars and restaurants as the only sanctuary until now .
according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "
a eurobarometer poll also showed that the complete ban on smoking in all public places is supported by 96 percent of finns , a higher figure than in the rest of europe .
latest attempts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relegated to the outdoors the latest ban is finland 's second bid at prohibiting smoking in bars and restaurants following a failed 1999 attempt .
" back then restaurant owners were very much against it , " simonen said .
" when we prepared the new legislation -lrb- this time -rrb- , we worked together with employers and unions and have reached a consensus . "
bars , cafés and restaurants larger than 50 square meters -lrb- 164 square feet -rrb- with a proper ventilation system can , during a two-year transition period , set up special smoking sections covering half the size of the premises .
in smaller establishments , cigarettes will be prohibited altogether or smoking rooms will have to be built .
the room can not let out any smoke and customers are not allowed to eat or drink in the special booths .
establishments failing to comply with the new law risk a fine as do smokers disobeying the law .
setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .
but the only european nation to meet that target so far is sweden , where 18 percent of people smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland wants to make smoking less " cool " among younth finland is not far behind .
according to the department for promotion of welfare and health , 22 percent of finns smoke , or 24 percent of men and 19 percent of women .
according to simonen " the minimum goal is to go under 20 percent . "
but the nordic state still has some way to go before reaching former prime minister paavo lipponen 's goal of a " zero smoking " population .
he also proposed banning all tobacco products in finland by 2040 .
" a ban would clearly outline the tobacco policy , " lipponen said .
" at the same time it would discourage young people from smoking . "
ireland was the first european state to introduce a complete ban on smoking in public places in march 2004 .
since then norway , italy , malta , sweden , scotland , latvia and lithuania have followed suit .
wales introduced a ban on april 2 , followed by northern ireland on april 30 .
belgium , denmark , england , france , germany , greece , iceland and romania also have similar plans . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's federal states agree smoking ban with exceptions germany 's federal states agreed thursday to ban smoking in restaurants and pubs , but allowed exceptions for small bars and premises with extra smoking rooms .
-lrb- 22.03.2007 -rrb- german states agree on limited smoking ban in restaurants germany 's 16 states agreed friday to a limited smoking ban in restaurants and cafes but left a wide berth for regions to create loopholes .
-lrb- 23.02.2007 -rrb- brussels calls for eu-wide smoking ban the european commission wants all counties in the bloc to prohibit smoking in public places .

the german chancellor also stressed that it was " very important to bring the un into the process .
" but i do see movement on the whole question , " she said .
the united states signed the 1997 un-backed kyoto protocol to limit the emission of greenhouse gases - one of the major causes of global warming - but never ratified the treaty .
a new framework bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush kept quiet on details of the plan in a speech in washington setting out his agenda for the g8 summit , bush said the united states " will work with other nations to establish a new framework on greenhouse gas emissions for when the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 . "
he gave , however , few details and made no mention of mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions such as those contained in the kyoto protocol .
under the us proposal , nations would also develop " mid-term national targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs , " bush said .
the us has argued that it favors using technology to fight global warming rather than imposing emissions limits which could hamper economic growth .
limiting emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will g8 leaders reach agreement behind the fence ?
merkel , on the other hand , has staked germany 's 12-month g8 presidency on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases .
the prospects of that happening at the g8 summit in heiligendamm on the baltic coast appear increasingly slim , with clear differences appearing between g8 nations on how to limit greenhouse gases .
washington has strong objections to the proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for the summit , according to leaked documents .
british prime minister tony blair , however , called bush 's announcement tackling climate change a " big step forward .
" this is what we have been working for , " blair said .
" obviously it 's a big step forward and it sets the right framework for next week 's meeting . "
the g8 summit will be attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
research and development the us president said he would push g8 leaders to boost investment in research and development of environment-friendly technologies , and would help poor countries acquire such cutting-edge science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush banks on clean energy technologies " we 're also going to work to conclude talks with other nations on eliminating tariffs and other barriers to clean energy technologies and services by the end of this year , " he said .
" we 'll help the world 's poorest nations reduce emissions by giving them government-developed technologies at low cost or in some case no cost at all , " said the us president .
amid early media reports of bush 's plan , greenpeace spokesman jörg feddern criticized the proposal as an attempt to undermine the united nations ' kyoto process with its mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions .
" this is fatal for climate protection , " feddern told afp .
the role of emerging economies under the kyoto procotol , 35 industrialized nations that have signed and ratified the pact are required to make targeted cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china so far fails to accept binding targets china and india 's status as developing nations exempts them from mandatory targets on greenhouse gas output , though they are fast becoming big emitters of greenhouse gases as they burn oil , gas and coal to power their economies .
the us administration has cited this as a reason for not submitting the protocol for ratification by the senate .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moma in berlin " was a real crowd magnet some 1.2 million people flocked to see the hugely successful exhibition .
this time , the debonair art connoisseur secured a five-month loan of some 150 french 19th century art masterpieces belonging to the metropolitan museum of art on new york 's fifth avenue .
paintings by ingres , corot , courbet , puvis de chavannes , manet , degas , pissarro , monet , cezanne , gauguin , bonnard and matisse as well as sculptures by rodin and maillol will go on display at the neue nationalgalerie in berlin from june 1 to oct .
7 .
berlin 's " most beautiful french " exhibition is highlighted by five magnificent paintings by cezanne , eleven by courbet , 12 by degas , and seven by manet .
special halls are dedicated to the work of monet and degas .
nine sculptures by august rodin will also be on view , among them his spectacular " burghers of calais . "
foundations of modernity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the birth of venus " by alexandre cabanel the metropolitan museum of art has long boasted the largest and most significant permanent collection of 19th century french art alongside the musee d 'orsay in paris .
with france being the undisputed center of artistic development in the 19th century , the creations of that time laid the foundations of modernity as it dawned before the turn of the century .
monumental highlights of this epoch , such as ingres ' " odalisque in grisaille , " courbet 's " woman with a parrot , " manet 's " boating " , degas ' " the dance class " , monet 's " la grenouillere , " gauguin 's " la orana maria / hail mary " and rodin 's touching sculptures are all brought together for the first time in berlin at the exhibition .
permission to travel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rodin 's " adam " normally , the met 's prize french works are never allowed to leave the new york museum .
an exception was made by phillipe de montebello , the chief of the met , when plans were drafted for the renovation and enlargement of the 19th century galleries housing the museum 's european collections this summer .
this enabled the stunning collection of french art works to be sent to berlin .
curiously , berlin 's 2004 " moma " exhibition also came about in similar fashion , after the museum of modern art decided its premises also needed enlarging .
raue , a lawyer and the chairman of the city 's " friends of the national gallery foundation " has long enjoyed close collaborative ties with both the met and the museum of modern art in new york .
" we provide each other with generous loans , " raue said .
" we cooperate on exhibitions and both the directors and curators of the two museums know and respect each other . "
crowds expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition is expected to draw large crowds this latest major berlin exhibition is expected to draw huge crowds .
weeks before the official opening , 500 planned guided tours of the exhibition were fully booked out , and 1,500 first-day vip tickets snapped up .
a supplementary french exhibition is now also being staged at the alte nationalgalerie on the city 's museum island .
this museum was the first in germany to take a serious look at french impressionist painting .
already in 1896 , it had acquired a noted work by eduard manet titled " in the wintergarten . "
other paintings by monet , renoir , degas , cezanne and rodin would follow .
violet-colored pigs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " odalisque in grisaille " by jean auguste dominique ingres hugo von tschudi , who was the director of the nationalgalerie from 1896 to 1908 , had an often stormy relationship with german monarch kaiser wilhelm ii over his interest in french impressionist painting .
" please , no violet-colored pigs , " barked the kaiser when von tschudi first met him to talk about art acquisitions in 1896 .
von tschudi , who refused to be brow-beaten , would later establish contact with paul durand-ruel , a paris impressionist art dealer , from whom he secured not only manet 's noted " wintergarten " , but also works by courbet , monet , cezanne and degas for the alte nationalgalerie .
their art clashes later came to a head when the kaiser insisted all art gifts from wealthy patrons must from then on be agreed with him .
von tschudi , fed up , left berlin for a new job in munich . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : showcasing germany 's rich art scene a major art show , called made in germany , is opening to the public on friday in the northern german city of hanover .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 31.05.2007 finland to ban smoking in bars and restaurants on june 1 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu countries have already banned smoking on friday , finland is to become the latest european nation to ban smoking in bars and restaurants , a measure that is expected to be introduced fairly painlessly in the tobacco-critical state . finland already banned smoking in public places in 1977 and in workplaces in 1995 , leaving bars and restaurants as the only sanctuary until now .
according to olli simonen of the health ministry 's department for promotion of welfare and health , finns have a largely positive view of the new legislation .
" it looks very promising , " he told afp news agency .
" in a study conducted at the beginning of april , 77 percent of the population was in favor of the new law .
a poll conducted by the european commission one month later showed that 80 percent were in favor . "
a eurobarometer poll also showed that the complete ban on smoking in all public places is supported by 96 percent of finns , a higher figure than in the rest of europe .
latest attempts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relegated to the outdoors the latest ban is finland 's second bid at prohibiting smoking in bars and restaurants following a failed 1999 attempt .
" back then restaurant owners were very much against it , " simonen said .
" when we prepared the new legislation -lrb- this time -rrb- , we worked together with employers and unions and have reached a consensus . "
bars , cafés and restaurants larger than 50 square meters -lrb- 164 square feet -rrb- with a proper ventilation system can , during a two-year transition period , set up special smoking sections covering half the size of the premises .
in smaller establishments , cigarettes will be prohibited altogether or smoking rooms will have to be built .
the room can not let out any smoke and customers are not allowed to eat or drink in the special booths .
establishments failing to comply with the new law risk a fine as do smokers disobeying the law .
setting targets in its fight against tobacco , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has urged countries to try to bring the number of smokers to under 20 percent of the population .
but the only european nation to meet that target so far is sweden , where 18 percent of people smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland wants to make smoking less " cool " among younth finland is not far behind .
according to the department for promotion of welfare and health , 22 percent of finns smoke , or 24 percent of men and 19 percent of women .
according to simonen " the minimum goal is to go under 20 percent . "
but the nordic state still has some way to go before reaching former prime minister paavo lipponen 's goal of a " zero smoking " population .
he also proposed banning all tobacco products in finland by 2040 .
" a ban would clearly outline the tobacco policy , " lipponen said .
" at the same time it would discourage young people from smoking . "
ireland was the first european state to introduce a complete ban on smoking in public places in march 2004 .
since then norway , italy , malta , sweden , scotland , latvia and lithuania have followed suit .
wales introduced a ban on april 2 , followed by northern ireland on april 30 .
belgium , denmark , england , france , germany , greece , iceland and romania also have similar plans . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany 's federal states agree smoking ban with exceptions germany 's federal states agreed thursday to ban smoking in restaurants and pubs , but allowed exceptions for small bars and premises with extra smoking rooms .

sparks are already flying between us and germany , as washington accuses berlin of intolerance towards other viewpoints . us secretary of state condoleezza rice aimed a jab at germany 's environmental credentials wednesday ahead of an expected showdown at next week 's group of eight summit . rice said countries like germany , which prides itself on its green image , should respect the us policy of looking to technology to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions . " one has to wonder if you 're really concerned about greenhouse gas emissions why you are n't interested in nuclear power , " she told reporters at the end of a meeting of g8 foreign ministers in the eastern german city of potsdam .

" we 're seeking to achieve if not agreement then at least a closing of a gap between us .
it 's not an easy issue , " he said .

an increasing number of germans are leaving home and going abroad to live .
in 2006 , emigration was at the highest level since the 1940s . more than 155,000 germans left the country last year , the federal statistics office said .
that 's around seven percent more than in the previous year .
the net emigration of germans last year rose to a post-unification high of 51,906 .
this was up considerably from the previous year .
in 2005 , the gap between the number of germans leaving and returning was 16,764 .
favorite destinations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is the no. 1 destination for german emigrants " switzerland , the us and austria were the top three destinations , " said statistician claire brobecker .
the reasons for these trends is not included in the data received by the federal statistics office .
" we can not measure this on the basis of the information we receive .
it would be mere speculation , " said brobecker .
but the economy in germany has been sluggish in recent years - certainly in comparison with its alpine neighbors .
for the most part , germans are believed to be escaping unemployment or seeking better pay and conditions .
variations in mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of immigrants coming to germany has also sunk the majority of those leaving came from western germany and berlin -lrb- 143,000 -rrb- .
only 12,000 people from former communist eastern germany emigrated .
the proportion of women among the eastern emigrants was higher than among those leaving western germany . the number of immigrants coming to germany , which once drew millions of foreigners in the postwar economic boom years , has also dropped again .
this has been the case since 2001 .
but there are still more foreigners coming to germany than leaving the country .
some 558,000 non-germans moved to the country in 2006 and 484,000 departed .
within germany , the migration from the east to the wealthier west continued , with a net gain to the west of 54,000 people that is similar to recent years . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germans go to switzerland videobox -lrb- 20.03.2007 -rrb- dw-world : how many germans can switzerland take ?
when a swiss tabloid launched a campaign last week asking the nation how many germans switzerland can stomach , it did more to highlight an old inferiority complex than to reveal the dawning of a new anti-german age .
-lrb- 28.02.2007 -rrb- dw-world : german emigration hits highest level in 55 years germans are moving abroad in record numbers .
according to the latest migration statistics , around 145,000 germans left home for greener pastures last year , the highest tally since 1950 .

head teachers will also be given guidance on how to use airport-style metal detectors to screen young people .
the guidelines state that a pupil can be refused entry to a school if he or she refuses to be screened .
education secretary alan johnson said knife-carrying in schools was rare , but it was illegal and a message it would not be tolerated must be sent out .
i think parents will welcome the clear message that bringing a weapon into school is a criminal offence education secretary alan johnson ' why my school uses search wands ' he told the bbc : " what happens at the moment is that if a teacher suspects a child of carrying a knife they have to call the police and wait for the police to arrive before that child can be searched - unless the child agrees to be searched .
" by that time any weapon they are carrying may have been passed on . "
under the new guidelines trained staff , authorised by the head teacher , would be able to carry out searches .
crucially , a search should never take place where there is any risk to staff or pupils .
they also explain how best to screen pupils , suggesting that randomly selected groups of pupils could be searched in order to send out a strong message of deterrence .
but it also sets out limits for schools , in that suspicion has to be reasonable and not based on stereotypical images of certain groups of pupils .
appropriate training two members of staff should be present for a search and both must be the same sex as the pupil .
and students can only be required to remove outer clothing , such as coats or jackets .
mr johnson said teachers themselves had asked for the powers but added that the main way to keep knives out of our schools is to continue educating young people about the dangers associated with them .
" i think parents will welcome the clear message that bringing a weapon into school is a criminal offence and will not be tolerated . "
have your say parents should make sure their children do not leave for school with weapons bill grigg , birmingham send us your comments but he added : " let 's not exaggerate how our schools look at the moment our schools have a very low proportion with any problem at all with pupils bringing in weapons .
" the youth justice board survey told us that , ofsted told us that and head teachers and teachers tell her that .
" lets not exaggerate this into saying our schools are some kind of ghetto from central manhattan or the bronx . "
national association of head teachers spokesman said it was the job of the police to search individuals for weapons .
' fully prepared ' " they are trained and have the appropriate body armour .
" our advice to our members will be to call for police assistance should they suspect that a weapon is being carried . "
general secretary of the nasuwt union , chris keates , welcomed the new powers , but said searches must be conducted properly by appropriately trained staff .
" however , all schools will still need to consider how they will be incorporated into their policies and procedures to ensure that they are prepared fully should the need arise .
" there is a clear role for local authorities and the local police in supporting and advising schools in this process . "
the teacher support network said in the past year its support line had handled 175 calls regarding behaviour management , 30 % of which were concerned specifically with violence , abuse and threats .
" giving teachers facing these issues the power to stop and search pupils may make them feel safer at work though schools must exercise extreme caution , " a spokesman added .

but chad 's best-known - and some would say only - tourist destination is growing in popularity with foreign visitors .
it 's a dangerous life but one we 've accepted nicolai taloua anti-poaching ranger zakouma national park , in the far south well away from the troubles in the east , is becoming something of a mecca for adventurous travellers .
wildlife connoisseurs say it is one of the very best places in africa to view elephants and the fact that it is off the beaten track only adds to the allure .
it is certainly not easy to get to : an 11-hour drive along bumpy dirt tracks may deter the faint-hearted , but the journey is worth it in the end .
zakouma is practically virgin territory : it is not unusual to be one of just two or three tourists in the entire park , with 3,000 sq km of truly wild territory all to oneself .
massive herds luis arranz , a spaniard who has been running zakouma for six years , admits it can be hard drawing in the crowds when media coverage of chad is dominated by violence .
in the last year , more than 200 elephants have been killed " it 's a big problem because there are lots of europeans who 've only read about war and darfur spreading into chad , so people do n't think of coming here for their holiday , " he says .
" but recently people have started to talk about zakouma .
if the situation stays calm , i think people will continue coming . "
the real reason people come to zakouma is for the elephants .
in the rainy season , when elephants begin to leave the park to avoid the muddy terrain , it is possible to see truly massive herds - sometimes up to 1,000 elephants at a time .
unfortunately , like many things in chad , there is a darker side to the picture .
the elephant population here is under threat from ivory poachers .
no ban in the past 12 months , more than 200 elephants have been killed in and around the park , many gunned down in large groups by poachers who attack on horse- and camel-back .
poachers have begun to kill giraffes , as people like to make bracelets out of giraffe tails to give to their wives luis arranz the park employs 80 anti-poaching rangers to deal with the attackers , but it is a bloody and never-ending challenge .
earlier this year , three of the park 's guards were killed in a shoot-out with poachers .
" it 's a dangerous life but one we 've accepted , " says nicolai taloua , head of zakouma 's anti-poaching team .
" we 've chosen this fight and will continue to the end . "
the reason for the recent upsurge in elephant killings is that some african countries -zimbabwe , botswana and namibia - can now legally sell ivory , despite a worldwide ban elsewhere .
chad enforces the ivory ban , but as long as an ivory trade exists , demand in the region continues .
" a few years ago the ivory trade was banned and poaching decreased , " explains mr arranz .
" but recently some african countries struck a deal to export ivory to japan and since then we 've seen an increase in poaching .
" people know zakouma is famous for elephants so that 's a problem for us . "
' it 's a war ' dotted around the park is evidence of the poachers ' handiwork : carcasses of elephants lie rotting , with their faces brutally hacked off in a bid to remove their tusks .
villagers are encouraged to go on safari recently other animals such as giraffes and buffalos have been targeted too .
" poachers have begun to kill giraffes , as people like to make bracelets out of giraffe tails to give to their wives , " says mr arranz .
" it 's ridiculous .
they are trying to kill off all the animals not because of necessity , but because someone wants a little ivory statue or a piece of jewellery . "
" maybe they do n't know how many animals ' lives this cost , or how many people died as well , " he continues .
" really , it 's a war .
and people who buy ivory are causing this war . "
to help in the battle against the ivory trade , the park is trying to keep local villagers onside , not only to better relations but also to encourage people to report sightings of poachers .
as well as building wells and health centres in the area , european union cash is being used to take villagers on safari trips into the park , where they become bona fide tourists for the day .
the park employs 80 anti-poaching rangers " it really helps for villagers to see the wildlife , " says bachir , one of the tour guides .
" sometimes they are ignorant about the park .
but now they are developing a conscience about the animals and are learning what the park can do for them . "
mr arranz says the project also helps break down misconceptions .
" locals always had this idea that the park was built by whites , for whites , " he says .
" but one day we will all leave and this park will be theirs to look after , and that 's what we want to show . "

" poachers have begun to kill giraffes , as people like to make bracelets out of giraffe tails to give to their wives , " says mr arranz .
" it 's ridiculous .
they are trying to kill off all the animals not because of necessity , but because someone wants a little ivory statue or a piece of jewellery . "
" maybe they do n't know how many animals ' lives this cost , or how many people died as well , " he continues .
" really , it 's a war .
and people who buy ivory are causing this war . "
to help in the battle against the ivory trade , the park is trying to keep local villagers onside , not only to better relations but also to encourage people to report sightings of poachers .
as well as building wells and health centres in the area , european union cash is being used to take villagers on safari trips into the park , where they become bona fide tourists for the day .

" sometimes they are ignorant about the park .

mr arranz says the project also helps break down misconceptions .

but chad 's best-known - and some would say only - tourist destination is growing in popularity with foreign visitors .
it 's a dangerous life but one we 've accepted nicolai taloua anti-poaching ranger zakouma national park , in the far south well away from the troubles in the east , is becoming something of a mecca for adventurous travellers .
wildlife connoisseurs say it is one of the very best places in africa to view elephants and the fact that it is off the beaten track only adds to the allure .
it is certainly not easy to get to : an 11-hour drive along bumpy dirt tracks may deter the faint-hearted , but the journey is worth it in the end .
zakouma is practically virgin territory : it is not unusual to be one of just two or three tourists in the entire park , with 3,000 sq km of truly wild territory all to oneself .
massive herds luis arranz , a spaniard who has been running zakouma for six years , admits it can be hard drawing in the crowds when media coverage of chad is dominated by violence .
in the last year , more than 200 elephants have been killed " it 's a big problem because there are lots of europeans who 've only read about war and darfur spreading into chad , so people do n't think of coming here for their holiday , " he says .
" but recently people have started to talk about zakouma .
if the situation stays calm , i think people will continue coming . "
the real reason people come to zakouma is for the elephants .
in the rainy season , when elephants begin to leave the park to avoid the muddy terrain , it is possible to see truly massive herds - sometimes up to 1,000 elephants at a time .
unfortunately , like many things in chad , there is a darker side to the picture .
the elephant population here is under threat from ivory poachers .
no ban in the past 12 months , more than 200 elephants have been killed in and around the park , many gunned down in large groups by poachers who attack on horse- and camel-back .
poachers have begun to kill giraffes , as people like to make bracelets out of giraffe tails to give to their wives luis arranz the park employs 80 anti-poaching rangers to deal with the attackers , but it is a bloody and never-ending challenge .
earlier this year , three of the park 's guards were killed in a shoot-out with poachers .
" it 's a dangerous life but one we 've accepted , " says nicolai taloua , head of zakouma 's anti-poaching team .
" we 've chosen this fight and will continue to the end . "
the reason for the recent upsurge in elephant killings is that some african countries -zimbabwe , botswana and namibia - can now legally sell ivory , despite a worldwide ban elsewhere .
chad enforces the ivory ban , but as long as an ivory trade exists , demand in the region continues .
" a few years ago the ivory trade was banned and poaching decreased , " explains mr arranz .
" but recently some african countries struck a deal to export ivory to japan and since then we 've seen an increase in poaching .
" people know zakouma is famous for elephants so that 's a problem for us . "
' it 's a war ' dotted around the park is evidence of the poachers ' handiwork : carcasses of elephants lie rotting , with their faces brutally hacked off in a bid to remove their tusks .
villagers are encouraged to go on safari recently other animals such as giraffes and buffalos have been targeted too .
" poachers have begun to kill giraffes , as people like to make bracelets out of giraffe tails to give to their wives , " says mr arranz .
" it 's ridiculous .

however , street music will only be heard in daylight hours as a compromise to counter concerns about drunkenness .
the announcement came as the festival launched with the help of festival regular first minister rhodri morgan .
jools holland , mica paris and curtis stigers are confirmed for the festival which takes place between 9-12 august .
the 24th festival will feature 32 concerts , more than 60 stroller events , along with live music and street entertainment in the town centre .
a spokesman for brecon jazz said street performers would remain in the town centre until 1700 or 1800 bst on saturday and sunday .
swing to labour - jazz fan rhodri morgan will launch the event " i think we took the feedback from last year 's event and told ourselves that we did not want to lose that atmosphere in the town centre again , but we also did not want to compromise the safety and enjoyment for visitors and towns people , " he said .
last year around 70,000 revellers came to the town for the annual event , where a ban on town centre musicians was first instigated on a " trial " basis .
there were still some marching and samba bands in other areas of brecon but not at the same level as previous years .
dyfed-powys police said the ban had helped to prevent large build-ups of people in the town centre and this had led to a " relatively quiet weekend " for the force .
masterclass organisers say this year 's festival , which has been sponsored by hsbc once again , will feature several welsh musicians , as well as talent from across the globe .
saxophonist and composer joe lovano will become the festival 's first ever artist-in-residence , a role which will see him perform in a number of different concerts as well as hosting a masterclass for students of the instrument .
jools holland will be joined by lulu for his concert , two-time grammy nominee jessica williams will perform as a soloist , and mercury music prize nominee zoe rahman will be part of the line up .
other performers include two very different piano styles from mose allison and jason rebello , spanish guitarist eduardo niebla and award-winning folk singer june tabor .
the event will be opened by harpist catrin finch .
this will be the final year for walter dickie as brecon jazz chairman , who said the festival was continuing to attract international music talent , as well as providing a stage for home grown talent .
" -lrb- the festival -rrb- brings great economic benefits to the immediate area and to wales , " he said .

japan catches nearly 1,000 whales there each year in the name of research .
after an acrimonious debate , a large number of countries refused to vote , saying the resolution was illegitimate .
there was , however , consensus support for a motion censuring environmental groups which try to hinder japan 's antarctic programme .
both greenpeace and the sea shepherd conservation society have tried to block the programme in recent years , culminating in a damaging collision between japanese and sea shepherd vessels in the recent antarctic season for which each party blames the other .
it was just about the only sign of common ground in a day marked by the entrenched positions and political posturing which has bedevilled this organisation for years .
' stain on the commission ' any international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- member is entitled to hunt whales for scientific research , but anti-whaling countries view the size and scope of japan 's programmes in the antarctic and north pacific as going far beyond what was envisaged when the iwc 's constitution , the international convention for the regulation of whaling , was drawn up in 1946 .
resolutions calling for a halt have materialised regularly .
" every scientific catch is a stain on the record of this commission , " said monaco 's whaling commissioner frederic briand .
" the best thing japan could do is to reduce the size of its scientific whaling programmes around the world . "
the iwc 's scientific committee recently reviewed japan 's antarctic programme , and new zealand 's conservation minister chris carter was not too impressed with their conclusions .
japanese hunters " killed 7,000 whales over 18 years , and could n't even decide how many whales there are , " he fumed .
this was in marked contrast to the st kitts commissioner cedric liburd , who said : " this research provided significant data enabling us to understand the structure and abundance of whale populations . "
every scientific catch is a stain on the record of this commission " frederic briand monaco 's whaling commissioner scientific whaling " i find -lsb- this resolution -rsb- extremely disturbing , vexatious and in some ways irrelevant , " he said .
" it is frivolous , devoid of action and meaningless . "
virtually all of the pro-whaling bloc abstained from the vote , leading to a majority of 40 to 2 .
it makes no material difference , as japan is not obliged to comply .
nevertheless , it is viewed by environmental groups as an important weapon in the battle for hearts and minds .
all at sea environmental organisations greenpeace and sea shepherd came under fire themselves in a resolution co-ordinated by japan and new zealand .
it was the only concrete sign so far of the common ground which both sides said they were seeking before the meeting convened .
the resolution , which says that member governments " do not condone , and in fact condemn , any actions that are a risk to human life and property in relation to the activities of vessels at sea , " passed by consensus .
" we maintain that our protests are peaceful and non-violent , " commented shane rattenbury of greenpeace international .
" greenpeace has 35 years of history of being non-violent ; but i 'm sure the japanese government will attempt to wave it in our face and say ' you should n't be undertaking these protests ' . "
sea shepherd 's record is rather different , having been implicated in attacks on whaling vessels spanning more than two decades .
it is notable that while greenpeace is allowed into the meeting here , sea shepherd is not .
parts of the resolution can also be interpreted as a rebuke to japan , particularly an injunction to " have regard to protecting ... the fragile antarctic environment . "
the meeting looked like running late into its penultimate evening , with several major issues unresolved .

it was the only concrete sign so far of the common ground which both sides said they were seeking before the meeting convened .
people on both sides of the debate talk about their views in detail the resolution , which says that member governments " do not condone , and in fact condemn , any actions that are a risk to human life and property in relation to the activities of vessels at sea , " passed by consensus .
" we maintain that our protests are peaceful and non-violent , " commented shane rattenbury of greenpeace international .
" greenpeace has 35 years of history of being non-violent ; but i 'm sure the japanese government will attempt to wave it in our face and say ' you should n't be undertaking these protests ' . "
sea shepherd 's record is rather different , having been implicated in attacks on whaling vessels spanning more than two decades .
it is notable that while greenpeace is allowed into the meeting here , sea shepherd is not .
parts of the resolution can also be interpreted as a rebuke to japan , particularly an injunction to " have regard to protecting ... the fragile antarctic environment . "
the meeting looked like running late into its penultimate evening , with several major issues unresolved .

the singer , whose real name is george panayitou , has admitted driving while unfit , but says his condition was due to " tiredness and prescribed drugs " .
the 43-year-old was arrested in october 2006 after motorists reported a driver slumped over the wheel of a mercedes at traffic lights in north london .
sentencing has been put back to 8 june .
jail sentence prosecutor andrew torrington told brent magistrates ' court in north london that tests showed a therapeutic quantity of an anti-depressant in the singer 's system as well as the illegal dance club drug ghb .
cannabis was also found in his blood , but the prosecution do not maintain that this was the cause of his intoxication .
michael -lrb- left -rrb- began his pop career as a member of wham !
the star 's lawyer claimed a sleeping drug was the most likely explanation for his condition .
he also told the court it was common for traces of ghb to be found in the blood even if the drug had not been taken .
prosecutors agreed that , while ghb is a banned class c drug , its effects could be created by other substances which are not controlled , including a drug called gbl .
district judge katherine marshall said the issue at stake was not the drug involved , but the condition mr michael was in when he was discovered in his car in october last year .
the bbc 's ben ando , who was at the hearing , said it was made clear that the star could expect to be sentenced at the " upper end of the scale for this offence " .
mr michael , who was not present , has already pleaded guilty to driving while unfit under the influence of drugs , which carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail .
wembley concert at a court appearance earlier this month , the former wham ! frontman addressed district judge katherine marshall directly , saying : " i did something very stupid and i am very ashamed since doing it .
" i 'm not used to defending myself in a position where i am ashamed of something . "
he added : " i really have been very distressed by this whole thing .
i am perfectly aware that i did something very wrong and got into my car when i was unfit to drive . "
since his court appearance , mr michael has revealed he is addicted to prescription drugs and believes the world would be a better place if more people smoked marijuana .
he will attend brent magistrates ' court to receive his sentence on 8 june , one day before he performs the first concert at the new wembley stadium .
' delighted ' after the hearing michael said in a statement : " i have accepted throughout this affair that i was not in a fit state to have been driving a motor vehicle in the early hours of 1 october 2006 and accordingly pleaded guilty to the charge of driving whilst unfit through drink or drugs before brent magistrates ' court on 8 may 2007 .
" i am delighted that at today 's hearing the court accepted that the proper approach to my case is that which i have always maintained , in that i was unfit through a combination of tiredness and prescribed drugs , and that i will be sentenced on this basis .
" i would like to conclude by saying i am really looking forward to playing wembley stadium on 9 and 10 june . "
