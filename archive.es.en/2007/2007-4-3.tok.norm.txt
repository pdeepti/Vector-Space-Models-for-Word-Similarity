but she may have pushed things too far by posing in latex for some seductive photos . pauli rose to prominence in 2006 when she called for generational change at the top of the csu and questioned the status of long-time party leader edmund stoiber , who subsequently had to agree to step down this september . that triumph attracted national media attention to the fifty-year-old local counselor from the town of fürth , whose audacity - and good looks - stood out within a party that usually prides itself on frumpy conservativism . but pauli miscalculated when she posed for a series of sexy photos .

" ms. pauli has become a complete embarrassment , " csu european parliamentary delegate markus ferber told a local bavarian newspaper .

" i see no reason to conceal my femininity , " pauli told the weekly news magazine stern .
" i drive a motorcycle and wear black gloves - is that a reason to quit the party ?
are we living in the middle ages ? " the counselor blames stoiber and his allies for the attacks on her , and the tension is sure to increase later this month as pauli is scheduled to publish a book of caricatures lampooning the often ponderous manner of the csu patriarch . the pictures are softcore at most , but pauli is clearly feeling the sting .
she has said she may now sue the magazine in which the images appeared for not clearing them for publication with her . satisfaction for stoiber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber , who took an elephant ride in asia , may be headed for a comeback edmund stoiber probably regrets not having been in bavaria the past week .
he was on an eleven-day trip through asia when the scandal surrounding his rival broke . " there 's no need for any further commentary , " stoiber said when asked for his reaction to the photos .

it 's a controversial idea that has met a mixed reception so far . kurt beck made his surprising suggestion during his visit to afghanistan at the weekend .
he said there were new impulses to " sound out the possibility of holding another conference , " which would possibly include members of the islamist taliban movement . the spd leader suggested germany as a possible venue for such a meeting and appeared confident that the united states would be prepared to take part . there have been three international conferences in germany on the future of afghanistan over the last six years .
the last one took place in berlin in 2004 .
none have included representatives of the taliban . cautious response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan president is said to favor the suggestion beck 's idea was backed by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who on tuesday for berlin to host an afghan peace conference where taliban moderates could discuss terms with the kabul authorities . spd politician rolf mützenich also praised the idea , saying that a conference involving members of the taliban was necessary to bring stability to the country .
he also noted that afghan president hamid karzai was in favor of a meeting of this kind . but eckart von klaeden , foreign affairs expert for the conservative union bloc , reacted sceptically .
he told the german daily berliner zeitung that the idea was " not particularly well thought through . " von klaeden also expressed concern that inviting the taliban to take part in such a conference " would increase their international status and damage the authority of the elected government of hamid karzai . " smokescreen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck 's idea has n't been welcomed by everyone beck 's proposal comes as germany begins its controversial deployment of tornado jets to afghanistan and some critics have accused the spd leader of mounting smokescreen tactics . on monday , the jets set off from a base in northern germany .
they will provide reconnaissance assistance to isaf peacekeeping troops in the conflict-ridden southern part of afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive by militants . in march , the german parliament approved the mission to send six planes and some 200 military personnel .
a last-minute challenge by the left party to stop the deployment was not successful . surveillance operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornado jets are meant to provide reconnaissance under the mandate , german pilots will pass on intelligence to nato commanders but will not engage in any combat operations .
some opposition members say the mission will inevitably lead to the germans being dragged into fighting . the differences underscore a divide among germans over the country 's military role after more than 50 years of pacifism in the wake of world war two . the tornado mission brings germany 's commitment in afghanistan to about 3,400 personnel , including troops , pilots and technical staff .
but most of them are based in northern afghanistan and are engaged in reconstruction efforts . afghanistan has seen an increase in violence in recent months .
almost 4,000 people were killed in 2006 , the bloodiest year since us-led forces drove the taliban militia from power . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .

maglev trains do n't run on rails but glide on a magnetic field . tgv manufacturer alstom arranged the exploit in order to use extreme conditions to test its latest engineering designs , as well as to display the tgv 's technological prowess to clients in a growing world market . outside france , only south korea has bought tgv trains .
the french manufacturer faces tough competition from german and japanese rivals .
alstom hopes to sell trains to argentina , china , italy and the us state of california . environmentally friendly transport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train travel is an environmentally-friendly alternative to flying california is looking into a possible link between san francisco and los angeles , said fabian nunez , speaker of the california state assembly .
nunez was part of a delegation in france this week to study the trains . " not only are you french people lucky to have the high speed train system , but it also impacts the environment in a positive way , " nunez said . france 's electrically-powered fast trains have been operating since 1981 .
on an average day , the trains reach speeds of 320 kph .
the newest fast line , scheduled to open in july , cuts travel time from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg from four hours to two hours and 20 minutes . it was on a section of the paris-strasbourg line - prepared with extra ballast and boosted overhead electric cables - that tuesday 's speed record was broken .
the special train - dubbed v150 - at one point traveled more than 150 metres per second . the train reached similarly fast speeds in several trial runs over recent weeks , but this was the first test to be officially monitored .
the event was broadcast live in france and germany . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ice trains compete with the french-made tgv " what is important for us today is to prove that the tgv technology which was invented in france 30 years ago is a technology for the future , " said guillaume pepy , director-general of the state rail company sncf , which is tgv 's main customer . japan 's shinkansen " bullet train " and the inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- of the german company siemens are the other major players in a global fast train market that has been boosted recently by environmental concerns about the impact of air transport .
bombardier of canada and talgo of spain are manufacturer high-speed trains . the shinkansen and the ice currently average about 300 kph -lrb- 186 mph -rrb- but a new version of the japanese train , the fastech 360z , is expected to operate at 360kph -lrb- 223.5 mph -rrb- when it enters service .
alstom is preparing a new generation of tgvs - also capable of 360 kph - to come on line from 2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french super-speed train line drives europe 's modernization france cut the ribbon on a super-fast new rail line that will see trains shooting from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg at a record speed of 320 kilometers -lrb- 200 miles -rrb- per hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2007 german parents to get more daycare options großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has a huge lack of daycare spots for kids germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate . reacting to a host of reports and expert commissions that have consistently pointed to the lack of childcare options as a major obstacle for women to have kids , the government on monday said it plans by 2013 to triple the number of day-care spots for young children to 750,000 despite uncertainties about how this will be financed . representatives from regional and local governments met monday to talk about the proposal with ursula von der leyen , germany 's family minister .
participants said they were satisfied with the proposal , after a three hour meeting in berlin . germany a laggard in europe increasing the number of nursery spots would mean that one out of every three german children would have access to a day-care spot , a number von der leyen has pointed out will merely bring germany up to the european average . at present , germany lags behind its european neighbours in providing day care .
figures released by the government show only 13.5 per cent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 per cent . by increasing the number of day care places , germany will reach " european standards , " von der leyen said , stressing that " quick action " was needed because " waiting lists are too long . " government ministers are also hoping that a greater availability of day care places will encourage women to have more children , offsetting a fertility rate of 1.3 children per woman that is one of the lowest in europe . the specifics of how the program will be financed have not been finalized .
von der leyen said there will be federal funding for the childcare plan .
the leaders of the ruling coalition , which is made up of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will discuss the plan later this month . germany 's child-scarce future a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed for reforms von der leyen , a mother of seven herself , recently sparked controversy within the ranks of the cdu with legislation to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities .
the minister wants to ensure that every third child in germany under the age of three will have the chance to attend nursery school . conservatives have criticized the plan as a break with traditional family values .
conservatives feel women should be enouraged to stay at home with their children . when von der leyen first announced her plans earlier this year she saw her popularity rise , but also met with a barrage of criticism from conservative church leaders . the catholic bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , said women were being " degraded into birthing machines , " and called the minister 's idea " blinded by ideology and hostile to children . " besides offering more daycare spots , in january von der leyen also pushed through new legislation that increases the amount of childcare benefits . mothers or fathers now receive two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . yet there 's ongoing concern that german women will continue to choose careers over having children .
a recent study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- shows that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families will have serious long-term repercussions for the economy . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reformist family minister raises hackles in conservative ranks german family minister ursula von der leyen has ruffled quite a few feathers with her plans for radical changes in family policy aimed at reversing the country 's dismally low birth rate .

but she may have pushed things too far by posing in latex for some seductive photos . pauli rose to prominence in 2006 when she called for generational change at the top of the csu and questioned the status of long-time party leader edmund stoiber , who subsequently had to agree to step down this september . that triumph attracted national media attention to the fifty-year-old local counselor from the town of fürth , whose audacity - and good looks - stood out within a party that usually prides itself on frumpy conservativism . but pauli miscalculated when she posed for a series of sexy photos .
the images , published last month in a glossy german monthly , show her wearing an uma-thurman-in-pulp-fiction-style wig and elbow-length , dominatrix-like leather gloves , and displaying a bit of leg atop a massage table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli was a major factor in stoiber 's demise the photos were published under the headline " saint pauli , " a reference to the hamburg neighborhood home to that city 's notorious red-light district . now the dowdy wing of the csu is taking its revenge , suggesting that pauli should be marginalized . " ms. pauli has become a complete embarrassment , " csu european parliamentary delegate markus ferber told a local bavarian newspaper .

" i drive a motorcycle and wear black gloves - is that a reason to quit the party ?
are we living in the middle ages ? " the counselor blames stoiber and his allies for the attacks on her , and the tension is sure to increase later this month as pauli is scheduled to publish a book of caricatures lampooning the often ponderous manner of the csu patriarch . the pictures are softcore at most , but pauli is clearly feeling the sting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.04.2007 french tgv train sets rail speed record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built for speed a french train hit new speed records tuesday near the eastern city of strasbourg , zipping along the tracks at 574.8 kilometers -lrb- 357.2 miles -rrb- per hour .
the company hopes for more international customers . the train is an experimental version of the traine a grande vitesse -lrb- tgv -rrb- , equipped with two supercharged locomotives and extra-large wheels .
it easily beat the previous 515.3 kph record set by a tgv in 1990 . a japanese magnetic levitation , or maglev , train still holds the world train speed record of 581 kph reached in 2003 .
maglev trains do n't run on rails but glide on a magnetic field . tgv manufacturer alstom arranged the exploit in order to use extreme conditions to test its latest engineering designs , as well as to display the tgv 's technological prowess to clients in a growing world market . outside france , only south korea has bought tgv trains .
the french manufacturer faces tough competition from german and japanese rivals .
alstom hopes to sell trains to argentina , china , italy and the us state of california . environmentally friendly transport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train travel is an environmentally-friendly alternative to flying california is looking into a possible link between san francisco and los angeles , said fabian nunez , speaker of the california state assembly .
nunez was part of a delegation in france this week to study the trains . " not only are you french people lucky to have the high speed train system , but it also impacts the environment in a positive way , " nunez said . france 's electrically-powered fast trains have been operating since 1981 .
on an average day , the trains reach speeds of 320 kph .
the newest fast line , scheduled to open in july , cuts travel time from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg from four hours to two hours and 20 minutes . it was on a section of the paris-strasbourg line - prepared with extra ballast and boosted overhead electric cables - that tuesday 's speed record was broken .
the special train - dubbed v150 - at one point traveled more than 150 metres per second . the train reached similarly fast speeds in several trial runs over recent weeks , but this was the first test to be officially monitored .
the event was broadcast live in france and germany . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ice trains compete with the french-made tgv " what is important for us today is to prove that the tgv technology which was invented in france 30 years ago is a technology for the future , " said guillaume pepy , director-general of the state rail company sncf , which is tgv 's main customer . japan 's shinkansen " bullet train " and the inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- of the german company siemens are the other major players in a global fast train market that has been boosted recently by environmental concerns about the impact of air transport .
bombardier of canada and talgo of spain are manufacturer high-speed trains . the shinkansen and the ice currently average about 300 kph -lrb- 186 mph -rrb- but a new version of the japanese train , the fastech 360z , is expected to operate at 360kph -lrb- 223.5 mph -rrb- when it enters service .
alstom is preparing a new generation of tgvs - also capable of 360 kph - to come on line from 2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french super-speed train line drives europe 's modernization france cut the ribbon on a super-fast new rail line that will see trains shooting from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg at a record speed of 320 kilometers -lrb- 200 miles -rrb- per hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors europe -pipe- 03.04.2007 in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say iran 's seizure of british sailors is linked to the nuclear issue as tensions between the britain and iran escalated and the european union jumped into the fray , many are wondering what this latest standoff means for the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program . the communiqués have been flying back and forth and the tone has often been sharp .
one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .
" what we want is a way out of this , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible . "
on monday , both iran and britain signalled possible ways out of the standoff over the naval personnel .
tehran promised to stop airing video confessions and britain said it was willing to discuss ways to avoid future boundary confusion in the persian gulf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign minister margaret beckett wants the issue resolved quickly while a british official told the ap news service that britain still wants the captives freed unconditionally , iranian state-run radio said the confessions by the naval personnel would not be broadcast because of what it called " positive changes " in britain 's negotiating stance .
the radio did not elaborate on the changes . the eu has also asked chief diplomat javier solana to make contact with the iranians and middle east expert reisser says that quiet diplomacy is the best course of action for the europeans . " freezing diplomatic relations would not be wise , " he said .
" it is important to watch developments closely and use quiet channels to keep things from blowing up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2007 german parents to get more daycare options großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has a huge lack of daycare spots for kids germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate . reacting to a host of reports and expert commissions that have consistently pointed to the lack of childcare options as a major obstacle for women to have kids , the government on monday said it plans by 2013 to triple the number of day-care spots for young children to 750,000 despite uncertainties about how this will be financed . representatives from regional and local governments met monday to talk about the proposal with ursula von der leyen , germany 's family minister .
participants said they were satisfied with the proposal , after a three hour meeting in berlin . germany a laggard in europe increasing the number of nursery spots would mean that one out of every three german children would have access to a day-care spot , a number von der leyen has pointed out will merely bring germany up to the european average . at present , germany lags behind its european neighbours in providing day care .
figures released by the government show only 13.5 per cent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 per cent . by increasing the number of day care places , germany will reach " european standards , " von der leyen said , stressing that " quick action " was needed because " waiting lists are too long . " government ministers are also hoping that a greater availability of day care places will encourage women to have more children , offsetting a fertility rate of 1.3 children per woman that is one of the lowest in europe . the specifics of how the program will be financed have not been finalized .
von der leyen said there will be federal funding for the childcare plan .
the leaders of the ruling coalition , which is made up of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will discuss the plan later this month . germany 's child-scarce future a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed for reforms von der leyen , a mother of seven herself , recently sparked controversy within the ranks of the cdu with legislation to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities .
the minister wants to ensure that every third child in germany under the age of three will have the chance to attend nursery school . conservatives have criticized the plan as a break with traditional family values .
conservatives feel women should be enouraged to stay at home with their children . when von der leyen first announced her plans earlier this year she saw her popularity rise , but also met with a barrage of criticism from conservative church leaders . the catholic bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , said women were being " degraded into birthing machines , " and called the minister 's idea " blinded by ideology and hostile to children . " besides offering more daycare spots , in january von der leyen also pushed through new legislation that increases the amount of childcare benefits . mothers or fathers now receive two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . yet there 's ongoing concern that german women will continue to choose careers over having children .
a recent study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- shows that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families will have serious long-term repercussions for the economy . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reformist family minister raises hackles in conservative ranks german family minister ursula von der leyen has ruffled quite a few feathers with her plans for radical changes in family policy aimed at reversing the country 's dismally low birth rate .
-lrb- 10.03.2007 -rrb- value of women at heart of childcare debate should germany triple the number of early child-care spots ?
along with financial questions , the proposal has stirred up an emotional debate over the roles of women and families in german society .

the company hopes for more international customers . the train is an experimental version of the traine a grande vitesse -lrb- tgv -rrb- , equipped with two supercharged locomotives and extra-large wheels .
it easily beat the previous 515.3 kph record set by a tgv in 1990 . a japanese magnetic levitation , or maglev , train still holds the world train speed record of 581 kph reached in 2003 .
maglev trains do n't run on rails but glide on a magnetic field . tgv manufacturer alstom arranged the exploit in order to use extreme conditions to test its latest engineering designs , as well as to display the tgv 's technological prowess to clients in a growing world market . outside france , only south korea has bought tgv trains .
the french manufacturer faces tough competition from german and japanese rivals .
alstom hopes to sell trains to argentina , china , italy and the us state of california . environmentally friendly transport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train travel is an environmentally-friendly alternative to flying california is looking into a possible link between san francisco and los angeles , said fabian nunez , speaker of the california state assembly .
nunez was part of a delegation in france this week to study the trains . " not only are you french people lucky to have the high speed train system , but it also impacts the environment in a positive way , " nunez said . france 's electrically-powered fast trains have been operating since 1981 .
on an average day , the trains reach speeds of 320 kph .
the newest fast line , scheduled to open in july , cuts travel time from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg from four hours to two hours and 20 minutes . it was on a section of the paris-strasbourg line - prepared with extra ballast and boosted overhead electric cables - that tuesday 's speed record was broken .
the special train - dubbed v150 - at one point traveled more than 150 metres per second . the train reached similarly fast speeds in several trial runs over recent weeks , but this was the first test to be officially monitored .
the event was broadcast live in france and germany . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ice trains compete with the french-made tgv " what is important for us today is to prove that the tgv technology which was invented in france 30 years ago is a technology for the future , " said guillaume pepy , director-general of the state rail company sncf , which is tgv 's main customer . japan 's shinkansen " bullet train " and the inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- of the german company siemens are the other major players in a global fast train market that has been boosted recently by environmental concerns about the impact of air transport .
bombardier of canada and talgo of spain are manufacturer high-speed trains . the shinkansen and the ice currently average about 300 kph -lrb- 186 mph -rrb- but a new version of the japanese train , the fastech 360z , is expected to operate at 360kph -lrb- 223.5 mph -rrb- when it enters service .

"
in madrid , acciona said that a joint takeover bid for endesa would be launched with enel " very soon . " last week , the spanish market regulator had ruled that the two firms , which control 46 percent of endesa , should wait six months from the end of the acceptance period for e.on 's bid before launching their own bid .
e.on 's 42-billion-euro bid , which was widely expected to fail , was set to expire on tuesday . " today , e.on signed an agreement with enel and acciona in order to put an end to the substantial uncertainty surrounding the takeover bid for endesa , " e.on said in a statement .
" therefore , e.on will not carry out the takeover bid designed to acquire a majority stake in endesa . " e.on backs down after resistance in spain e.on has raised the value of its initial offer for endesa , made in february last year , three times .
the german group 's efforts have been resisted by the spanish government , which initially favored a rival bid for endesa from spanish utility gas natural . under the deal struck with acciona and enel , e.on will acquire the power utility viesgo from enel in spain , as well as additional generation capacity from endesa . it will make e.on the fourth-biggest energy group in spain with a market share of over 10 percent .

" ms. pauli has become a complete embarrassment , " csu european parliamentary delegate markus ferber told a local bavarian newspaper .
" she 'll no longer be given any positions of responsibility within the csu . " csu general secretary markus söder has also called upon pauli to give up all her party positions . living in the middle ages ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli has gone from being a " beautiful rebel " to a " latex liability " pauli is doing her best to ride out the flap , saying she may still run for the office of deputy leader at the csu party convention this september . " i see no reason to conceal my femininity , " pauli told the weekly news magazine stern .
" i drive a motorcycle and wear black gloves - is that a reason to quit the party ?
are we living in the middle ages ? " the counselor blames stoiber and his allies for the attacks on her , and the tension is sure to increase later this month as pauli is scheduled to publish a book of caricatures lampooning the often ponderous manner of the csu patriarch . the pictures are softcore at most , but pauli is clearly feeling the sting .
she has said she may now sue the magazine in which the images appeared for not clearing them for publication with her . satisfaction for stoiber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber , who took an elephant ride in asia , may be headed for a comeback edmund stoiber probably regrets not having been in bavaria the past week .
he was on an eleven-day trip through asia when the scandal surrounding his rival broke . " there 's no need for any further commentary , " stoiber said when asked for his reaction to the photos .
but a source close to him was quoted as saying : " it 's definitely a point of satisfaction .
the more she makes herself look ridiculous , the better it is for him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors europe -pipe- 03.04.2007 in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say iran 's seizure of british sailors is linked to the nuclear issue as tensions between the britain and iran escalated and the european union jumped into the fray , many are wondering what this latest standoff means for the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program . the communiqués have been flying back and forth and the tone has often been sharp .
one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .
" what we want is a way out of this , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible . "
on monday , both iran and britain signalled possible ways out of the standoff over the naval personnel .
tehran promised to stop airing video confessions and britain said it was willing to discuss ways to avoid future boundary confusion in the persian gulf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign minister margaret beckett wants the issue resolved quickly while a british official told the ap news service that britain still wants the captives freed unconditionally , iranian state-run radio said the confessions by the naval personnel would not be broadcast because of what it called " positive changes " in britain 's negotiating stance .
the radio did not elaborate on the changes . the eu has also asked chief diplomat javier solana to make contact with the iranians and middle east expert reisser says that quiet diplomacy is the best course of action for the europeans . " freezing diplomatic relations would not be wise , " he said .
" it is important to watch developments closely and use quiet channels to keep things from blowing up .

one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .

one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .
" what we want is a way out of this , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible . "
on monday , both iran and britain signalled possible ways out of the standoff over the naval personnel .
tehran promised to stop airing video confessions and britain said it was willing to discuss ways to avoid future boundary confusion in the persian gulf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign minister margaret beckett wants the issue resolved quickly while a british official told the ap news service that britain still wants the captives freed unconditionally , iranian state-run radio said the confessions by the naval personnel would not be broadcast because of what it called " positive changes " in britain 's negotiating stance .
the radio did not elaborate on the changes . the eu has also asked chief diplomat javier solana to make contact with the iranians and middle east expert reisser says that quiet diplomacy is the best course of action for the europeans . " freezing diplomatic relations would not be wise , " he said .
" it is important to watch developments closely and use quiet channels to keep things from blowing up .

participants said they were satisfied with the proposal , after a three hour meeting in berlin . germany a laggard in europe increasing the number of nursery spots would mean that one out of every three german children would have access to a day-care spot , a number von der leyen has pointed out will merely bring germany up to the european average . at present , germany lags behind its european neighbours in providing day care .
figures released by the government show only 13.5 per cent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 per cent . by increasing the number of day care places , germany will reach " european standards , " von der leyen said , stressing that " quick action " was needed because " waiting lists are too long . " government ministers are also hoping that a greater availability of day care places will encourage women to have more children , offsetting a fertility rate of 1.3 children per woman that is one of the lowest in europe . the specifics of how the program will be financed have not been finalized .
von der leyen said there will be federal funding for the childcare plan .

the minister wants to ensure that every third child in germany under the age of three will have the chance to attend nursery school . conservatives have criticized the plan as a break with traditional family values .
conservatives feel women should be enouraged to stay at home with their children . when von der leyen first announced her plans earlier this year she saw her popularity rise , but also met with a barrage of criticism from conservative church leaders . the catholic bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , said women were being " degraded into birthing machines , " and called the minister 's idea " blinded by ideology and hostile to children . " besides offering more daycare spots , in january von der leyen also pushed through new legislation that increases the amount of childcare benefits . mothers or fathers now receive two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . yet there 's ongoing concern that german women will continue to choose careers over having children .

but she may have pushed things too far by posing in latex for some seductive photos . pauli rose to prominence in 2006 when she called for generational change at the top of the csu and questioned the status of long-time party leader edmund stoiber , who subsequently had to agree to step down this september . that triumph attracted national media attention to the fifty-year-old local counselor from the town of fürth , whose audacity - and good looks - stood out within a party that usually prides itself on frumpy conservativism . but pauli miscalculated when she posed for a series of sexy photos .
the images , published last month in a glossy german monthly , show her wearing an uma-thurman-in-pulp-fiction-style wig and elbow-length , dominatrix-like leather gloves , and displaying a bit of leg atop a massage table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli was a major factor in stoiber 's demise the photos were published under the headline " saint pauli , " a reference to the hamburg neighborhood home to that city 's notorious red-light district . now the dowdy wing of the csu is taking its revenge , suggesting that pauli should be marginalized . " ms. pauli has become a complete embarrassment , " csu european parliamentary delegate markus ferber told a local bavarian newspaper .
" she 'll no longer be given any positions of responsibility within the csu . " csu general secretary markus söder has also called upon pauli to give up all her party positions . living in the middle ages ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli has gone from being a " beautiful rebel " to a " latex liability " pauli is doing her best to ride out the flap , saying she may still run for the office of deputy leader at the csu party convention this september . " i see no reason to conceal my femininity , " pauli told the weekly news magazine stern .
" i drive a motorcycle and wear black gloves - is that a reason to quit the party ?
are we living in the middle ages ? " the counselor blames stoiber and his allies for the attacks on her , and the tension is sure to increase later this month as pauli is scheduled to publish a book of caricatures lampooning the often ponderous manner of the csu patriarch . the pictures are softcore at most , but pauli is clearly feeling the sting .
she has said she may now sue the magazine in which the images appeared for not clearing them for publication with her . satisfaction for stoiber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber , who took an elephant ride in asia , may be headed for a comeback edmund stoiber probably regrets not having been in bavaria the past week .
he was on an eleven-day trip through asia when the scandal surrounding his rival broke . " there 's no need for any further commentary , " stoiber said when asked for his reaction to the photos .
but a source close to him was quoted as saying : " it 's definitely a point of satisfaction .
the more she makes herself look ridiculous , the better it is for him .

bayern were thrashed 4-1 in milan at the last 16 stage of last year ’ s champions league .
tuesday ’ s first leg started badly for bayern as andrea pirlo scored his first ever champions league goal to put milan ahead just before half time .
milan looked comfortable but in a sensational end to the game , daniel van buyten equalised for the germans before kaka scored a controversial late penalty to give milan a 2-1 lead .
then in the very last second it was defender van buyten who once again made it two-all .
bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld says his team can never be written off . " bayern munich ’ s stock remains high across europe and the rest of the world and we need to make sure it stays that way .
we can make headlines again in europe and the bundesliga " hitzfeld said .
two away goals put bayern in a commanding position going into the second leg , and the fans , management and players were jubilant at their last-gasp equaliser .
and for one man in particular it was an extra special night .
bayern ’ s regular goalkeeper , oliver kahn was suspended for the match in milan , and his young understudy , michael rensing was making only his second ever champions league appearance .
and rensing rose to the occasion , making a couple of world-class saves .
after the game , rensing was on top of the world .
" the match is being watched all around the world and that ’ s certainly special for me , " he said , adding that even though he 'd played in lots of domestic league and cup games and for the under 21 national side , this game in the champions league was something special .

liverpool took the honours then , and that proved the case again on tuesday .
steven gerrad put the reds in front with a fine header in the 27th minute .
and john arne riise doubled the lead with a spectacular long-range effort in the second half .
peter crouch then wrapped things up with towering header towards the end , to secure a convincing 3-0 away win .
unless psv can come up with a miracle next week , the result should be enough to see liverpool go through to the semi-finals .

bayern were thrashed 4-1 in milan at the last 16 stage of last year ’ s champions league .
tuesday ’ s first leg started badly for bayern as andrea pirlo scored his first ever champions league goal to put milan ahead just before half time .
milan looked comfortable but in a sensational end to the game , daniel van buyten equalised for the germans before kaka scored a controversial late penalty to give milan a 2-1 lead .
then in the very last second it was defender van buyten who once again made it two-all .
bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld says his team can never be written off . " bayern munich ’ s stock remains high across europe and the rest of the world and we need to make sure it stays that way .
we can make headlines again in europe and the bundesliga " hitzfeld said .
two away goals put bayern in a commanding position going into the second leg , and the fans , management and players were jubilant at their last-gasp equaliser .
and for one man in particular it was an extra special night .
bayern ’ s regular goalkeeper , oliver kahn was suspended for the match in milan , and his young understudy , michael rensing was making only his second ever champions league appearance .
and rensing rose to the occasion , making a couple of world-class saves .
after the game , rensing was on top of the world .
" the match is being watched all around the world and that ’ s certainly special for me , " he said , adding that even though he 'd played in lots of domestic league and cup games and for the under 21 national side , this game in the champions league was something special .

liverpool took the honours then , and that proved the case again on tuesday .
steven gerrad put the reds in front with a fine header in the 27th minute .
and john arne riise doubled the lead with a spectacular long-range effort in the second half .
peter crouch then wrapped things up with towering header towards the end , to secure a convincing 3-0 away win .
unless psv can come up with a miracle next week , the result should be enough to see liverpool go through to the semi-finals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors diplomacy -pipe- 03.04.2007 in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say iran 's seizure of british sailors is linked to the nuclear issue as tensions between the britain and iran escalated and the european union jumped into the fray , many are wondering what this latest standoff means for the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program . the communiqués have been flying back and forth and the tone has often been sharp .
one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .

one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.04.2007 french tgv train sets rail speed record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built for speed a french train hit new speed records tuesday near the eastern city of strasbourg , zipping along the tracks at 574.8 kilometers -lrb- 357.2 miles -rrb- per hour .
the company hopes for more international customers . the train is an experimental version of the traine a grande vitesse -lrb- tgv -rrb- , equipped with two supercharged locomotives and extra-large wheels .
it easily beat the previous 515.3 kph record set by a tgv in 1990 . a japanese magnetic levitation , or maglev , train still holds the world train speed record of 581 kph reached in 2003 .
maglev trains do n't run on rails but glide on a magnetic field . tgv manufacturer alstom arranged the exploit in order to use extreme conditions to test its latest engineering designs , as well as to display the tgv 's technological prowess to clients in a growing world market . outside france , only south korea has bought tgv trains .
the french manufacturer faces tough competition from german and japanese rivals .
alstom hopes to sell trains to argentina , china , italy and the us state of california . environmentally friendly transport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train travel is an environmentally-friendly alternative to flying california is looking into a possible link between san francisco and los angeles , said fabian nunez , speaker of the california state assembly .
nunez was part of a delegation in france this week to study the trains . " not only are you french people lucky to have the high speed train system , but it also impacts the environment in a positive way , " nunez said . france 's electrically-powered fast trains have been operating since 1981 .
on an average day , the trains reach speeds of 320 kph .
the newest fast line , scheduled to open in july , cuts travel time from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg from four hours to two hours and 20 minutes . it was on a section of the paris-strasbourg line - prepared with extra ballast and boosted overhead electric cables - that tuesday 's speed record was broken .
the special train - dubbed v150 - at one point traveled more than 150 metres per second . the train reached similarly fast speeds in several trial runs over recent weeks , but this was the first test to be officially monitored .
the event was broadcast live in france and germany . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ice trains compete with the french-made tgv " what is important for us today is to prove that the tgv technology which was invented in france 30 years ago is a technology for the future , " said guillaume pepy , director-general of the state rail company sncf , which is tgv 's main customer . japan 's shinkansen " bullet train " and the inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- of the german company siemens are the other major players in a global fast train market that has been boosted recently by environmental concerns about the impact of air transport .
bombardier of canada and talgo of spain are manufacturer high-speed trains . the shinkansen and the ice currently average about 300 kph -lrb- 186 mph -rrb- but a new version of the japanese train , the fastech 360z , is expected to operate at 360kph -lrb- 223.5 mph -rrb- when it enters service .
alstom is preparing a new generation of tgvs - also capable of 360 kph - to come on line from 2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french super-speed train line drives europe 's modernization france cut the ribbon on a super-fast new rail line that will see trains shooting from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg at a record speed of 320 kilometers -lrb- 200 miles -rrb- per hour .

it easily beat the previous 515.3 kph record set by a tgv in 1990 . a japanese magnetic levitation , or maglev , train still holds the world train speed record of 581 kph reached in 2003 .
maglev trains do n't run on rails but glide on a magnetic field . tgv manufacturer alstom arranged the exploit in order to use extreme conditions to test its latest engineering designs , as well as to display the tgv 's technological prowess to clients in a growing world market . outside france , only south korea has bought tgv trains .

participants said they were satisfied with the proposal , after a three hour meeting in berlin . germany a laggard in europe increasing the number of nursery spots would mean that one out of every three german children would have access to a day-care spot , a number von der leyen has pointed out will merely bring germany up to the european average . at present , germany lags behind its european neighbours in providing day care .
figures released by the government show only 13.5 per cent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 per cent . by increasing the number of day care places , germany will reach " european standards , " von der leyen said , stressing that " quick action " was needed because " waiting lists are too long .

" obtaining a minority interest in endesa would have led to a stalemate between the shareholders and triggered unpredictable lawsuits .
the agreement we have reached with enel and acciona will rapidly establish clarity for everyone involved . " acciona first bought a stake in endesa last september , while enel entered the fray in february , shortly after a spain-italy summit .

"
in madrid , acciona said that a joint takeover bid for endesa would be launched with enel " very soon . " last week , the spanish market regulator had ruled that the two firms , which control 46 percent of endesa , should wait six months from the end of the acceptance period for e.on 's bid before launching their own bid .
e.on 's 42-billion-euro bid , which was widely expected to fail , was set to expire on tuesday . " today , e.on signed an agreement with enel and acciona in order to put an end to the substantial uncertainty surrounding the takeover bid for endesa , " e.on said in a statement .

in italy , the company said it would acquire endesa italia and become the fourth-biggest power producer in the country .

bayern were thrashed 4-1 in milan at the last 16 stage of last year ’ s champions league .
tuesday ’ s first leg started badly for bayern as andrea pirlo scored his first ever champions league goal to put milan ahead just before half time .
milan looked comfortable but in a sensational end to the game , daniel van buyten equalised for the germans before kaka scored a controversial late penalty to give milan a 2-1 lead .
then in the very last second it was defender van buyten who once again made it two-all .
bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld says his team can never be written off . " bayern munich ’ s stock remains high across europe and the rest of the world and we need to make sure it stays that way .
we can make headlines again in europe and the bundesliga " hitzfeld said .
two away goals put bayern in a commanding position going into the second leg , and the fans , management and players were jubilant at their last-gasp equaliser .
and for one man in particular it was an extra special night .
bayern ’ s regular goalkeeper , oliver kahn was suspended for the match in milan , and his young understudy , michael rensing was making only his second ever champions league appearance .
and rensing rose to the occasion , making a couple of world-class saves .
after the game , rensing was on top of the world .
" the match is being watched all around the world and that ’ s certainly special for me , " he said , adding that even though he 'd played in lots of domestic league and cup games and for the under 21 national side , this game in the champions league was something special .

liverpool took the honours then , and that proved the case again on tuesday .
steven gerrad put the reds in front with a fine header in the 27th minute .
and john arne riise doubled the lead with a spectacular long-range effort in the second half .
peter crouch then wrapped things up with towering header towards the end , to secure a convincing 3-0 away win .
unless psv can come up with a miracle next week , the result should be enough to see liverpool go through to the semi-finals .
they ’ ll have a clearer idea of who they ’ ll face in the next round after the remaining quarter-final first legs are played out on wednesday , with roma hosting manchester united , and valencia taking on chelsea . rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic champions league 22.11 dw-radio : newslink feedback send us an e-mail .

bayern were thrashed 4-1 in milan at the last 16 stage of last year ’ s champions league .
tuesday ’ s first leg started badly for bayern as andrea pirlo scored his first ever champions league goal to put milan ahead just before half time .
milan looked comfortable but in a sensational end to the game , daniel van buyten equalised for the germans before kaka scored a controversial late penalty to give milan a 2-1 lead .
then in the very last second it was defender van buyten who once again made it two-all .
bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld says his team can never be written off . " bayern munich ’ s stock remains high across europe and the rest of the world and we need to make sure it stays that way .
we can make headlines again in europe and the bundesliga " hitzfeld said .
two away goals put bayern in a commanding position going into the second leg , and the fans , management and players were jubilant at their last-gasp equaliser .
and for one man in particular it was an extra special night .
bayern ’ s regular goalkeeper , oliver kahn was suspended for the match in milan , and his young understudy , michael rensing was making only his second ever champions league appearance .
and rensing rose to the occasion , making a couple of world-class saves .
after the game , rensing was on top of the world .
" the match is being watched all around the world and that ’ s certainly special for me , " he said , adding that even though he 'd played in lots of domestic league and cup games and for the under 21 national side , this game in the champions league was something special .
in the night ’ s other game psv eindhoven and liverpool renewed their acquantaince , after having already played each other in the group stages .
liverpool took the honours then , and that proved the case again on tuesday .
steven gerrad put the reds in front with a fine header in the 27th minute .
and john arne riise doubled the lead with a spectacular long-range effort in the second half .
peter crouch then wrapped things up with towering header towards the end , to secure a convincing 3-0 away win .
unless psv can come up with a miracle next week , the result should be enough to see liverpool go through to the semi-finals .
they ’ ll have a clearer idea of who they ’ ll face in the next round after the remaining quarter-final first legs are played out on wednesday , with roma hosting manchester united , and valencia taking on chelsea . rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic champions league 22.11 dw-radio : newslink 9798 dw-tv europe live motor mobil we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

"
in madrid , acciona said that a joint takeover bid for endesa would be launched with enel " very soon . " last week , the spanish market regulator had ruled that the two firms , which control 46 percent of endesa , should wait six months from the end of the acceptance period for e.on 's bid before launching their own bid .
e.on 's 42-billion-euro bid , which was widely expected to fail , was set to expire on tuesday . " today , e.on signed an agreement with enel and acciona in order to put an end to the substantial uncertainty surrounding the takeover bid for endesa , " e.on said in a statement .
" therefore , e.on will not carry out the takeover bid designed to acquire a majority stake in endesa . " e.on backs down after resistance in spain e.on has raised the value of its initial offer for endesa , made in february last year , three times .
the german group 's efforts have been resisted by the spanish government , which initially favored a rival bid for endesa from spanish utility gas natural . under the deal struck with acciona and enel , e.on will acquire the power utility viesgo from enel in spain , as well as additional generation capacity from endesa . it will make e.on the fourth-biggest energy group in spain with a market share of over 10 percent .
in italy , the company said it would acquire endesa italia and become the fourth-biggest power producer in the country .

" acciona and enel 's involvement in endesa has made our original goal of acquiring a majority stake in endesa impossible , " he said .
" obtaining a minority interest in endesa would have led to a stalemate between the shareholders and triggered unpredictable lawsuits .
the agreement we have reached with enel and acciona will rapidly establish clarity for everyone involved . " acciona first bought a stake in endesa last september , while enel entered the fray in february , shortly after a spain-italy summit .
the timing of the move by enel led to suggestions that a joint takeover by acciona and enel had been instigated by the spanish government . spain clashes with eu regulators over protectionist claims madrid has been fighting tooth and nail to keep e.on from taking over endesa , even though eu competition regulators have approved the deal . the e.on-endesa case has been widely seen in brussels as a flagrant example of protectionism by spain . the european commission , which polices competition policy in the eu , opened a second lawsuit on wednesday because spain had defied its repeated requests for madrid to lift conditions it had imposed on e.on 's bid for endesa . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes spain to court over endesa takeover battle the european commission has said it will take spain to the eu 's court of justice over failure to drop conditions imposed on german energy group e.on 's billion euro bid for spain 's biggest company endesa sa .

it 's a controversial idea that has met a mixed reception so far . kurt beck made his surprising suggestion during his visit to afghanistan at the weekend .
he said there were new impulses to " sound out the possibility of holding another conference , " which would possibly include members of the islamist taliban movement . the spd leader suggested germany as a possible venue for such a meeting and appeared confident that the united states would be prepared to take part . there have been three international conferences in germany on the future of afghanistan over the last six years .

he also noted that afghan president hamid karzai was in favor of a meeting of this kind . but eckart von klaeden , foreign affairs expert for the conservative union bloc , reacted sceptically .
he told the german daily berliner zeitung that the idea was " not particularly well thought through . " von klaeden also expressed concern that inviting the taliban to take part in such a conference " would increase their international status and damage the authority of the elected government of hamid karzai .

they will provide reconnaissance assistance to isaf peacekeeping troops in the conflict-ridden southern part of afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive by militants . in march , the german parliament approved the mission to send six planes and some 200 military personnel .

but most of them are based in northern afghanistan and are engaged in reconstruction efforts . afghanistan has seen an increase in violence in recent months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors europe -pipe- 03.04.2007 in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say iran 's seizure of british sailors is linked to the nuclear issue as tensions between the britain and iran escalated and the european union jumped into the fray , many are wondering what this latest standoff means for the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program . the communiqués have been flying back and forth and the tone has often been sharp .
one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .
" what we want is a way out of this , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible . "
on monday , both iran and britain signalled possible ways out of the standoff over the naval personnel .
tehran promised to stop airing video confessions and britain said it was willing to discuss ways to avoid future boundary confusion in the persian gulf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign minister margaret beckett wants the issue resolved quickly while a british official told the ap news service that britain still wants the captives freed unconditionally , iranian state-run radio said the confessions by the naval personnel would not be broadcast because of what it called " positive changes " in britain 's negotiating stance .
the radio did not elaborate on the changes . the eu has also asked chief diplomat javier solana to make contact with the iranians and middle east expert reisser says that quiet diplomacy is the best course of action for the europeans . " freezing diplomatic relations would not be wise , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors europe -pipe- 03.04.2007 in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say iran 's seizure of british sailors is linked to the nuclear issue as tensions between the britain and iran escalated and the european union jumped into the fray , many are wondering what this latest standoff means for the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program . the communiqués have been flying back and forth and the tone has often been sharp .
one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .
" what we want is a way out of this , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible . "
on monday , both iran and britain signalled possible ways out of the standoff over the naval personnel .
tehran promised to stop airing video confessions and britain said it was willing to discuss ways to avoid future boundary confusion in the persian gulf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign minister margaret beckett wants the issue resolved quickly while a british official told the ap news service that britain still wants the captives freed unconditionally , iranian state-run radio said the confessions by the naval personnel would not be broadcast because of what it called " positive changes " in britain 's negotiating stance .
the radio did not elaborate on the changes . the eu has also asked chief diplomat javier solana to make contact with the iranians and middle east expert reisser says that quiet diplomacy is the best course of action for the europeans . " freezing diplomatic relations would not be wise , " he said .

one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .
" what we want is a way out of this , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible . "
on monday , both iran and britain signalled possible ways out of the standoff over the naval personnel .
tehran promised to stop airing video confessions and britain said it was willing to discuss ways to avoid future boundary confusion in the persian gulf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign minister margaret beckett wants the issue resolved quickly while a british official told the ap news service that britain still wants the captives freed unconditionally , iranian state-run radio said the confessions by the naval personnel would not be broadcast because of what it called " positive changes " in britain 's negotiating stance .
the radio did not elaborate on the changes . the eu has also asked chief diplomat javier solana to make contact with the iranians and middle east expert reisser says that quiet diplomacy is the best course of action for the europeans . " freezing diplomatic relations would not be wise , " he said .

it 's a controversial idea that has met a mixed reception so far . kurt beck made his surprising suggestion during his visit to afghanistan at the weekend .
he said there were new impulses to " sound out the possibility of holding another conference , " which would possibly include members of the islamist taliban movement . the spd leader suggested germany as a possible venue for such a meeting and appeared confident that the united states would be prepared to take part . there have been three international conferences in germany on the future of afghanistan over the last six years .
the last one took place in berlin in 2004 .
none have included representatives of the taliban . cautious response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan president is said to favor the suggestion beck 's idea was backed by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who on tuesday for berlin to host an afghan peace conference where taliban moderates could discuss terms with the kabul authorities . spd politician rolf mützenich also praised the idea , saying that a conference involving members of the taliban was necessary to bring stability to the country .
he also noted that afghan president hamid karzai was in favor of a meeting of this kind . but eckart von klaeden , foreign affairs expert for the conservative union bloc , reacted sceptically .
he told the german daily berliner zeitung that the idea was " not particularly well thought through . " von klaeden also expressed concern that inviting the taliban to take part in such a conference " would increase their international status and damage the authority of the elected government of hamid karzai . " smokescreen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck 's idea has n't been welcomed by everyone beck 's proposal comes as germany begins its controversial deployment of tornado jets to afghanistan and some critics have accused the spd leader of mounting smokescreen tactics . on monday , the jets set off from a base in northern germany .
they will provide reconnaissance assistance to isaf peacekeeping troops in the conflict-ridden southern part of afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive by militants . in march , the german parliament approved the mission to send six planes and some 200 military personnel .

some opposition members say the mission will inevitably lead to the germans being dragged into fighting . the differences underscore a divide among germans over the country 's military role after more than 50 years of pacifism in the wake of world war two . the tornado mission brings germany 's commitment in afghanistan to about 3,400 personnel , including troops , pilots and technical staff .
but most of them are based in northern afghanistan and are engaged in reconstruction efforts . afghanistan has seen an increase in violence in recent months .
almost 4,000 people were killed in 2006 , the bloodiest year since us-led forces drove the taliban militia from power . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .

the company hopes for more international customers . the train is an experimental version of the traine a grande vitesse -lrb- tgv -rrb- , equipped with two supercharged locomotives and extra-large wheels .
it easily beat the previous 515.3 kph record set by a tgv in 1990 . a japanese magnetic levitation , or maglev , train still holds the world train speed record of 581 kph reached in 2003 .
maglev trains do n't run on rails but glide on a magnetic field . tgv manufacturer alstom arranged the exploit in order to use extreme conditions to test its latest engineering designs , as well as to display the tgv 's technological prowess to clients in a growing world market . outside france , only south korea has bought tgv trains .
the french manufacturer faces tough competition from german and japanese rivals .
alstom hopes to sell trains to argentina , china , italy and the us state of california . environmentally friendly transport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train travel is an environmentally-friendly alternative to flying california is looking into a possible link between san francisco and los angeles , said fabian nunez , speaker of the california state assembly .
nunez was part of a delegation in france this week to study the trains . " not only are you french people lucky to have the high speed train system , but it also impacts the environment in a positive way , " nunez said . france 's electrically-powered fast trains have been operating since 1981 .
on an average day , the trains reach speeds of 320 kph .
the newest fast line , scheduled to open in july , cuts travel time from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg from four hours to two hours and 20 minutes . it was on a section of the paris-strasbourg line - prepared with extra ballast and boosted overhead electric cables - that tuesday 's speed record was broken .
the special train - dubbed v150 - at one point traveled more than 150 metres per second . the train reached similarly fast speeds in several trial runs over recent weeks , but this was the first test to be officially monitored .
the event was broadcast live in france and germany . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ice trains compete with the french-made tgv " what is important for us today is to prove that the tgv technology which was invented in france 30 years ago is a technology for the future , " said guillaume pepy , director-general of the state rail company sncf , which is tgv 's main customer . japan 's shinkansen " bullet train " and the inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- of the german company siemens are the other major players in a global fast train market that has been boosted recently by environmental concerns about the impact of air transport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2007 german parents to get more daycare options großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has a huge lack of daycare spots for kids germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate . reacting to a host of reports and expert commissions that have consistently pointed to the lack of childcare options as a major obstacle for women to have kids , the government on monday said it plans by 2013 to triple the number of day-care spots for young children to 750,000 despite uncertainties about how this will be financed . representatives from regional and local governments met monday to talk about the proposal with ursula von der leyen , germany 's family minister .
participants said they were satisfied with the proposal , after a three hour meeting in berlin . germany a laggard in europe increasing the number of nursery spots would mean that one out of every three german children would have access to a day-care spot , a number von der leyen has pointed out will merely bring germany up to the european average . at present , germany lags behind its european neighbours in providing day care .
figures released by the government show only 13.5 per cent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 per cent . by increasing the number of day care places , germany will reach " european standards , " von der leyen said , stressing that " quick action " was needed because " waiting lists are too long . " government ministers are also hoping that a greater availability of day care places will encourage women to have more children , offsetting a fertility rate of 1.3 children per woman that is one of the lowest in europe . the specifics of how the program will be financed have not been finalized .
von der leyen said there will be federal funding for the childcare plan .
the leaders of the ruling coalition , which is made up of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will discuss the plan later this month . germany 's child-scarce future a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed for reforms von der leyen , a mother of seven herself , recently sparked controversy within the ranks of the cdu with legislation to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities .
the minister wants to ensure that every third child in germany under the age of three will have the chance to attend nursery school . conservatives have criticized the plan as a break with traditional family values .
conservatives feel women should be enouraged to stay at home with their children . when von der leyen first announced her plans earlier this year she saw her popularity rise , but also met with a barrage of criticism from conservative church leaders . the catholic bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , said women were being " degraded into birthing machines , " and called the minister 's idea " blinded by ideology and hostile to children . " besides offering more daycare spots , in january von der leyen also pushed through new legislation that increases the amount of childcare benefits . mothers or fathers now receive two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . yet there 's ongoing concern that german women will continue to choose careers over having children .
a recent study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- shows that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families will have serious long-term repercussions for the economy . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reformist family minister raises hackles in conservative ranks german family minister ursula von der leyen has ruffled quite a few feathers with her plans for radical changes in family policy aimed at reversing the country 's dismally low birth rate .

participants said they were satisfied with the proposal , after a three hour meeting in berlin . germany a laggard in europe increasing the number of nursery spots would mean that one out of every three german children would have access to a day-care spot , a number von der leyen has pointed out will merely bring germany up to the european average . at present , germany lags behind its european neighbours in providing day care .
figures released by the government show only 13.5 per cent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 per cent . by increasing the number of day care places , germany will reach " european standards , " von der leyen said , stressing that " quick action " was needed because " waiting lists are too long . " government ministers are also hoping that a greater availability of day care places will encourage women to have more children , offsetting a fertility rate of 1.3 children per woman that is one of the lowest in europe . the specifics of how the program will be financed have not been finalized .
von der leyen said there will be federal funding for the childcare plan .

conservatives feel women should be enouraged to stay at home with their children . when von der leyen first announced her plans earlier this year she saw her popularity rise , but also met with a barrage of criticism from conservative church leaders . the catholic bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , said women were being " degraded into birthing machines , " and called the minister 's idea " blinded by ideology and hostile to children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2007 german parents to get more daycare options großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has a huge lack of daycare spots for kids germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate . reacting to a host of reports and expert commissions that have consistently pointed to the lack of childcare options as a major obstacle for women to have kids , the government on monday said it plans by 2013 to triple the number of day-care spots for young children to 750,000 despite uncertainties about how this will be financed . representatives from regional and local governments met monday to talk about the proposal with ursula von der leyen , germany 's family minister .
participants said they were satisfied with the proposal , after a three hour meeting in berlin . germany a laggard in europe increasing the number of nursery spots would mean that one out of every three german children would have access to a day-care spot , a number von der leyen has pointed out will merely bring germany up to the european average . at present , germany lags behind its european neighbours in providing day care .
figures released by the government show only 13.5 per cent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 per cent . by increasing the number of day care places , germany will reach " european standards , " von der leyen said , stressing that " quick action " was needed because " waiting lists are too long . " government ministers are also hoping that a greater availability of day care places will encourage women to have more children , offsetting a fertility rate of 1.3 children per woman that is one of the lowest in europe . the specifics of how the program will be financed have not been finalized .
von der leyen said there will be federal funding for the childcare plan .
the leaders of the ruling coalition , which is made up of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will discuss the plan later this month . germany 's child-scarce future a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed for reforms von der leyen , a mother of seven herself , recently sparked controversy within the ranks of the cdu with legislation to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities .
the minister wants to ensure that every third child in germany under the age of three will have the chance to attend nursery school . conservatives have criticized the plan as a break with traditional family values .
conservatives feel women should be enouraged to stay at home with their children . when von der leyen first announced her plans earlier this year she saw her popularity rise , but also met with a barrage of criticism from conservative church leaders . the catholic bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , said women were being " degraded into birthing machines , " and called the minister 's idea " blinded by ideology and hostile to children . " besides offering more daycare spots , in january von der leyen also pushed through new legislation that increases the amount of childcare benefits . mothers or fathers now receive two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . yet there 's ongoing concern that german women will continue to choose careers over having children .
a recent study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- shows that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families will have serious long-term repercussions for the economy . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reformist family minister raises hackles in conservative ranks german family minister ursula von der leyen has ruffled quite a few feathers with her plans for radical changes in family policy aimed at reversing the country 's dismally low birth rate .

along with financial questions , the proposal has stirred up an emotional debate over the roles of women and families in german society .

"
in madrid , acciona said that a joint takeover bid for endesa would be launched with enel " very soon . " last week , the spanish market regulator had ruled that the two firms , which control 46 percent of endesa , should wait six months from the end of the acceptance period for e.on 's bid before launching their own bid .
e.on 's 42-billion-euro bid , which was widely expected to fail , was set to expire on tuesday . " today , e.on signed an agreement with enel and acciona in order to put an end to the substantial uncertainty surrounding the takeover bid for endesa , " e.on said in a statement .
" therefore , e.on will not carry out the takeover bid designed to acquire a majority stake in endesa . " e.on backs down after resistance in spain e.on has raised the value of its initial offer for endesa , made in february last year , three times .
the german group 's efforts have been resisted by the spanish government , which initially favored a rival bid for endesa from spanish utility gas natural . under the deal struck with acciona and enel , e.on will acquire the power utility viesgo from enel in spain , as well as additional generation capacity from endesa . it will make e.on the fourth-biggest energy group in spain with a market share of over 10 percent .
in italy , the company said it would acquire endesa italia and become the fourth-biggest power producer in the country .
in france , it is expecting to become the third-biggest player in the electricity generation sector through the acquisition of endesa france / snet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on ceo wulf bernotat said the decision was made in order to avoid a stalemate and possible lawsuits e.on 's chief executive , wulf bernotat , said the company had realised that it would not achieve its aim of securing a majority stake in endesa and taking a minority stake would have created a stalemate . " acciona and enel 's involvement in endesa has made our original goal of acquiring a majority stake in endesa impossible , " he said .
" obtaining a minority interest in endesa would have led to a stalemate between the shareholders and triggered unpredictable lawsuits .
the agreement we have reached with enel and acciona will rapidly establish clarity for everyone involved . " acciona first bought a stake in endesa last september , while enel entered the fray in february , shortly after a spain-italy summit .
the timing of the move by enel led to suggestions that a joint takeover by acciona and enel had been instigated by the spanish government . spain clashes with eu regulators over protectionist claims madrid has been fighting tooth and nail to keep e.on from taking over endesa , even though eu competition regulators have approved the deal . the e.on-endesa case has been widely seen in brussels as a flagrant example of protectionism by spain . the european commission , which polices competition policy in the eu , opened a second lawsuit on wednesday because spain had defied its repeated requests for madrid to lift conditions it had imposed on e.on 's bid for endesa . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes spain to court over endesa takeover battle the european commission has said it will take spain to the eu 's court of justice over failure to drop conditions imposed on german energy group e.on 's billion euro bid for spain 's biggest company endesa sa .
-lrb- 28.03.2007 -rrb- endesa bidding war heats up as board backs e.on german energy giant e.on ag scored a key victory monday in its long-running battle for control of endesa after the spanish power company 's board backed its 42.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.5 billion -rrb- to take over the group .
-lrb- 26.03.2007 -rrb- e.on calls for european energy market , lowers endesa bid the head of germany 's largest energy concern , e.on , has called for a european energy market , grouping germany and six of its neighbors .
the company also watered down its bid for the planned takeover of spanish endesa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors diplomacy -pipe- 03.04.2007 in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say iran 's seizure of british sailors is linked to the nuclear issue as tensions between the britain and iran escalated and the european union jumped into the fray , many are wondering what this latest standoff means for the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program . the communiqués have been flying back and forth and the tone has often been sharp .
one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .
" what we want is a way out of this , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible . "
on monday , both iran and britain signalled possible ways out of the standoff over the naval personnel .
tehran promised to stop airing video confessions and britain said it was willing to discuss ways to avoid future boundary confusion in the persian gulf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign minister margaret beckett wants the issue resolved quickly while a british official told the ap news service that britain still wants the captives freed unconditionally , iranian state-run radio said the confessions by the naval personnel would not be broadcast because of what it called " positive changes " in britain 's negotiating stance .
the radio did not elaborate on the changes . the eu has also asked chief diplomat javier solana to make contact with the iranians and middle east expert reisser says that quiet diplomacy is the best course of action for the europeans . " freezing diplomatic relations would not be wise , " he said .
" it is important to watch developments closely and use quiet channels to keep things from blowing up .

participants said they were satisfied with the proposal , after a three hour meeting in berlin . germany a laggard in europe increasing the number of nursery spots would mean that one out of every three german children would have access to a day-care spot , a number von der leyen has pointed out will merely bring germany up to the european average . at present , germany lags behind its european neighbours in providing day care .
figures released by the government show only 13.5 per cent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 per cent . by increasing the number of day care places , germany will reach " european standards , " von der leyen said , stressing that " quick action " was needed because " waiting lists are too long . " government ministers are also hoping that a greater availability of day care places will encourage women to have more children , offsetting a fertility rate of 1.3 children per woman that is one of the lowest in europe . the specifics of how the program will be financed have not been finalized .
von der leyen said there will be federal funding for the childcare plan .

the minister wants to ensure that every third child in germany under the age of three will have the chance to attend nursery school . conservatives have criticized the plan as a break with traditional family values .
conservatives feel women should be enouraged to stay at home with their children . when von der leyen first announced her plans earlier this year she saw her popularity rise , but also met with a barrage of criticism from conservative church leaders . the catholic bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , said women were being " degraded into birthing machines , " and called the minister 's idea " blinded by ideology and hostile to children . " besides offering more daycare spots , in january von der leyen also pushed through new legislation that increases the amount of childcare benefits . mothers or fathers now receive two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . yet there 's ongoing concern that german women will continue to choose careers over having children .

but she may have pushed things too far by posing in latex for some seductive photos . pauli rose to prominence in 2006 when she called for generational change at the top of the csu and questioned the status of long-time party leader edmund stoiber , who subsequently had to agree to step down this september . that triumph attracted national media attention to the fifty-year-old local counselor from the town of fürth , whose audacity - and good looks - stood out within a party that usually prides itself on frumpy conservativism . but pauli miscalculated when she posed for a series of sexy photos .
the images , published last month in a glossy german monthly , show her wearing an uma-thurman-in-pulp-fiction-style wig and elbow-length , dominatrix-like leather gloves , and displaying a bit of leg atop a massage table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli was a major factor in stoiber 's demise the photos were published under the headline " saint pauli , " a reference to the hamburg neighborhood home to that city 's notorious red-light district . now the dowdy wing of the csu is taking its revenge , suggesting that pauli should be marginalized .

"
in madrid , acciona said that a joint takeover bid for endesa would be launched with enel " very soon . " last week , the spanish market regulator had ruled that the two firms , which control 46 percent of endesa , should wait six months from the end of the acceptance period for e.on 's bid before launching their own bid .
e.on 's 42-billion-euro bid , which was widely expected to fail , was set to expire on tuesday . " today , e.on signed an agreement with enel and acciona in order to put an end to the substantial uncertainty surrounding the takeover bid for endesa , " e.on said in a statement .
" therefore , e.on will not carry out the takeover bid designed to acquire a majority stake in endesa . " e.on backs down after resistance in spain e.on has raised the value of its initial offer for endesa , made in february last year , three times .
the german group 's efforts have been resisted by the spanish government , which initially favored a rival bid for endesa from spanish utility gas natural . under the deal struck with acciona and enel , e.on will acquire the power utility viesgo from enel in spain , as well as additional generation capacity from endesa . it will make e.on the fourth-biggest energy group in spain with a market share of over 10 percent .
in italy , the company said it would acquire endesa italia and become the fourth-biggest power producer in the country .
in france , it is expecting to become the third-biggest player in the electricity generation sector through the acquisition of endesa france / snet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on ceo wulf bernotat said the decision was made in order to avoid a stalemate and possible lawsuits e.on 's chief executive , wulf bernotat , said the company had realised that it would not achieve its aim of securing a majority stake in endesa and taking a minority stake would have created a stalemate . " acciona and enel 's involvement in endesa has made our original goal of acquiring a majority stake in endesa impossible , " he said .
" obtaining a minority interest in endesa would have led to a stalemate between the shareholders and triggered unpredictable lawsuits .
the agreement we have reached with enel and acciona will rapidly establish clarity for everyone involved . " acciona first bought a stake in endesa last september , while enel entered the fray in february , shortly after a spain-italy summit .
the timing of the move by enel led to suggestions that a joint takeover by acciona and enel had been instigated by the spanish government . spain clashes with eu regulators over protectionist claims madrid has been fighting tooth and nail to keep e.on from taking over endesa , even though eu competition regulators have approved the deal . the e.on-endesa case has been widely seen in brussels as a flagrant example of protectionism by spain . the european commission , which polices competition policy in the eu , opened a second lawsuit on wednesday because spain had defied its repeated requests for madrid to lift conditions it had imposed on e.on 's bid for endesa . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes spain to court over endesa takeover battle the european commission has said it will take spain to the eu 's court of justice over failure to drop conditions imposed on german energy group e.on 's billion euro bid for spain 's biggest company endesa sa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors europe -pipe- 03.04.2007 in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say iran 's seizure of british sailors is linked to the nuclear issue as tensions between the britain and iran escalated and the european union jumped into the fray , many are wondering what this latest standoff means for the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program . the communiqués have been flying back and forth and the tone has often been sharp .
one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .
" what we want is a way out of this , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible . "
on monday , both iran and britain signalled possible ways out of the standoff over the naval personnel .
tehran promised to stop airing video confessions and britain said it was willing to discuss ways to avoid future boundary confusion in the persian gulf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign minister margaret beckett wants the issue resolved quickly while a british official told the ap news service that britain still wants the captives freed unconditionally , iranian state-run radio said the confessions by the naval personnel would not be broadcast because of what it called " positive changes " in britain 's negotiating stance .
the radio did not elaborate on the changes . the eu has also asked chief diplomat javier solana to make contact with the iranians and middle east expert reisser says that quiet diplomacy is the best course of action for the europeans . " freezing diplomatic relations would not be wise , " he said .

it 's a controversial idea that has met a mixed reception so far . kurt beck made his surprising suggestion during his visit to afghanistan at the weekend .
he said there were new impulses to " sound out the possibility of holding another conference , " which would possibly include members of the islamist taliban movement . the spd leader suggested germany as a possible venue for such a meeting and appeared confident that the united states would be prepared to take part . there have been three international conferences in germany on the future of afghanistan over the last six years .
the last one took place in berlin in 2004 .
none have included representatives of the taliban . cautious response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan president is said to favor the suggestion beck 's idea was backed by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who on tuesday for berlin to host an afghan peace conference where taliban moderates could discuss terms with the kabul authorities . spd politician rolf mützenich also praised the idea , saying that a conference involving members of the taliban was necessary to bring stability to the country .
he also noted that afghan president hamid karzai was in favor of a meeting of this kind . but eckart von klaeden , foreign affairs expert for the conservative union bloc , reacted sceptically .
he told the german daily berliner zeitung that the idea was " not particularly well thought through . " von klaeden also expressed concern that inviting the taliban to take part in such a conference " would increase their international status and damage the authority of the elected government of hamid karzai . " smokescreen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck 's idea has n't been welcomed by everyone beck 's proposal comes as germany begins its controversial deployment of tornado jets to afghanistan and some critics have accused the spd leader of mounting smokescreen tactics . on monday , the jets set off from a base in northern germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors europe -pipe- 03.04.2007 in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say iran 's seizure of british sailors is linked to the nuclear issue as tensions between the britain and iran escalated and the european union jumped into the fray , many are wondering what this latest standoff means for the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program . the communiqués have been flying back and forth and the tone has often been sharp .
one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .
" what we want is a way out of this , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible . "
on monday , both iran and britain signalled possible ways out of the standoff over the naval personnel .
tehran promised to stop airing video confessions and britain said it was willing to discuss ways to avoid future boundary confusion in the persian gulf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign minister margaret beckett wants the issue resolved quickly while a british official told the ap news service that britain still wants the captives freed unconditionally , iranian state-run radio said the confessions by the naval personnel would not be broadcast because of what it called " positive changes " in britain 's negotiating stance .
the radio did not elaborate on the changes . the eu has also asked chief diplomat javier solana to make contact with the iranians and middle east expert reisser says that quiet diplomacy is the best course of action for the europeans . " freezing diplomatic relations would not be wise , " he said .
" it is important to watch developments closely and use quiet channels to keep things from blowing up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors europe -pipe- 03.04.2007 in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say iran 's seizure of british sailors is linked to the nuclear issue as tensions between the britain and iran escalated and the european union jumped into the fray , many are wondering what this latest standoff means for the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program . the communiqués have been flying back and forth and the tone has often been sharp .
one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .
" what we want is a way out of this , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible . "
on monday , both iran and britain signalled possible ways out of the standoff over the naval personnel .
tehran promised to stop airing video confessions and britain said it was willing to discuss ways to avoid future boundary confusion in the persian gulf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign minister margaret beckett wants the issue resolved quickly while a british official told the ap news service that britain still wants the captives freed unconditionally , iranian state-run radio said the confessions by the naval personnel would not be broadcast because of what it called " positive changes " in britain 's negotiating stance .
the radio did not elaborate on the changes . the eu has also asked chief diplomat javier solana to make contact with the iranians and middle east expert reisser says that quiet diplomacy is the best course of action for the europeans . " freezing diplomatic relations would not be wise , " he said .
" it is important to watch developments closely and use quiet channels to keep things from blowing up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.04.2007 french tgv train sets rail speed record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built for speed a french train hit new speed records tuesday near the eastern city of strasbourg , zipping along the tracks at 574.8 kilometers -lrb- 357.2 miles -rrb- per hour .
the company hopes for more international customers . the train is an experimental version of the traine a grande vitesse -lrb- tgv -rrb- , equipped with two supercharged locomotives and extra-large wheels .
it easily beat the previous 515.3 kph record set by a tgv in 1990 . a japanese magnetic levitation , or maglev , train still holds the world train speed record of 581 kph reached in 2003 .
maglev trains do n't run on rails but glide on a magnetic field . tgv manufacturer alstom arranged the exploit in order to use extreme conditions to test its latest engineering designs , as well as to display the tgv 's technological prowess to clients in a growing world market . outside france , only south korea has bought tgv trains .
the french manufacturer faces tough competition from german and japanese rivals .
alstom hopes to sell trains to argentina , china , italy and the us state of california . environmentally friendly transport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train travel is an environmentally-friendly alternative to flying california is looking into a possible link between san francisco and los angeles , said fabian nunez , speaker of the california state assembly .
nunez was part of a delegation in france this week to study the trains . " not only are you french people lucky to have the high speed train system , but it also impacts the environment in a positive way , " nunez said . france 's electrically-powered fast trains have been operating since 1981 .
on an average day , the trains reach speeds of 320 kph .
the newest fast line , scheduled to open in july , cuts travel time from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg from four hours to two hours and 20 minutes . it was on a section of the paris-strasbourg line - prepared with extra ballast and boosted overhead electric cables - that tuesday 's speed record was broken .
the special train - dubbed v150 - at one point traveled more than 150 metres per second . the train reached similarly fast speeds in several trial runs over recent weeks , but this was the first test to be officially monitored .
the event was broadcast live in france and germany . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ice trains compete with the french-made tgv " what is important for us today is to prove that the tgv technology which was invented in france 30 years ago is a technology for the future , " said guillaume pepy , director-general of the state rail company sncf , which is tgv 's main customer . japan 's shinkansen " bullet train " and the inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- of the german company siemens are the other major players in a global fast train market that has been boosted recently by environmental concerns about the impact of air transport .
bombardier of canada and talgo of spain are manufacturer high-speed trains . the shinkansen and the ice currently average about 300 kph -lrb- 186 mph -rrb- but a new version of the japanese train , the fastech 360z , is expected to operate at 360kph -lrb- 223.5 mph -rrb- when it enters service .
alstom is preparing a new generation of tgvs - also capable of 360 kph - to come on line from 2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french super-speed train line drives europe 's modernization france cut the ribbon on a super-fast new rail line that will see trains shooting from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg at a record speed of 320 kilometers -lrb- 200 miles -rrb- per hour .
-lrb- 16.03.2007 -rrb- germany optimistic about train technology despite setback after a german maglev train crash , industry experts are optimistic that the technology remains attractive to investors , especially those who wish to expand the transrapid system in china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors europe -pipe- 03.04.2007 in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say iran 's seizure of british sailors is linked to the nuclear issue as tensions between the britain and iran escalated and the european union jumped into the fray , many are wondering what this latest standoff means for the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program . the communiqués have been flying back and forth and the tone has often been sharp .
one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .
" what we want is a way out of this , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible . "
on monday , both iran and britain signalled possible ways out of the standoff over the naval personnel .
tehran promised to stop airing video confessions and britain said it was willing to discuss ways to avoid future boundary confusion in the persian gulf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign minister margaret beckett wants the issue resolved quickly while a british official told the ap news service that britain still wants the captives freed unconditionally , iranian state-run radio said the confessions by the naval personnel would not be broadcast because of what it called " positive changes " in britain 's negotiating stance .
the radio did not elaborate on the changes . the eu has also asked chief diplomat javier solana to make contact with the iranians and middle east expert reisser says that quiet diplomacy is the best course of action for the europeans . " freezing diplomatic relations would not be wise , " he said .
" it is important to watch developments closely and use quiet channels to keep things from blowing up .

" the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .
" what we want is a way out of this , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible . "
on monday , both iran and britain signalled possible ways out of the standoff over the naval personnel .
tehran promised to stop airing video confessions and britain said it was willing to discuss ways to avoid future boundary confusion in the persian gulf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign minister margaret beckett wants the issue resolved quickly while a british official told the ap news service that britain still wants the captives freed unconditionally , iranian state-run radio said the confessions by the naval personnel would not be broadcast because of what it called " positive changes " in britain 's negotiating stance .
the radio did not elaborate on the changes . the eu has also asked chief diplomat javier solana to make contact with the iranians and middle east expert reisser says that quiet diplomacy is the best course of action for the europeans . " freezing diplomatic relations would not be wise , " he said .

he also noted that afghan president hamid karzai was in favor of a meeting of this kind . but eckart von klaeden , foreign affairs expert for the conservative union bloc , reacted sceptically .

participants said they were satisfied with the proposal , after a three hour meeting in berlin . germany a laggard in europe increasing the number of nursery spots would mean that one out of every three german children would have access to a day-care spot , a number von der leyen has pointed out will merely bring germany up to the european average . at present , germany lags behind its european neighbours in providing day care .
figures released by the government show only 13.5 per cent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 per cent . by increasing the number of day care places , germany will reach " european standards , " von der leyen said , stressing that " quick action " was needed because " waiting lists are too long . " government ministers are also hoping that a greater availability of day care places will encourage women to have more children , offsetting a fertility rate of 1.3 children per woman that is one of the lowest in europe . the specifics of how the program will be financed have not been finalized .
von der leyen said there will be federal funding for the childcare plan .
the leaders of the ruling coalition , which is made up of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will discuss the plan later this month . germany 's child-scarce future a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed for reforms von der leyen , a mother of seven herself , recently sparked controversy within the ranks of the cdu with legislation to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities .
the minister wants to ensure that every third child in germany under the age of three will have the chance to attend nursery school . conservatives have criticized the plan as a break with traditional family values .
conservatives feel women should be enouraged to stay at home with their children . when von der leyen first announced her plans earlier this year she saw her popularity rise , but also met with a barrage of criticism from conservative church leaders . the catholic bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , said women were being " degraded into birthing machines , " and called the minister 's idea " blinded by ideology and hostile to children . " besides offering more daycare spots , in january von der leyen also pushed through new legislation that increases the amount of childcare benefits . mothers or fathers now receive two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . yet there 's ongoing concern that german women will continue to choose careers over having children .

figures released by the government show only 13.5 per cent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 per cent . by increasing the number of day care places , germany will reach " european standards , " von der leyen said , stressing that " quick action " was needed because " waiting lists are too long . " government ministers are also hoping that a greater availability of day care places will encourage women to have more children , offsetting a fertility rate of 1.3 children per woman that is one of the lowest in europe . the specifics of how the program will be financed have not been finalized .
von der leyen said there will be federal funding for the childcare plan .

the minister wants to ensure that every third child in germany under the age of three will have the chance to attend nursery school . conservatives have criticized the plan as a break with traditional family values .
conservatives feel women should be enouraged to stay at home with their children . when von der leyen first announced her plans earlier this year she saw her popularity rise , but also met with a barrage of criticism from conservative church leaders . the catholic bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , said women were being " degraded into birthing machines , " and called the minister 's idea " blinded by ideology and hostile to children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors europe -pipe- 03.04.2007 in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say iran 's seizure of british sailors is linked to the nuclear issue as tensions between the britain and iran escalated and the european union jumped into the fray , many are wondering what this latest standoff means for the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program . the communiqués have been flying back and forth and the tone has often been sharp .
one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .
" what we want is a way out of this , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible . "
on monday , both iran and britain signalled possible ways out of the standoff over the naval personnel .
tehran promised to stop airing video confessions and britain said it was willing to discuss ways to avoid future boundary confusion in the persian gulf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign minister margaret beckett wants the issue resolved quickly while a british official told the ap news service that britain still wants the captives freed unconditionally , iranian state-run radio said the confessions by the naval personnel would not be broadcast because of what it called " positive changes " in britain 's negotiating stance .
the radio did not elaborate on the changes . the eu has also asked chief diplomat javier solana to make contact with the iranians and middle east expert reisser says that quiet diplomacy is the best course of action for the europeans . " freezing diplomatic relations would not be wise , " he said .
" it is important to watch developments closely and use quiet channels to keep things from blowing up .

the company hopes for more international customers . the train is an experimental version of the traine a grande vitesse -lrb- tgv -rrb- , equipped with two supercharged locomotives and extra-large wheels .
it easily beat the previous 515.3 kph record set by a tgv in 1990 . a japanese magnetic levitation , or maglev , train still holds the world train speed record of 581 kph reached in 2003 .
maglev trains do n't run on rails but glide on a magnetic field . tgv manufacturer alstom arranged the exploit in order to use extreme conditions to test its latest engineering designs , as well as to display the tgv 's technological prowess to clients in a growing world market . outside france , only south korea has bought tgv trains .
the french manufacturer faces tough competition from german and japanese rivals .
alstom hopes to sell trains to argentina , china , italy and the us state of california . environmentally friendly transport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train travel is an environmentally-friendly alternative to flying california is looking into a possible link between san francisco and los angeles , said fabian nunez , speaker of the california state assembly .
nunez was part of a delegation in france this week to study the trains . " not only are you french people lucky to have the high speed train system , but it also impacts the environment in a positive way , " nunez said . france 's electrically-powered fast trains have been operating since 1981 .
on an average day , the trains reach speeds of 320 kph .
the newest fast line , scheduled to open in july , cuts travel time from paris to the eastern city of strasbourg from four hours to two hours and 20 minutes . it was on a section of the paris-strasbourg line - prepared with extra ballast and boosted overhead electric cables - that tuesday 's speed record was broken .
the special train - dubbed v150 - at one point traveled more than 150 metres per second . the train reached similarly fast speeds in several trial runs over recent weeks , but this was the first test to be officially monitored .
the event was broadcast live in france and germany . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ice trains compete with the french-made tgv " what is important for us today is to prove that the tgv technology which was invented in france 30 years ago is a technology for the future , " said guillaume pepy , director-general of the state rail company sncf , which is tgv 's main customer . japan 's shinkansen " bullet train " and the inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- of the german company siemens are the other major players in a global fast train market that has been boosted recently by environmental concerns about the impact of air transport .
bombardier of canada and talgo of spain are manufacturer high-speed trains . the shinkansen and the ice currently average about 300 kph -lrb- 186 mph -rrb- but a new version of the japanese train , the fastech 360z , is expected to operate at 360kph -lrb- 223.5 mph -rrb- when it enters service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors europe -pipe- 03.04.2007 in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say iran 's seizure of british sailors is linked to the nuclear issue as tensions between the britain and iran escalated and the european union jumped into the fray , many are wondering what this latest standoff means for the long-running dispute over iran 's nuclear program . the communiqués have been flying back and forth and the tone has often been sharp .
one of the latest rounds in the dispute over 15 british soldiers taken into iranian custody involved a strongly worded condemnation by the european union and a sharp response from iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , hosting eu foreign ministers in bremen saturday , called for the immediate release of the sailors and expressed the bloc 's solidarity over the issue .
" we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the united kingdom , " he told reporters . tehran countered with a warning for the eu to stay out of it . " the european union foreign ministers must seriously avoid irresponsible and imprudent reactions over the bilateral dispute between tehran and london , " read a statement released by iranian foreign ministry officials . ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said monday that the european union had " started to condemn iran without knowing the facts " over the sailors ' capture . he criticized the eu 's expression last week of " unconditional support " for britain 's position and its threat of " appropriate measures " unless the captives were released quickly , in an interview with britain 's channel four news . but behind the posturing in this latest diplomatic clash with iran , some foreign-policy experts say there are real consequences for the nation regarding a resolution of its disputed nuclear program .
some western nations , particularly the united states , believe the program is a covert effort to build atomic bombs despite tehran 's denials . " the european union 's stance on iran has evolved to become more skeptical as iran loses more and more credibility , " said tomas valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank . " this situation is n't doing iran any good regarding negotiations , " he said .
" iran is bleeding its goodwill . " unbending after the seven british sailors and eight royal marines were captured in the shatt al arab waterway on march 23 , the british began quiet diplomacy for their release .
but once they pushed it onto the international stage , experts say that iran felt compelled to up the ante . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british say their naval personnel were in iraqi waters this weekend , iranian television showed some of the soldiers confessing to entering iranian territory and apologizing - although it is unclear whether or not those statements were coerced .
earlier on monday , an iranian state-run television station said all 15 british sailors and marines had confessed to illegally entering iranian waters . britain maintains its personnel were in iraqi territory on smuggling patrols under a un mandate .
the maritime border has never been officially recognized , experts say . also , over the weekend , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that there would be further developments regarding its nuclear program soon . some say iran grabbed the soldiers because of its nervousness over an un resolution to force their hand on the nuclear issue .
the security council widened sanctions against iran last week after it defied a second deadline for it to stop enriching uranium , which iran says will only yield electricity " taking the soldiers just before a security council resolution is a clear sign by the iranians to show they can do something , too , " said johannes reissner , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " they want to send a signal that they will not bend , " he said . other motives some observers believe that iranian actions have more to do with seizures of iranians in iraq .
five iranian officials have been held by us forces in iraq since january .
the us says that computers and other equipment seized during the raid provided information on iranian involvement in attacks on us forces in iraq . " it is clearly tit-for-tat , " said valasek .
" the iranians were clearly up to no good in iraq and their people were captured .
iran wants them back and also wants to discourage further incidents as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stood firmyl by the british in this dispute some experts also believe that this is the latest in iran 's strategy to force britain out of iraq , leaving the us without its staunchest ally . " it is clearly an iranian aim to isolate the us , " one eu official told dpa .
" the question now is , where do we go from here ? " harsh pant , an international security expert in the defense studies department at king 's college in london believes that iran is trying to test how far the west is willing to go in stopping its nuclear program and its regional ambitions . " the west has few cards to play because there is n't a unified position on economic sanctions or a threat of military action , " he said .
" so it has few options when diplomacy fails – unless it takes a strong , unified position . " quiet diplomacy but since the recent sharp words between london and tehran , there has been some movement towards a possible way out of the standoff . " things have gone a little quieter and we hope that this is a good sign , " foreign secretary margaret beckett told reporters in bremen .
" what we want is a way out of this , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible . "
on monday , both iran and britain signalled possible ways out of the standoff over the naval personnel .
tehran promised to stop airing video confessions and britain said it was willing to discuss ways to avoid future boundary confusion in the persian gulf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk foreign minister margaret beckett wants the issue resolved quickly while a british official told the ap news service that britain still wants the captives freed unconditionally , iranian state-run radio said the confessions by the naval personnel would not be broadcast because of what it called " positive changes " in britain 's negotiating stance .
the radio did not elaborate on the changes . the eu has also asked chief diplomat javier solana to make contact with the iranians and middle east expert reisser says that quiet diplomacy is the best course of action for the europeans . " freezing diplomatic relations would not be wise , " he said .
" it is important to watch developments closely and use quiet channels to keep things from blowing up .

bayern were thrashed 4-1 in milan at the last 16 stage of last year ’ s champions league .
tuesday ’ s first leg started badly for bayern as andrea pirlo scored his first ever champions league goal to put milan ahead just before half time .
milan looked comfortable but in a sensational end to the game , daniel van buyten equalised for the germans before kaka scored a controversial late penalty to give milan a 2-1 lead .
then in the very last second it was defender van buyten who once again made it two-all .
bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld says his team can never be written off . " bayern munich ’ s stock remains high across europe and the rest of the world and we need to make sure it stays that way .
we can make headlines again in europe and the bundesliga " hitzfeld said .
two away goals put bayern in a commanding position going into the second leg , and the fans , management and players were jubilant at their last-gasp equaliser .
and for one man in particular it was an extra special night .
bayern ’ s regular goalkeeper , oliver kahn was suspended for the match in milan , and his young understudy , michael rensing was making only his second ever champions league appearance .
and rensing rose to the occasion , making a couple of world-class saves .
after the game , rensing was on top of the world .
" the match is being watched all around the world and that ’ s certainly special for me , " he said , adding that even though he 'd played in lots of domestic league and cup games and for the under 21 national side , this game in the champions league was something special .
in the night ’ s other game psv eindhoven and liverpool renewed their acquantaince , after having already played each other in the group stages .
liverpool took the honours then , and that proved the case again on tuesday .
steven gerrad put the reds in front with a fine header in the 27th minute .
and john arne riise doubled the lead with a spectacular long-range effort in the second half .
peter crouch then wrapped things up with towering header towards the end , to secure a convincing 3-0 away win .
unless psv can come up with a miracle next week , the result should be enough to see liverpool go through to the semi-finals .
they ’ ll have a clearer idea of who they ’ ll face in the next round after the remaining quarter-final first legs are played out on wednesday , with roma hosting manchester united , and valencia taking on chelsea . rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic champions league 22.11 dw-radio : newslink feedback send us an e-mail .

participants said they were satisfied with the proposal , after a three hour meeting in berlin . germany a laggard in europe increasing the number of nursery spots would mean that one out of every three german children would have access to a day-care spot , a number von der leyen has pointed out will merely bring germany up to the european average . at present , germany lags behind its european neighbours in providing day care .
figures released by the government show only 13.5 per cent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 per cent . by increasing the number of day care places , germany will reach " european standards , " von der leyen said , stressing that " quick action " was needed because " waiting lists are too long . " government ministers are also hoping that a greater availability of day care places will encourage women to have more children , offsetting a fertility rate of 1.3 children per woman that is one of the lowest in europe . the specifics of how the program will be financed have not been finalized .
von der leyen said there will be federal funding for the childcare plan .
the leaders of the ruling coalition , which is made up of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will discuss the plan later this month . germany 's child-scarce future a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed for reforms von der leyen , a mother of seven herself , recently sparked controversy within the ranks of the cdu with legislation to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities .
the minister wants to ensure that every third child in germany under the age of three will have the chance to attend nursery school . conservatives have criticized the plan as a break with traditional family values .
conservatives feel women should be enouraged to stay at home with their children . when von der leyen first announced her plans earlier this year she saw her popularity rise , but also met with a barrage of criticism from conservative church leaders . the catholic bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , said women were being " degraded into birthing machines , " and called the minister 's idea " blinded by ideology and hostile to children . " besides offering more daycare spots , in january von der leyen also pushed through new legislation that increases the amount of childcare benefits . mothers or fathers now receive two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . yet there 's ongoing concern that german women will continue to choose careers over having children .
a recent study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- shows that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families will have serious long-term repercussions for the economy . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : reformist family minister raises hackles in conservative ranks german family minister ursula von der leyen has ruffled quite a few feathers with her plans for radical changes in family policy aimed at reversing the country 's dismally low birth rate .

along with financial questions , the proposal has stirred up an emotional debate over the roles of women and families in german society .
-lrb- 28.02.2007 -rrb- dw-world : german bishop slammed for calling women " birthing machines " a german bishop has sharply criticized government plans to improve childcare facilities , saying they reduce women to " birthing machines " who quickly have to return to work .

they start doing it in may , so what does he think now ?
steve jobs does not have the halo quite yet at monday 's press event to announce that the itunes music store will be selling " premium " songs from emi 's catalogue without the copy-protection offered by the fairplay digital rights management system , steve jobs noted that " some doubted apple 's sincerity when we made our proposal earlier this year ... they said we had too much to lose " .
that would be me , then .
in february jobs wrote that apple would stop using drm " in an instant " if it could , and i was dismissive .
" i do n't believe him " , i wrote at the time , going on to argue that " if apple switched off fairplay then they would probably sell a lot more songs , on which they make very little money , and a lot fewer ipods , on which they make a lot " .
i also wrote that " jobs can see which way the wind is blowing , and he can see that the record companies are finally tiring of their painful , expensive and ultimately unsatisfactory relationship with drm " , arguing that his comments were an attempt to " position apple for this brave new world " .
' seriously underestimated ' well , he has proved me wrong by opening up the itunes store to non-drm music , and showed that i had seriously underestimated his business acumen .
he may even have done it in a way which avoids the fate of being " crushed under foot by those who really understand the music business and did n't sell their souls to the record companies back in the days when they believed in drm " that i predicted for him in my february column .
i wo n't go so far as to believe that drm-free music market was the endgame when itunes was first launched read the original column on jobs and drm emi takes locks off music it would be easy to be cynical and attempt to dismiss this as just another pr effort from jobs , lining up with a weakened and desperate record company to pull a stunt that will promote emi as it tries to sell itself .
after all emi is only one record company among many , and the london venue for the launch might indicate that the change of heart is at least in part an attempt to defuse eu concerns about interoperability and market distortion in the online music business .
but i 'd rather be positive about what was announced monday .
emi and apple 's action could mark the start of the endgame for music drm , a recognition that it ca n't work and wo n't work , and i approve of this .
in an interoperable world of open music we can leave it to the market to decide which player , which store and which bands make it big , and that is a good thing .
hard-edged i do n't like drm .
i do n't know anyone who has ever downloaded a music track and muttered " how nice to know that this track is copy-protected and so ensures that i do n't inadvertently play it on another computer or copy it to a friend 's music player " .
i 'm pretty sure that steve jobs the man - as opposed to steve jobs the hard-edged ceo of a major technology company - does n't like it either .
everything i 've read and seen of jobs leads me to respect his deal-making ability and to believe that he wants the digital revolution to triumph not falter .
of course he wants apple to be leading the charge - it 's his company - but that does not mean he will make decisions that would damage the long term growth of the networked world .
i wo n't go so far as to believe that drm-free music market was the endgame when itunes was first launched - at least , not until i see the internal e-mails - but it may well have been one of the scenarios that the people behind it considered .
i was also reminded of why jobs matters by a sweet piece of synchronicity , because as he was appearing on stage in london i was helping my girlfriend clear out some of the technology she has been keeping in her attic .
there was a lot of old acorn kit , a z88 , even a mac ii .
but the only shiver came when she handed me a plastic bag containing an apple ii , the computer that changed the world , the computer that steve wozniak built and steve jobs sold .
massive debt if jobs is the man to turn the music industry away from drm then we will all owe him a massive debt of gratitude .
and today , while there is still a lot of manipulation , politicking and arm-twisting to be done , we 've taken a small step in the right direction .
music sites that already offer open music may now be worried that itunes will eat into their market share , but of course the other labels are n't going to change their policy overnight , and in a drm-free world users will be able to buy tracks from different stores and know that they will work on their computer or portable player , just as we can buy cds from any shop and take them home to play .
i might now celebrate by buying a tune or two of unencumbered music from apple 's store when they are available next month , even though it will be more expensive than popping down to my local discount record store and picking up a cd to rip .

" i do n't believe him " , i wrote at the time , going on to argue that " if apple switched off fairplay then they would probably sell a lot more songs , on which they make very little money , and a lot fewer ipods , on which they make a lot " .
i also wrote that " jobs can see which way the wind is blowing , and he can see that the record companies are finally tiring of their painful , expensive and ultimately unsatisfactory relationship with drm " , arguing that his comments were an attempt to " position apple for this brave new world " .
' seriously underestimated ' well , he has proved me wrong by opening up the itunes store to non-drm music , and showed that i had seriously underestimated his business acumen .
he may even have done it in a way which avoids the fate of being " crushed under foot by those who really understand the music business and did n't sell their souls to the record companies back in the days when they believed in drm " that i predicted for him in my february column .
i wo n't go so far as to believe that drm-free music market was the endgame when itunes was first launched read the original column on jobs and drm emi takes locks off music it would be easy to be cynical and attempt to dismiss this as just another pr effort from jobs , lining up with a weakened and desperate record company to pull a stunt that will promote emi as it tries to sell itself .
after all emi is only one record company among many , and the london venue for the launch might indicate that the change of heart is at least in part an attempt to defuse eu concerns about interoperability and market distortion in the online music business .
but i 'd rather be positive about what was announced monday .
emi and apple 's action could mark the start of the endgame for music drm , a recognition that it ca n't work and wo n't work , and i approve of this .
in an interoperable world of open music we can leave it to the market to decide which player , which store and which bands make it big , and that is a good thing .
hard-edged i do n't like drm .
i do n't know anyone who has ever downloaded a music track and muttered " how nice to know that this track is copy-protected and so ensures that i do n't inadvertently play it on another computer or copy it to a friend 's music player " .
i 'm pretty sure that steve jobs the man - as opposed to steve jobs the hard-edged ceo of a major technology company - does n't like it either .
everything i 've read and seen of jobs leads me to respect his deal-making ability and to believe that he wants the digital revolution to triumph not falter .
of course he wants apple to be leading the charge - it 's his company - but that does not mean he will make decisions that would damage the long term growth of the networked world .
i wo n't go so far as to believe that drm-free music market was the endgame when itunes was first launched - at least , not until i see the internal e-mails - but it may well have been one of the scenarios that the people behind it considered .
i was also reminded of why jobs matters by a sweet piece of synchronicity , because as he was appearing on stage in london i was helping my girlfriend clear out some of the technology she has been keeping in her attic .
there was a lot of old acorn kit , a z88 , even a mac ii .
but the only shiver came when she handed me a plastic bag containing an apple ii , the computer that changed the world , the computer that steve wozniak built and steve jobs sold .
massive debt if jobs is the man to turn the music industry away from drm then we will all owe him a massive debt of gratitude .
and today , while there is still a lot of manipulation , politicking and arm-twisting to be done , we 've taken a small step in the right direction .
music sites that already offer open music may now be worried that itunes will eat into their market share , but of course the other labels are n't going to change their policy overnight , and in a drm-free world users will be able to buy tracks from different stores and know that they will work on their computer or portable player , just as we can buy cds from any shop and take them home to play .
i might now celebrate by buying a tune or two of unencumbered music from apple 's store when they are available next month , even though it will be more expensive than popping down to my local discount record store and picking up a cd to rip .

they start doing it in may , so what does he think now ?
steve jobs does not have the halo quite yet at monday 's press event to announce that the itunes music store will be selling " premium " songs from emi 's catalogue without the copy-protection offered by the fairplay digital rights management system , steve jobs noted that " some doubted apple 's sincerity when we made our proposal earlier this year ... they said we had too much to lose " .
that would be me , then .
in february jobs wrote that apple would stop using drm " in an instant " if it could , and i was dismissive .
" i do n't believe him " , i wrote at the time , going on to argue that " if apple switched off fairplay then they would probably sell a lot more songs , on which they make very little money , and a lot fewer ipods , on which they make a lot " .
i also wrote that " jobs can see which way the wind is blowing , and he can see that the record companies are finally tiring of their painful , expensive and ultimately unsatisfactory relationship with drm " , arguing that his comments were an attempt to " position apple for this brave new world " .
' seriously underestimated ' well , he has proved me wrong by opening up the itunes store to non-drm music , and showed that i had seriously underestimated his business acumen .
he may even have done it in a way which avoids the fate of being " crushed under foot by those who really understand the music business and did n't sell their souls to the record companies back in the days when they believed in drm " that i predicted for him in my february column .
i wo n't go so far as to believe that drm-free music market was the endgame when itunes was first launched read the original column on jobs and drm emi takes locks off music it would be easy to be cynical and attempt to dismiss this as just another pr effort from jobs , lining up with a weakened and desperate record company to pull a stunt that will promote emi as it tries to sell itself .
after all emi is only one record company among many , and the london venue for the launch might indicate that the change of heart is at least in part an attempt to defuse eu concerns about interoperability and market distortion in the online music business .
but i 'd rather be positive about what was announced monday .
emi and apple 's action could mark the start of the endgame for music drm , a recognition that it ca n't work and wo n't work , and i approve of this .
in an interoperable world of open music we can leave it to the market to decide which player , which store and which bands make it big , and that is a good thing .
hard-edged i do n't like drm .
i do n't know anyone who has ever downloaded a music track and muttered " how nice to know that this track is copy-protected and so ensures that i do n't inadvertently play it on another computer or copy it to a friend 's music player " .
i 'm pretty sure that steve jobs the man - as opposed to steve jobs the hard-edged ceo of a major technology company - does n't like it either .
everything i 've read and seen of jobs leads me to respect his deal-making ability and to believe that he wants the digital revolution to triumph not falter .
of course he wants apple to be leading the charge - it 's his company - but that does not mean he will make decisions that would damage the long term growth of the networked world .
i wo n't go so far as to believe that drm-free music market was the endgame when itunes was first launched - at least , not until i see the internal e-mails - but it may well have been one of the scenarios that the people behind it considered .
i was also reminded of why jobs matters by a sweet piece of synchronicity , because as he was appearing on stage in london i was helping my girlfriend clear out some of the technology she has been keeping in her attic .
there was a lot of old acorn kit , a z88 , even a mac ii .
but the only shiver came when she handed me a plastic bag containing an apple ii , the computer that changed the world , the computer that steve wozniak built and steve jobs sold .
massive debt if jobs is the man to turn the music industry away from drm then we will all owe him a massive debt of gratitude .
and today , while there is still a lot of manipulation , politicking and arm-twisting to be done , we 've taken a small step in the right direction .
music sites that already offer open music may now be worried that itunes will eat into their market share , but of course the other labels are n't going to change their policy overnight , and in a drm-free world users will be able to buy tracks from different stores and know that they will work on their computer or portable player , just as we can buy cds from any shop and take them home to play .
i might now celebrate by buying a tune or two of unencumbered music from apple 's store when they are available next month , even though it will be more expensive than popping down to my local discount record store and picking up a cd to rip .

researchers examined the health impact of the meltdown of the chernobyl nuclear power plant , and the atomic bombs dropped on japan in 1945 .
they concluded the risks were probably no greater than those posed by obesity , smoking and urban pollution .
however , a radiation expert cast doubt on the bmc public health research . "
i 'm not sure that it helps to compare the health risks from radiation among survivors of the atomic bombings in japan with the risks from obesity or smoking " dr michael clark , health protection agency he said the risks posed by radiation were not comparable to those from other sources .
researcher dr jim smith , from the centre for ecology and hydrology , said exposure to radiation took fewer years off life expectancy than heavy smoking or severely obese .
he calculated that someone who was exposed to radiation after the chernobyl incident had around a one in 100 chance of contracting a fatal cancer in later life as a direct result - in effect the mortality risk was increased by 1 % .
dr smith estimated that exposure to air pollution , or passive smoking had a similar impact .
he conceded that the exact risk linked to pollution or passive smoking was harder to pin down .
but he said people living unofficially within the chernobyl exclusion zone may have a lower health risk than if they were being exposed to the air pollution in a large nearby city such as kiev .
dr smith said : " the perception is that there are big risks to public health from radiation exposure .
" this study shows that for the population exposed to significant doses of radiation from the chernobyl incident , the risks of premature death are no greater than those of being subjected to prolonged passive smoking or of constantly over-eating .
" we can all face such health risks just going about our daily lives . "
fears and perceptions he said people 's fears or perceptions of the health risks they were exposed to after chernobyl could prompt people to behave in ways which would actually have more impact on their health - such as becoming a heavy smoker .
but dr michael clark , a radiation expert at the health protection agency , said : " comparing risks can give a helpful perspective but it needs to be done with care .
" comparing the radiation risks of living near chernobyl with the risk from air pollution in nearby kiev may be relevant .
" however i 'm not sure that it helps to compare the health risks from radiation among survivors of the atomic bombings in japan with the risks from obesity or smoking .
" one is an extreme involuntary risk , the others are self imposed . "
a un report estimated around 9,000 people exposed to radiation in the chernobyl incident in 1986 would die from cancer , although greenpeace has said the number of deaths linked to the incident could be closer to 90,000 .
the atomic bomb dropped on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki are estimated to have killed a combined total of more than 200,000 people .

researchers examined the health impact of the meltdown of the chernobyl nuclear power plant , and the atomic bombs dropped on japan in 1945 .
they concluded the risks were probably no greater than those posed by obesity , smoking and urban pollution .
however , a radiation expert cast doubt on the bmc public health research .
i 'm not sure that it helps to compare the health risks from radiation among survivors of the atomic bombings in japan with the risks from obesity or smoking dr michael clark , health protection agency he said the risks posed by radiation were not comparable to those from other sources .
researcher dr jim smith , from the centre for ecology and hydrology , said exposure to radiation took fewer years off life expectancy than heavy smoking or severely obese .
he calculated that someone who was exposed to radiation after the chernobyl incident had around a one in 100 chance of contracting a fatal cancer in later life as a direct result - in effect the mortality risk was increased by 1 % .
dr smith estimated that exposure to air pollution , or passive smoking had a similar impact .
he conceded that the exact risk linked to pollution or passive smoking was harder to pin down .
but he said people living unofficially within the chernobyl exclusion zone may have a lower health risk than if they were being exposed to the air pollution in a large nearby city such as kiev .
dr smith said : " the perception is that there are big risks to public health from radiation exposure .
" this study shows that for the population exposed to significant doses of radiation from the chernobyl incident , the risks of premature death are no greater than those of being subjected to prolonged passive smoking or of constantly over-eating .
" we can all face such health risks just going about our daily lives . "
fears and perceptions he said people 's fears or perceptions of the health risks they were exposed to after chernobyl could prompt people to behave in ways which would actually have more impact on their health - such as becoming a heavy smoker .
but dr michael clark , a radiation expert at the health protection agency , said : " comparing risks can give a helpful perspective but it needs to be done with care .
" comparing the radiation risks of living near chernobyl with the risk from air pollution in nearby kiev may be relevant .
" however i 'm not sure that it helps to compare the health risks from radiation among survivors of the atomic bombings in japan with the risks from obesity or smoking .
" one is an extreme involuntary risk , the others are self imposed . "
a un report estimated around 9,000 people exposed to radiation in the chernobyl incident in 1986 would die from cancer , although greenpeace has said the number of deaths linked to the incident could be closer to 90,000 .

she unveiled a plaque commemorating the occasion before attending a special tea dance at the council house .

some guests invited to the tea party attended a previous opening of the square by the prince of wales - later to become king edward viii - in 1929 .
vet school the princess will be invited to plant the final flowers in new flowerbeds at the square .
the redevelopment of the old market square has included the removal of walls and steps and other aspects of the 1929 design , which were replaced by granite flagstones , seating terraces , flowerbeds , trees and a water terrace .
engineers have already had to be called in to deal with a problem with the square 's water feature after pressure built up behind bricks , causing the stonework to expand .
the city has also had to remove graffiti from wooden rails surrounding part of the new public space .

isdn proved very popular with people working from home who needed access to data connections faster than available dial-up modem speeds .
" we are withdrawing consumer isdn , " said a bt spokesman , " the demand for it has dived with the availability of cheap , fast broadband . "
but some broadcasters feel the service is still essential to their jobs .
back when home net users relied on dial-up modems and fast data pipes were so expensive that only businesses had them , isdn emerged as a hugely attractive alternative .
speed demon the all-digital end-to-end connection could run at 64 kilobits per second -lrb- kbps -rrb- , both upstream and downstream , and was charged by how long you used it for - just like a fixed phone .
many home users signed up for bt 's domestic isdn service , which was known as home highway , to get at those heady browsing speeds .
also many businesses used it as a back-up for their fixed fast data lines .
but as fast data pipes , broadband to you and me , became more popular isdn has lost its lustre for those home users .
according to figures from watchdog ofcom the average speed enjoyed by the 50 % of uk adults with broadband is 3.8mbps - far faster than home highway isdn can manage .
technology change but there is one group for whom isdn has not lost its attractions - broadcasters .
although slow by broadband speeds , isdn is proving useful for them it has proved to be a boon when filing reports away from base .
unfortunately the technology is being discontinued all over the world leaving many broadcasters with a problem of what to replace it with .
" there 's nothing that can replace it , " said gavin davis , head of glen sound which makes isdn equipment for the broadcast industry .
one of isdn 's advantages , he said , was that it gave the same speed connection upstream and down .
but because of the technology used to get broadband into homes this has disappeared .
as its name implies asymmetric digital subscriber line -lrb- adsl -rrb- used for domestic broadband lets people download much faster than they can upload added to this are some basic problems with the way that ip-based networks , ie the internet , handle data traffic jams .
" for outside broadcast-type work ip just does not work , " said mr davis .
the problem , he said , was that data sent across the net is all mixed together .
there are no guarantees that packets of data will arrive at all or that they will take the same amount of time to arrive at their destination .
" isdn is extremely useful to us because , unlike ip , it does n't use contention - the bit rate on the tin is the bit rate you get , " said rupert brun , head of technology and projects in bbc radio production .
" compare this with ip where the connection gets slower as the network gets busier , " he said .
adding delay to data streams can cause problems for live shows to cope with busy times some ip-based broadcast equipment inserts delay , or latency , in a bid to help the data stream get through .
but , said mr brun , this causes more problems .
" latency becomes a real issue for live broadcasts where we need to send output back to a journalist or presenter , " said mr brun , " if the feed back to their headphones is delayed too much it can be very difficult for them to speak . "
it can also stymie scheduling plans in which live broadcasts are supposed to dovetail with planned programming .
mr brun said the bbc was trialling ip-based alternatives with local radio shows .
" developments in ip allow guaranteed levels of service to be established , " he said , " but it then costs more . "
bt pointed out that although isdn will not be offered to consumers , it was still available to businesses - both large and small .
mr davis from glen sound said the european broadcasting union was starting to draw up standards to ensure ip-based broadcasting equipment is a good replacement .
some nations such as sweden , he said , have gone as far as pushing manufacturers to build hardware just for them .
but , he said , the alternatives will take time to arrive .
" it 's reasonable to expect that in a few years time the telecoms firms will be able to provide short-term , high-quality , bi-directional ip circuits , " said mr davis .
" they certainly can not do it now . "

isdn proved very popular with people working from home who needed access to data connections faster than available dial-up modem speeds .
" we are withdrawing consumer isdn , " said a bt spokesman , " the demand for it has dived with the availability of cheap , fast broadband . "
but some broadcasters feel the service is still essential to their jobs .
back when home net users relied on dial-up modems and fast data pipes were so expensive that only businesses had them , isdn emerged as a hugely attractive alternative .
speed demon the all-digital end-to-end connection could run at 64 kilobits per second -lrb- kbps -rrb- , both upstream and downstream , and was charged by how long you used it for - just like a fixed phone .
many home users signed up for bt 's domestic isdn service , which was known as home highway , to get at those heady browsing speeds .
also many businesses used it as a back-up for their fixed fast data lines .
but as fast data pipes , broadband to you and me , became more popular isdn has lost its lustre for those home users .
according to figures from watchdog ofcom the average speed enjoyed by the 50 % of uk adults with broadband is 3.8mbps - far faster than home highway isdn can manage .
technology change but there is one group for whom isdn has not lost its attractions - broadcasters .
although slow by broadband speeds , isdn is proving useful for them it has proved to be a boon when filing reports away from base .
unfortunately the technology is being discontinued all over the world leaving many broadcasters with a problem of what to replace it with .
" there 's nothing that can replace it , " said gavin davis , head of glen sound which makes isdn equipment for the broadcast industry .
one of isdn 's advantages , he said , was that it gave the same speed connection upstream and down .
but because of the technology used to get broadband into homes this has disappeared .
as its name implies asymmetric digital subscriber line -lrb- adsl -rrb- used for domestic broadband lets people download much faster than they can upload added to this are some basic problems with the way that ip-based networks , ie the internet , handle data traffic jams .

reporting its 2006 results , its pre-tax profit dropped to £ 5.2m from £ 20.1m in 2005 , when the most recent book about the teenage wizard was released .
the results were not a surprise as bloomsbury warned in december that its full-year profits would be down .
the seventh and final harry potter book is set for release in july this year .
' growth strategy ' bloomsbury chairman nigel newton said 2006 was " a challenging year " .
its turnover for the year fell 32 % to £ 74.8m from £ 109.1m in 2005 .
mr newton said the firm now had a growth strategy in place that included developing new authors , internet-based initiatives , and acquisitions , " all of which we believe will enhance and strengthen our position as a leading publisher " .
the global success of the harry potter books has generated bumper profits for bloomsbury , but the company is now under pressure to find new hit publications as the potter series draws to a close .
in previous years without a new harry potter release , the company has been able to continue to raise profits , thanks mainly to follow-up paperback sales or the books ' global roll-out .
however , it now appears that these have both reached saturation point and that anyone who wants a current harry potter book has already got one .

reporting its 2006 results , its pre-tax profit dropped to £ 5.2m from £ 20.1m in 2005 , when the most recent book about the teenage wizard was released .
the results were not a surprise as bloomsbury warned in december that its full-year profits would be down .
the seventh and final harry potter book is set for release in july this year .
' growth strategy ' bloomsbury chairman nigel newton said 2006 was " a challenging year " .
its turnover for the year fell 32 % to £ 74.8m from £ 109.1m in 2005 .
mr newton said the firm now had a growth strategy in place that included developing new authors , internet-based initiatives , and acquisitions , " all of which we believe will enhance and strengthen our position as a leading publisher " .
the global success of the harry potter books has generated bumper profits for bloomsbury , but the company is now under pressure to find new hit publications as the potter series draws to a close .
in previous years without a new harry potter release , the company has been able to continue to raise profits , thanks mainly to follow-up paperback sales or the books ' global roll-out .
however , it now appears that these have both reached saturation point and that anyone who wants a current harry potter book has already got one .

mr garcia said drug barons must also be pursued and warned that peru could face an insurgency funded by illicit drugs .
peru must kill the drug-trafficking trade or have to deal with an insurgency like that of neighbouring colombia , mr garcia said .
peru is the second-largest producer of cocaine in the world after colombia .

it comes after it warned last year that it needed to cut jobs to rein in costs .
the utility group said both full-time and agency jobs would go over the next five years , and that further details would be announced in june .
severn trent also said its profits for its financial year to 31 march should rise between 1 % and 3 % .
based in birmingham , severn trent supplies water and treats sewage for about eight million people in the midlands and certain regions of wales .
it said in december that it needed to rein in costs as money spent fixing pipe leaks and higher energy prices had hit first-half profits .
' appalling ' the amicus union attacked the way in which severn trent chose to announce the job cuts .
" the action of issuing a general statement over the company 's intranet site announcing these job cuts is an unacceptable and appalling way to deal with its employees at such a time , " said amicus national officer dougie rooney .

it comes after it warned last year that it needed to cut jobs to rein in costs .
the utility group said both full-time and agency jobs would go over the next five years , and that further details would be announced in june .
severn trent also said its profits for its financial year to 31 march should rise between 1 % and 3 % .
based in birmingham , severn trent supplies water and treats sewage for about eight million people in the midlands and certain regions of wales .
it said in december that it needed to rein in costs as money spent fixing pipe leaks and higher energy prices had hit first-half profits .
' appalling ' the amicus union attacked the way in which severn trent chose to announce the job cuts .
" the action of issuing a general statement over the company 's intranet site announcing these job cuts is an unacceptable and appalling way to deal with its employees at such a time , " said amicus national officer dougie rooney .
" our representatives have not been informed and we are demanding that the company enter into proper consultations .
" otherwise amicus is prepared to consider industrial action . "
