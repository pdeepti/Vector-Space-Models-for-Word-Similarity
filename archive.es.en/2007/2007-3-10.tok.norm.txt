program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2007 despite planned ban , german mps fight for right to light up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german mps want to continue to have the right to do this in their offices the german government last month agreed to ban smoking in public transport and federal buildings .
but its own backyard seems to be an exception with some parliamentarians reluctant to stub out . alarmed by figures by the german cancer research centre which say that about 3,300 germans die of passive smoking annually , the government recently agreed on wide-reaching legislation that would outlaw smoking in public transport and other public buildings .
offenders could be fined up to 1,000 euros . but that ban does not extend to the german parliament .
the government is not entitled to influence the smoking behavior of the 614 mps in the national parliament building , the reichstag where images of the pipe-smoking social democrat parliamentary speaker , peter struck are a familiar sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck with his characteristic pipe and struck is by no means alone in fighting for moderate regulations in the german parliament which would continue to allow hardened smokers to puff away in the reichstag ’ s hallways and restaurants . many say if that ’ s no longer possible , they should be able to continue to smoke at least in their own offices . irresponsible behavior ? opposition green party mp birgit bender is appalled at what she describes as the irresponsible behavior of a few to the detriment of the majority of parliamentarians . “ you can ’ t really explain to people out in the country why they can still see mps puffing away happily in parliament , while at the same time the government has announced harsh measures to ban smoking at the workplace completely , " bender said .
" and there ’ s no reason to think that visitors to the bundestag and fellow parliamentarians should not be protected from the hazards of passive smoking .
i can only say that the omnipresent wafts of smoke in the hallways of the parliamentary building are increasingly getting on my nerves and respiratory tract and i ’ m no longer willing to endure them . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german mps do n't want the bundestag turning smoke-free in fact , most german mps seem to realize that any regulations on smoking in the bundestag or lower house of parliament which are laxer than those to be imposed on the rest of the country could send out a disastrous signal . that does n't mean that a few die-hard smokers across all mainstream parties have given up the fight for their perceived right to harm others . " a more level-headed approach " among them is opposition liberal democrat health affairs spokesman , detlef parr .
reacting to birgit bender ’ s call for a completely smoke-free bundestag , pfarr said a mountain was being made out a molehill . “ are the greens high on drugs or why are they constantly seeing crowds of suffering non-smokers whom i just can ’ t detect anywhere in this building ? "
pfarr said .
" the legislation as proposed by the cabinet is not yet in the bag , but the greens want to be two steps ahead yet again and foist regulations on us even before the house has debated the bill .
it only goes to show that the greens like nothing better than bans whenever they ’ re unable to come to terms with an issue , " he said .
" we liberal democrats think that a more level-headed approach would stand us parliamentarians in good stead . ” eventually , the matter will have to be decided by the bundestag ’ s council of elders .
it ’ s already indicated that there must be no special exceptions for smokers among parliamentarians . and the council is also in favor of imposing heavy fines for offenders .
the police , however , would have no way of enforcing these in the reichstag building .
their authority ends at the doors of the parliament building . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves smoking ban smokers in germany will be limited in exercising their addiction beginning in september .

" " we have warned them .
otherwise , you will not even see one corpse for these two agents , " said one of three masked gunmen who appeared to be standing behind the purported hostages . " those people are n't joking " the footage showed hannelore marianne krause , 61 urging the german government to help her .
it also showed krause 's passport .
krause wearing a blue headscarf was shown crying along with her dark-haired bearded son who sat on the floor next to her while she made a lengthy appeal in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the hostages has made a direct appeal to german chancellor merkel a written arabic translation of her statement said that she was calling on german chancellor angela merkel to save her life and that of her son by pulling out troops from afghanistan . " i have been held captive for a long time .
i beg you to help me .
i was very happy when you became chancellor but unfortunately until now you did not help me , " the translation said . " i am under threat .
these people want to kill my son in front of me and then kill me if german troops do not withdraw from afghanistan , " the translation said .
" please implement my demands .
those people are not joking . " she also asked german organizations to apply pressure on berlin to meet the kidnappers ' demands . in berlin , the german foreign ministry said a crisis team was studying the situation . germany a vocal opponent of the iraq war foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier confirmed on february 12 that two german citizens had been missing in iraq for a week and might have been abducted . the berlin daily tagesspiegel , citing security sources , reported at the time that the victims were a woman in her 60s , who is married to a iraqi doctor , and their son who is in his 20s . it is the third abduction of germans in iraq since the us-led war was launched in 2003 . according to the german foreign ministry there are still about a hundred german nationals in iraq , people working for german and international companies or diplomatic services .
germany has issued a security warning on travel to iraq due to the unstable security environment there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke were kidnapped in iraq last year about a year ago , two german technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke were released by their kidnappers after a three-month hostage ordeal .
and in november 2005 susanne osthoff , a german archeologist working for an aid organization , was released after the german government was reported to have paid a ransom to the tune of several million euros .
berlin however denies it . germany vehemently opposed the us-led war in iraq , but it does have 3,000 troops in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , where it commands the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aid worker killed in afghanistan ambush unknown gunmen shot dead a german aid worker in northern afghanistan thursday after letting three afghans he was travelling with go free , afghan officials said .

but its own backyard seems to be an exception with some parliamentarians reluctant to stub out . alarmed by figures by the german cancer research centre which say that about 3,300 germans die of passive smoking annually , the government recently agreed on wide-reaching legislation that would outlaw smoking in public transport and other public buildings .

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "
while it is important for young children to have a stable environment , they also need time for themselves , " he said .
the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .
" von der leyen 's family policies are not meant to benefit children 's well-being or strengthen family values but rather are mainly designed to recruit young women into industry , " he said .
the bishop said her policies are aimed at turning young women into " birthing machines . " reality bites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to encourage women to have kids despite the rumblings in conservative quarters , many believe that the gravity of germany 's demographic problems will eventually melt down the resistance to von der leyen 's plans . angela merkel has thrown her weight behind von der leyen 's proposals and even the catholic church has backed her . referring to the criticism of von der leyen from some cdu members , joachim meyer , president of the central committee of german catholics said : " with that kind of politics germany does its families no justice , and dramatically endangers its own future . " " apparently , those in the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union have prevailed who still refuse to accept the reality of young families , " meyer added . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de value of women at heart of childcare debate should germany triple the number of early child-care spots ?
along with financial questions , the proposal has stirred up an emotional debate over the roles of women and families in german society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 10.03.2007 despite planned ban , german mps fight for right to light up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german mps want to continue to have the right to do this in their offices the german government last month agreed to ban smoking in public transport and federal buildings .
but its own backyard seems to be an exception with some parliamentarians reluctant to stub out . alarmed by figures by the german cancer research centre which say that about 3,300 germans die of passive smoking annually , the government recently agreed on wide-reaching legislation that would outlaw smoking in public transport and other public buildings .
offenders could be fined up to 1,000 euros . but that ban does not extend to the german parliament .
the government is not entitled to influence the smoking behavior of the 614 mps in the national parliament building , the reichstag where images of the pipe-smoking social democrat parliamentary speaker , peter struck are a familiar sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck with his characteristic pipe and struck is by no means alone in fighting for moderate regulations in the german parliament which would continue to allow hardened smokers to puff away in the reichstag ’ s hallways and restaurants . many say if that ’ s no longer possible , they should be able to continue to smoke at least in their own offices . irresponsible behavior ? opposition green party mp birgit bender is appalled at what she describes as the irresponsible behavior of a few to the detriment of the majority of parliamentarians . “ you can ’ t really explain to people out in the country why they can still see mps puffing away happily in parliament , while at the same time the government has announced harsh measures to ban smoking at the workplace completely , " bender said .
" and there ’ s no reason to think that visitors to the bundestag and fellow parliamentarians should not be protected from the hazards of passive smoking .
i can only say that the omnipresent wafts of smoke in the hallways of the parliamentary building are increasingly getting on my nerves and respiratory tract and i ’ m no longer willing to endure them . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german mps do n't want the bundestag turning smoke-free in fact , most german mps seem to realize that any regulations on smoking in the bundestag or lower house of parliament which are laxer than those to be imposed on the rest of the country could send out a disastrous signal . that does n't mean that a few die-hard smokers across all mainstream parties have given up the fight for their perceived right to harm others . " a more level-headed approach " among them is opposition liberal democrat health affairs spokesman , detlef parr .
reacting to birgit bender ’ s call for a completely smoke-free bundestag , pfarr said a mountain was being made out a molehill . “ are the greens high on drugs or why are they constantly seeing crowds of suffering non-smokers whom i just can ’ t detect anywhere in this building ? "
pfarr said .
" the legislation as proposed by the cabinet is not yet in the bag , but the greens want to be two steps ahead yet again and foist regulations on us even before the house has debated the bill .
it only goes to show that the greens like nothing better than bans whenever they ’ re unable to come to terms with an issue , " he said .
" we liberal democrats think that a more level-headed approach would stand us parliamentarians in good stead . ” eventually , the matter will have to be decided by the bundestag ’ s council of elders .
it ’ s already indicated that there must be no special exceptions for smokers among parliamentarians . and the council is also in favor of imposing heavy fines for offenders .
the police , however , would have no way of enforcing these in the reichstag building .
their authority ends at the doors of the parliament building . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves smoking ban smokers in germany will be limited in exercising their addiction beginning in september .

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "
while it is important for young children to have a stable environment , they also need time for themselves , " he said .
the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .
" von der leyen 's family policies are not meant to benefit children 's well-being or strengthen family values but rather are mainly designed to recruit young women into industry , " he said .
the bishop said her policies are aimed at turning young women into " birthing machines . " reality bites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to encourage women to have kids despite the rumblings in conservative quarters , many believe that the gravity of germany 's demographic problems will eventually melt down the resistance to von der leyen 's plans . angela merkel has thrown her weight behind von der leyen 's proposals and even the catholic church has backed her . referring to the criticism of von der leyen from some cdu members , joachim meyer , president of the central committee of german catholics said : " with that kind of politics germany does its families no justice , and dramatically endangers its own future . " " apparently , those in the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union have prevailed who still refuse to accept the reality of young families , " meyer added . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de value of women at heart of childcare debate should germany triple the number of early child-care spots ?

the average dachshund currently costs between 500 and 600 euros -lrb- $ 655 and $ 786 -rrb- . honsalek added that it was a dachshund 's independence , and sometimes even stubbornness , that convinced him to have 15 of the dogs , careful to point out that not all dachshunds are the same . competition from abroad heavier dachshunds that can barely keep their stomachs from brushing the ground are members of an american breed and unlike slimmer german dogs that , at nine kilograms -lrb- 19.8 pounds -rrb- , weigh in a good five kilos less than their american cousins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the prince of denmark see you in there !
in addition to the american breed , the traditional german symbol is also facing competition from denmark , where prince henrik , president of the country 's dachshund society , dedicated a poem to royal sausage dog evita : " i love to pet your fur / and see it fall smooth / you dear , you special dog . " despite his professed love of the dachshund , which he said he would like to be if ever reincarnated , the dogs may still wish to keep out of copenhagen for the time being .
the prince also announced in may that he loved the taste of dog meat , likening it to slightly dry veal and adding that it tasted best when sauteed or grilled and cut into thin slices . birgit bütter of the german dog association , however , said the german dachshund is getting on just fine .

" every victory is good for the confidence , especially if it comes against real , " goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn told thursday 's edition of kicker sports magazine .

" perennial runners up ? schalke hope to end their misery at mid-table hanover 96 , but the loss of brazilian forward lincoln , who will be serving the second match in a five-game ban , and defender dario rodriguez , who will be out after picking up a fifth yellow card , will make the endeavor a challenge . in third place by a four-point margin , stuttgart look to have the least pressure on them this weekend playing at home against wolfsburg , who are only two points away from the relegation zone . despite being kicked out of the top spot by bayern a number of times in recent years , neither schalke nor stuttgart are willing to admit to a gnawing feeling in the back of their minds that the bavarians could be approaching . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn said bayern still has plenty of time to draw and quarter the competition schalke coach mirko slomka shrugged off munich 's comeback , saying , " we are not looking at teams behind us .

" every victory is good for the confidence , especially if it comes against real , " goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn told thursday 's edition of kicker sports magazine .
" this has further strengthened my belief that a lot is possible this season . " munich coach ottmar hitzfeld said he also believes bayern can defend the german league title they won last season , but emphasized that there is still plenty to be decided . bundesliga work remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld has managed bayern into the champions league quarterfinals on wednesday " we have made it to the quarterfinals but in the bundesliga we are not in the champions league places , " he said .
" it 's still a critical situation and we have n't achieved anything yet .
we have come back into contention in the bundesliga and in europe .
now we need to concentrate on the bremen match . " bremen 's confidence is also on the rise after a victory last week over bochum . " our crisis is over , " said defender clemens fritz .
" we can achieve both , advancing into the uefa cup final and winning the bundesliga . " perennial runners up ? schalke hope to end their misery at mid-table hanover 96 , but the loss of brazilian forward lincoln , who will be serving the second match in a five-game ban , and defender dario rodriguez , who will be out after picking up a fifth yellow card , will make the endeavor a challenge . in third place by a four-point margin , stuttgart look to have the least pressure on them this weekend playing at home against wolfsburg , who are only two points away from the relegation zone . despite being kicked out of the top spot by bayern a number of times in recent years , neither schalke nor stuttgart are willing to admit to a gnawing feeling in the back of their minds that the bavarians could be approaching . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn said bayern still has plenty of time to draw and quarter the competition schalke coach mirko slomka shrugged off munich 's comeback , saying , " we are not looking at teams behind us . "
his stuttgart counterpart armin veh agreed , " we are not looking at bayern . " kahn : forget us at your peril but munich keeper kahn said he thinks they should be . " there are 10 games left and we have a six-point deficit , " the keeper said .
" there would be something very wrong if we did n't believe in our chance .
you always have to watch out for us , until the very last second of the season . " elsewhere , improving sv hamburg run into bayer leverkusen in the other sunday game .
hamburg have won their last four games , including success in bremen and schalke .
leverkusen have two wins in a row , at schalke and against stuttgart . the other weekend games are nuremberg vs. eintracht frankfurt , borussia mönchengladbach vs. hertha berlin , vfl bochum vs. borussia dortmund , mainz 05 vs. arminia bielefeld and energie cottbus vs. alemannia aachen . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitzfeld works the old champions league magic bayern munich 's veteran coach ottmar hitzfeld could barely disguise his excitement after the club he returned to a month ago reached the champions league quarterfinals at real madrid 's expense .

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "
while it is important for young children to have a stable environment , they also need time for themselves , " he said .
the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .
" von der leyen 's family policies are not meant to benefit children 's well-being or strengthen family values but rather are mainly designed to recruit young women into industry , " he said .
the bishop said her policies are aimed at turning young women into " birthing machines . " reality bites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to encourage women to have kids despite the rumblings in conservative quarters , many believe that the gravity of germany 's demographic problems will eventually melt down the resistance to von der leyen 's plans . angela merkel has thrown her weight behind von der leyen 's proposals and even the catholic church has backed her . referring to the criticism of von der leyen from some cdu members , joachim meyer , president of the central committee of german catholics said : " with that kind of politics germany does its families no justice , and dramatically endangers its own future . " " apparently , those in the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union have prevailed who still refuse to accept the reality of young families , " meyer added . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de value of women at heart of childcare debate should germany triple the number of early child-care spots ?

the average dachshund currently costs between 500 and 600 euros -lrb- $ 655 and $ 786 -rrb- . honsalek added that it was a dachshund 's independence , and sometimes even stubbornness , that convinced him to have 15 of the dogs , careful to point out that not all dachshunds are the same . competition from abroad heavier dachshunds that can barely keep their stomachs from brushing the ground are members of an american breed and unlike slimmer german dogs that , at nine kilograms -lrb- 19.8 pounds -rrb- , weigh in a good five kilos less than their american cousins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the prince of denmark see you in there !

the prince also announced in may that he loved the taste of dog meat , likening it to slightly dry veal and adding that it tasted best when sauteed or grilled and cut into thin slices . birgit bütter of the german dog association , however , said the german dachshund is getting on just fine .

the average dachshund currently costs between 500 and 600 euros -lrb- $ 655 and $ 786 -rrb- . honsalek added that it was a dachshund 's independence , and sometimes even stubbornness , that convinced him to have 15 of the dogs , careful to point out that not all dachshunds are the same . competition from abroad heavier dachshunds that can barely keep their stomachs from brushing the ground are members of an american breed and unlike slimmer german dogs that , at nine kilograms -lrb- 19.8 pounds -rrb- , weigh in a good five kilos less than their american cousins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the prince of denmark see you in there !
in addition to the american breed , the traditional german symbol is also facing competition from denmark , where prince henrik , president of the country 's dachshund society , dedicated a poem to royal sausage dog evita : " i love to pet your fur / and see it fall smooth / you dear , you special dog . " despite his professed love of the dachshund , which he said he would like to be if ever reincarnated , the dogs may still wish to keep out of copenhagen for the time being .
the prince also announced in may that he loved the taste of dog meat , likening it to slightly dry veal and adding that it tasted best when sauteed or grilled and cut into thin slices . birgit bütter of the german dog association , however , said the german dachshund is getting on just fine . " no one needs to worry about the breed , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eagle killing could prove pricey for german dachshund owner in a bizarre case featuring two national symbols , judges are expect to rule in favor of the cipher of german statehood , the eagle , and against the man on the street with his sausage dog .

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "
while it is important for young children to have a stable environment , they also need time for themselves , " he said .
the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .
" von der leyen 's family policies are not meant to benefit children 's well-being or strengthen family values but rather are mainly designed to recruit young women into industry , " he said .
the bishop said her policies are aimed at turning young women into " birthing machines . " reality bites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to encourage women to have kids despite the rumblings in conservative quarters , many believe that the gravity of germany 's demographic problems will eventually melt down the resistance to von der leyen 's plans . angela merkel has thrown her weight behind von der leyen 's proposals and even the catholic church has backed her . referring to the criticism of von der leyen from some cdu members , joachim meyer , president of the central committee of german catholics said : " with that kind of politics germany does its families no justice , and dramatically endangers its own future . " " apparently , those in the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union have prevailed who still refuse to accept the reality of young families , " meyer added . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de value of women at heart of childcare debate should germany triple the number of early child-care spots ?
along with financial questions , the proposal has stirred up an emotional debate over the roles of women and families in german society .

" that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers .

this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "

the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2007 despite planned ban , german mps fight for right to light up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german mps want to continue to have the right to do this in their offices the german government last month agreed to ban smoking in public transport and federal buildings .
but its own backyard seems to be an exception with some parliamentarians reluctant to stub out . alarmed by figures by the german cancer research centre which say that about 3,300 germans die of passive smoking annually , the government recently agreed on wide-reaching legislation that would outlaw smoking in public transport and other public buildings .
offenders could be fined up to 1,000 euros . but that ban does not extend to the german parliament .
the government is not entitled to influence the smoking behavior of the 614 mps in the national parliament building , the reichstag where images of the pipe-smoking social democrat parliamentary speaker , peter struck are a familiar sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck with his characteristic pipe and struck is by no means alone in fighting for moderate regulations in the german parliament which would continue to allow hardened smokers to puff away in the reichstag ’ s hallways and restaurants . many say if that ’ s no longer possible , they should be able to continue to smoke at least in their own offices . irresponsible behavior ? opposition green party mp birgit bender is appalled at what she describes as the irresponsible behavior of a few to the detriment of the majority of parliamentarians . “ you can ’ t really explain to people out in the country why they can still see mps puffing away happily in parliament , while at the same time the government has announced harsh measures to ban smoking at the workplace completely , " bender said .
" and there ’ s no reason to think that visitors to the bundestag and fellow parliamentarians should not be protected from the hazards of passive smoking .
i can only say that the omnipresent wafts of smoke in the hallways of the parliamentary building are increasingly getting on my nerves and respiratory tract and i ’ m no longer willing to endure them . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german mps do n't want the bundestag turning smoke-free in fact , most german mps seem to realize that any regulations on smoking in the bundestag or lower house of parliament which are laxer than those to be imposed on the rest of the country could send out a disastrous signal . that does n't mean that a few die-hard smokers across all mainstream parties have given up the fight for their perceived right to harm others . " a more level-headed approach " among them is opposition liberal democrat health affairs spokesman , detlef parr .
reacting to birgit bender ’ s call for a completely smoke-free bundestag , pfarr said a mountain was being made out a molehill . “ are the greens high on drugs or why are they constantly seeing crowds of suffering non-smokers whom i just can ’ t detect anywhere in this building ? "
pfarr said .
" the legislation as proposed by the cabinet is not yet in the bag , but the greens want to be two steps ahead yet again and foist regulations on us even before the house has debated the bill .
it only goes to show that the greens like nothing better than bans whenever they ’ re unable to come to terms with an issue , " he said .
" we liberal democrats think that a more level-headed approach would stand us parliamentarians in good stead . ” eventually , the matter will have to be decided by the bundestag ’ s council of elders .
it ’ s already indicated that there must be no special exceptions for smokers among parliamentarians . and the council is also in favor of imposing heavy fines for offenders .
the police , however , would have no way of enforcing these in the reichstag building .

but its own backyard seems to be an exception with some parliamentarians reluctant to stub out . alarmed by figures by the german cancer research centre which say that about 3,300 germans die of passive smoking annually , the government recently agreed on wide-reaching legislation that would outlaw smoking in public transport and other public buildings .

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .

working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have .

flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top .

that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "

the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .

" " we have warned them .
otherwise , you will not even see one corpse for these two agents , " said one of three masked gunmen who appeared to be standing behind the purported hostages . " those people are n't joking " the footage showed hannelore marianne krause , 61 urging the german government to help her .
it also showed krause 's passport .
krause wearing a blue headscarf was shown crying along with her dark-haired bearded son who sat on the floor next to her while she made a lengthy appeal in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the hostages has made a direct appeal to german chancellor merkel a written arabic translation of her statement said that she was calling on german chancellor angela merkel to save her life and that of her son by pulling out troops from afghanistan . " i have been held captive for a long time .
i beg you to help me .
i was very happy when you became chancellor but unfortunately until now you did not help me , " the translation said . " i am under threat .
these people want to kill my son in front of me and then kill me if german troops do not withdraw from afghanistan , " the translation said .
" please implement my demands .
those people are not joking . " she also asked german organizations to apply pressure on berlin to meet the kidnappers ' demands . in berlin , the german foreign ministry said a crisis team was studying the situation . germany a vocal opponent of the iraq war foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier confirmed on february 12 that two german citizens had been missing in iraq for a week and might have been abducted . the berlin daily tagesspiegel , citing security sources , reported at the time that the victims were a woman in her 60s , who is married to a iraqi doctor , and their son who is in his 20s . it is the third abduction of germans in iraq since the us-led war was launched in 2003 . according to the german foreign ministry there are still about a hundred german nationals in iraq , people working for german and international companies or diplomatic services .
germany has issued a security warning on travel to iraq due to the unstable security environment there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke were kidnapped in iraq last year about a year ago , two german technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke were released by their kidnappers after a three-month hostage ordeal .
and in november 2005 susanne osthoff , a german archeologist working for an aid organization , was released after the german government was reported to have paid a ransom to the tune of several million euros .
berlin however denies it . germany vehemently opposed the us-led war in iraq , but it does have 3,000 troops in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , where it commands the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aid worker killed in afghanistan ambush unknown gunmen shot dead a german aid worker in northern afghanistan thursday after letting three afghans he was travelling with go free , afghan officials said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 10.03.2007 despite planned ban , german mps fight for right to light up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german mps want to continue to have the right to do this in their offices the german government last month agreed to ban smoking in public transport and federal buildings .
but its own backyard seems to be an exception with some parliamentarians reluctant to stub out . alarmed by figures by the german cancer research centre which say that about 3,300 germans die of passive smoking annually , the government recently agreed on wide-reaching legislation that would outlaw smoking in public transport and other public buildings .
offenders could be fined up to 1,000 euros . but that ban does not extend to the german parliament .
the government is not entitled to influence the smoking behavior of the 614 mps in the national parliament building , the reichstag where images of the pipe-smoking social democrat parliamentary speaker , peter struck are a familiar sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck with his characteristic pipe and struck is by no means alone in fighting for moderate regulations in the german parliament which would continue to allow hardened smokers to puff away in the reichstag ’ s hallways and restaurants . many say if that ’ s no longer possible , they should be able to continue to smoke at least in their own offices . irresponsible behavior ? opposition green party mp birgit bender is appalled at what she describes as the irresponsible behavior of a few to the detriment of the majority of parliamentarians . “ you can ’ t really explain to people out in the country why they can still see mps puffing away happily in parliament , while at the same time the government has announced harsh measures to ban smoking at the workplace completely , " bender said .
" and there ’ s no reason to think that visitors to the bundestag and fellow parliamentarians should not be protected from the hazards of passive smoking .
i can only say that the omnipresent wafts of smoke in the hallways of the parliamentary building are increasingly getting on my nerves and respiratory tract and i ’ m no longer willing to endure them . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german mps do n't want the bundestag turning smoke-free in fact , most german mps seem to realize that any regulations on smoking in the bundestag or lower house of parliament which are laxer than those to be imposed on the rest of the country could send out a disastrous signal . that does n't mean that a few die-hard smokers across all mainstream parties have given up the fight for their perceived right to harm others . " a more level-headed approach " among them is opposition liberal democrat health affairs spokesman , detlef parr .
reacting to birgit bender ’ s call for a completely smoke-free bundestag , pfarr said a mountain was being made out a molehill . “ are the greens high on drugs or why are they constantly seeing crowds of suffering non-smokers whom i just can ’ t detect anywhere in this building ? "
pfarr said .
" the legislation as proposed by the cabinet is not yet in the bag , but the greens want to be two steps ahead yet again and foist regulations on us even before the house has debated the bill .
it only goes to show that the greens like nothing better than bans whenever they ’ re unable to come to terms with an issue , " he said .
" we liberal democrats think that a more level-headed approach would stand us parliamentarians in good stead . ” eventually , the matter will have to be decided by the bundestag ’ s council of elders .
it ’ s already indicated that there must be no special exceptions for smokers among parliamentarians . and the council is also in favor of imposing heavy fines for offenders .
the police , however , would have no way of enforcing these in the reichstag building .
their authority ends at the doors of the parliament building . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves smoking ban smokers in germany will be limited in exercising their addiction beginning in september .
the government has agreed to outlaw smoking in selected public areas , but stopped short of efforts to introduce a nationwide ban .
-lrb- 28.02.2007 -rrb- " germany will ring in 2008 smoke-free " dw-world.de spoke to german federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing about when germany will introduce protection against smoking and smoking bans - and why it is taking so long .
-lrb- 23.02.2007 -rrb- the power behind the german smoking ban stalemate as a crucial meeting on protecting non-smokers opens in germany friday , a look at the country 's powerful tobacco lobby offers some clues as to why germany has successfully resisted an outright smoking ban so far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : raising a family : germany debates daycare options school in the afternoon is new to germany , but catching on björn czinczoll : a kindergarten founder from germany value of women at heart of childcare debate new year babies bring extra prosperity in germany germany -pipe- 10.03.2007 reformist family minister raises hackles in conservative ranks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more daycare centers - and more kids german family minister ursula von der leyen has ruffled quite a few feathers with her plans for radical changes in family policy aimed at reversing the country 's dismally low birth rate . with an average of 1.3 children per woman , the fertility rate in germany ranks among the lowest in europe .
one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "
while it is important for young children to have a stable environment , they also need time for themselves , " he said .
the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .
" von der leyen 's family policies are not meant to benefit children 's well-being or strengthen family values but rather are mainly designed to recruit young women into industry , " he said .
the bishop said her policies are aimed at turning young women into " birthing machines . " reality bites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to encourage women to have kids despite the rumblings in conservative quarters , many believe that the gravity of germany 's demographic problems will eventually melt down the resistance to von der leyen 's plans . angela merkel has thrown her weight behind von der leyen 's proposals and even the catholic church has backed her . referring to the criticism of von der leyen from some cdu members , joachim meyer , president of the central committee of german catholics said : " with that kind of politics germany does its families no justice , and dramatically endangers its own future . " " apparently , those in the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union have prevailed who still refuse to accept the reality of young families , " meyer added . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de value of women at heart of childcare debate should germany triple the number of early child-care spots ?
along with financial questions , the proposal has stirred up an emotional debate over the roles of women and families in german society .
-lrb- 28.02.2007 -rrb- german bishop slammed for calling women " birthing machines " a german bishop has sharply criticized government plans to improve childcare facilities , saying they reduce women to " birthing machines " who quickly have to return to work .

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "
while it is important for young children to have a stable environment , they also need time for themselves , " he said .
the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .
" von der leyen 's family policies are not meant to benefit children 's well-being or strengthen family values but rather are mainly designed to recruit young women into industry , " he said .
the bishop said her policies are aimed at turning young women into " birthing machines . " reality bites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to encourage women to have kids despite the rumblings in conservative quarters , many believe that the gravity of germany 's demographic problems will eventually melt down the resistance to von der leyen 's plans . angela merkel has thrown her weight behind von der leyen 's proposals and even the catholic church has backed her . referring to the criticism of von der leyen from some cdu members , joachim meyer , president of the central committee of german catholics said : " with that kind of politics germany does its families no justice , and dramatically endangers its own future . " " apparently , those in the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union have prevailed who still refuse to accept the reality of young families , " meyer added . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de value of women at heart of childcare debate should germany triple the number of early child-care spots ?

the average dachshund currently costs between 500 and 600 euros -lrb- $ 655 and $ 786 -rrb- . honsalek added that it was a dachshund 's independence , and sometimes even stubbornness , that convinced him to have 15 of the dogs , careful to point out that not all dachshunds are the same . competition from abroad heavier dachshunds that can barely keep their stomachs from brushing the ground are members of an american breed and unlike slimmer german dogs that , at nine kilograms -lrb- 19.8 pounds -rrb- , weigh in a good five kilos less than their american cousins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the prince of denmark see you in there !

" every victory is good for the confidence , especially if it comes against real , " goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn told thursday 's edition of kicker sports magazine .

we have come back into contention in the bundesliga and in europe .
now we need to concentrate on the bremen match . " bremen 's confidence is also on the rise after a victory last week over bochum . " our crisis is over , " said defender clemens fritz .
" we can achieve both , advancing into the uefa cup final and winning the bundesliga . " perennial runners up ? schalke hope to end their misery at mid-table hanover 96 , but the loss of brazilian forward lincoln , who will be serving the second match in a five-game ban , and defender dario rodriguez , who will be out after picking up a fifth yellow card , will make the endeavor a challenge . in third place by a four-point margin , stuttgart look to have the least pressure on them this weekend playing at home against wolfsburg , who are only two points away from the relegation zone . despite being kicked out of the top spot by bayern a number of times in recent years , neither schalke nor stuttgart are willing to admit to a gnawing feeling in the back of their minds that the bavarians could be approaching . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn said bayern still has plenty of time to draw and quarter the competition schalke coach mirko slomka shrugged off munich 's comeback , saying , " we are not looking at teams behind us .

" there would be something very wrong if we did n't believe in our chance .
you always have to watch out for us , until the very last second of the season . " elsewhere , improving sv hamburg run into bayer leverkusen in the other sunday game .
hamburg have won their last four games , including success in bremen and schalke .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : raising a family : germany debates daycare options school in the afternoon is new to germany , but catching on björn czinczoll : a kindergarten founder from germany value of women at heart of childcare debate new year babies bring extra prosperity in germany germany -pipe- 10.03.2007 reformist family minister raises hackles in conservative ranks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more daycare centers - and more kids german family minister ursula von der leyen has ruffled quite a few feathers with her plans for radical changes in family policy aimed at reversing the country 's dismally low birth rate . with an average of 1.3 children per woman , the fertility rate in germany ranks among the lowest in europe .
one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "
while it is important for young children to have a stable environment , they also need time for themselves , " he said .
the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .
" von der leyen 's family policies are not meant to benefit children 's well-being or strengthen family values but rather are mainly designed to recruit young women into industry , " he said .
the bishop said her policies are aimed at turning young women into " birthing machines . " reality bites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to encourage women to have kids despite the rumblings in conservative quarters , many believe that the gravity of germany 's demographic problems will eventually melt down the resistance to von der leyen 's plans . angela merkel has thrown her weight behind von der leyen 's proposals and even the catholic church has backed her . referring to the criticism of von der leyen from some cdu members , joachim meyer , president of the central committee of german catholics said : " with that kind of politics germany does its families no justice , and dramatically endangers its own future . " " apparently , those in the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union have prevailed who still refuse to accept the reality of young families , " meyer added . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de value of women at heart of childcare debate should germany triple the number of early child-care spots ?
along with financial questions , the proposal has stirred up an emotional debate over the roles of women and families in german society .

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "
while it is important for young children to have a stable environment , they also need time for themselves , " he said .
the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .
" von der leyen 's family policies are not meant to benefit children 's well-being or strengthen family values but rather are mainly designed to recruit young women into industry , " he said .
the bishop said her policies are aimed at turning young women into " birthing machines .

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "
while it is important for young children to have a stable environment , they also need time for themselves , " he said .
the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .
" von der leyen 's family policies are not meant to benefit children 's well-being or strengthen family values but rather are mainly designed to recruit young women into industry , " he said .
the bishop said her policies are aimed at turning young women into " birthing machines . " reality bites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to encourage women to have kids despite the rumblings in conservative quarters , many believe that the gravity of germany 's demographic problems will eventually melt down the resistance to von der leyen 's plans . angela merkel has thrown her weight behind von der leyen 's proposals and even the catholic church has backed her . referring to the criticism of von der leyen from some cdu members , joachim meyer , president of the central committee of german catholics said : " with that kind of politics germany does its families no justice , and dramatically endangers its own future . " " apparently , those in the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union have prevailed who still refuse to accept the reality of young families , " meyer added . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de value of women at heart of childcare debate should germany triple the number of early child-care spots ?

but its own backyard seems to be an exception with some parliamentarians reluctant to stub out . alarmed by figures by the german cancer research centre which say that about 3,300 germans die of passive smoking annually , the government recently agreed on wide-reaching legislation that would outlaw smoking in public transport and other public buildings .
offenders could be fined up to 1,000 euros . but that ban does not extend to the german parliament .
the government is not entitled to influence the smoking behavior of the 614 mps in the national parliament building , the reichstag where images of the pipe-smoking social democrat parliamentary speaker , peter struck are a familiar sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck with his characteristic pipe and struck is by no means alone in fighting for moderate regulations in the german parliament which would continue to allow hardened smokers to puff away in the reichstag ’ s hallways and restaurants . many say if that ’ s no longer possible , they should be able to continue to smoke at least in their own offices . irresponsible behavior ? opposition green party mp birgit bender is appalled at what she describes as the irresponsible behavior of a few to the detriment of the majority of parliamentarians . “ you can ’ t really explain to people out in the country why they can still see mps puffing away happily in parliament , while at the same time the government has announced harsh measures to ban smoking at the workplace completely , " bender said .
" and there ’ s no reason to think that visitors to the bundestag and fellow parliamentarians should not be protected from the hazards of passive smoking .
i can only say that the omnipresent wafts of smoke in the hallways of the parliamentary building are increasingly getting on my nerves and respiratory tract and i ’ m no longer willing to endure them . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german mps do n't want the bundestag turning smoke-free in fact , most german mps seem to realize that any regulations on smoking in the bundestag or lower house of parliament which are laxer than those to be imposed on the rest of the country could send out a disastrous signal . that does n't mean that a few die-hard smokers across all mainstream parties have given up the fight for their perceived right to harm others . " a more level-headed approach " among them is opposition liberal democrat health affairs spokesman , detlef parr .
reacting to birgit bender ’ s call for a completely smoke-free bundestag , pfarr said a mountain was being made out a molehill . “ are the greens high on drugs or why are they constantly seeing crowds of suffering non-smokers whom i just can ’ t detect anywhere in this building ? "
pfarr said .

it only goes to show that the greens like nothing better than bans whenever they ’ re unable to come to terms with an issue , " he said .
" we liberal democrats think that a more level-headed approach would stand us parliamentarians in good stead . ” eventually , the matter will have to be decided by the bundestag ’ s council of elders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2007 despite planned ban , german mps fight for right to light up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german mps want to continue to have the right to do this in their offices the german government last month agreed to ban smoking in public transport and federal buildings .
but its own backyard seems to be an exception with some parliamentarians reluctant to stub out . alarmed by figures by the german cancer research centre which say that about 3,300 germans die of passive smoking annually , the government recently agreed on wide-reaching legislation that would outlaw smoking in public transport and other public buildings .
offenders could be fined up to 1,000 euros . but that ban does not extend to the german parliament .
the government is not entitled to influence the smoking behavior of the 614 mps in the national parliament building , the reichstag where images of the pipe-smoking social democrat parliamentary speaker , peter struck are a familiar sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck with his characteristic pipe and struck is by no means alone in fighting for moderate regulations in the german parliament which would continue to allow hardened smokers to puff away in the reichstag ’ s hallways and restaurants . many say if that ’ s no longer possible , they should be able to continue to smoke at least in their own offices . irresponsible behavior ? opposition green party mp birgit bender is appalled at what she describes as the irresponsible behavior of a few to the detriment of the majority of parliamentarians . “ you can ’ t really explain to people out in the country why they can still see mps puffing away happily in parliament , while at the same time the government has announced harsh measures to ban smoking at the workplace completely , " bender said .
" and there ’ s no reason to think that visitors to the bundestag and fellow parliamentarians should not be protected from the hazards of passive smoking .
i can only say that the omnipresent wafts of smoke in the hallways of the parliamentary building are increasingly getting on my nerves and respiratory tract and i ’ m no longer willing to endure them . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german mps do n't want the bundestag turning smoke-free in fact , most german mps seem to realize that any regulations on smoking in the bundestag or lower house of parliament which are laxer than those to be imposed on the rest of the country could send out a disastrous signal . that does n't mean that a few die-hard smokers across all mainstream parties have given up the fight for their perceived right to harm others . " a more level-headed approach " among them is opposition liberal democrat health affairs spokesman , detlef parr .
reacting to birgit bender ’ s call for a completely smoke-free bundestag , pfarr said a mountain was being made out a molehill . “ are the greens high on drugs or why are they constantly seeing crowds of suffering non-smokers whom i just can ’ t detect anywhere in this building ? "
pfarr said .
" the legislation as proposed by the cabinet is not yet in the bag , but the greens want to be two steps ahead yet again and foist regulations on us even before the house has debated the bill .
it only goes to show that the greens like nothing better than bans whenever they ’ re unable to come to terms with an issue , " he said .
" we liberal democrats think that a more level-headed approach would stand us parliamentarians in good stead . ” eventually , the matter will have to be decided by the bundestag ’ s council of elders .
it ’ s already indicated that there must be no special exceptions for smokers among parliamentarians . and the council is also in favor of imposing heavy fines for offenders .
the police , however , would have no way of enforcing these in the reichstag building .
their authority ends at the doors of the parliament building . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves smoking ban smokers in germany will be limited in exercising their addiction beginning in september .

" every victory is good for the confidence , especially if it comes against real , " goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn told thursday 's edition of kicker sports magazine .
" this has further strengthened my belief that a lot is possible this season . " munich coach ottmar hitzfeld said he also believes bayern can defend the german league title they won last season , but emphasized that there is still plenty to be decided . bundesliga work remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld has managed bayern into the champions league quarterfinals on wednesday " we have made it to the quarterfinals but in the bundesliga we are not in the champions league places , " he said .
" it 's still a critical situation and we have n't achieved anything yet .
we have come back into contention in the bundesliga and in europe .
now we need to concentrate on the bremen match . " bremen 's confidence is also on the rise after a victory last week over bochum . " our crisis is over , " said defender clemens fritz .
" we can achieve both , advancing into the uefa cup final and winning the bundesliga . " perennial runners up ? schalke hope to end their misery at mid-table hanover 96 , but the loss of brazilian forward lincoln , who will be serving the second match in a five-game ban , and defender dario rodriguez , who will be out after picking up a fifth yellow card , will make the endeavor a challenge . in third place by a four-point margin , stuttgart look to have the least pressure on them this weekend playing at home against wolfsburg , who are only two points away from the relegation zone . despite being kicked out of the top spot by bayern a number of times in recent years , neither schalke nor stuttgart are willing to admit to a gnawing feeling in the back of their minds that the bavarians could be approaching . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn said bayern still has plenty of time to draw and quarter the competition schalke coach mirko slomka shrugged off munich 's comeback , saying , " we are not looking at teams behind us . "
his stuttgart counterpart armin veh agreed , " we are not looking at bayern . " kahn : forget us at your peril but munich keeper kahn said he thinks they should be . " there are 10 games left and we have a six-point deficit , " the keeper said .
" there would be something very wrong if we did n't believe in our chance .
you always have to watch out for us , until the very last second of the season . " elsewhere , improving sv hamburg run into bayer leverkusen in the other sunday game .
hamburg have won their last four games , including success in bremen and schalke .
leverkusen have two wins in a row , at schalke and against stuttgart . the other weekend games are nuremberg vs. eintracht frankfurt , borussia mönchengladbach vs. hertha berlin , vfl bochum vs. borussia dortmund , mainz 05 vs. arminia bielefeld and energie cottbus vs. alemannia aachen . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitzfeld works the old champions league magic bayern munich 's veteran coach ottmar hitzfeld could barely disguise his excitement after the club he returned to a month ago reached the champions league quarterfinals at real madrid 's expense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : raising a family : germany debates daycare options school in the afternoon is new to germany , but catching on björn czinczoll : a kindergarten founder from germany value of women at heart of childcare debate new year babies bring extra prosperity in germany germany -pipe- 10.03.2007 reformist family minister raises hackles in conservative ranks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more daycare centers - and more kids german family minister ursula von der leyen has ruffled quite a few feathers with her plans for radical changes in family policy aimed at reversing the country 's dismally low birth rate . with an average of 1.3 children per woman , the fertility rate in germany ranks among the lowest in europe .
one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof .

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "
while it is important for young children to have a stable environment , they also need time for themselves , " he said .
the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .
" von der leyen 's family policies are not meant to benefit children 's well-being or strengthen family values but rather are mainly designed to recruit young women into industry , " he said .
the bishop said her policies are aimed at turning young women into " birthing machines . " reality bites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to encourage women to have kids despite the rumblings in conservative quarters , many believe that the gravity of germany 's demographic problems will eventually melt down the resistance to von der leyen 's plans . angela merkel has thrown her weight behind von der leyen 's proposals and even the catholic church has backed her . referring to the criticism of von der leyen from some cdu members , joachim meyer , president of the central committee of german catholics said : " with that kind of politics germany does its families no justice , and dramatically endangers its own future .

" despite his professed love of the dachshund , which he said he would like to be if ever reincarnated , the dogs may still wish to keep out of copenhagen for the time being .
the prince also announced in may that he loved the taste of dog meat , likening it to slightly dry veal and adding that it tasted best when sauteed or grilled and cut into thin slices . birgit bütter of the german dog association , however , said the german dachshund is getting on just fine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2007 despite planned ban , german mps fight for right to light up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german mps want to continue to have the right to do this in their offices the german government last month agreed to ban smoking in public transport and federal buildings .
but its own backyard seems to be an exception with some parliamentarians reluctant to stub out . alarmed by figures by the german cancer research centre which say that about 3,300 germans die of passive smoking annually , the government recently agreed on wide-reaching legislation that would outlaw smoking in public transport and other public buildings .
offenders could be fined up to 1,000 euros . but that ban does not extend to the german parliament .
the government is not entitled to influence the smoking behavior of the 614 mps in the national parliament building , the reichstag where images of the pipe-smoking social democrat parliamentary speaker , peter struck are a familiar sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck with his characteristic pipe and struck is by no means alone in fighting for moderate regulations in the german parliament which would continue to allow hardened smokers to puff away in the reichstag ’ s hallways and restaurants . many say if that ’ s no longer possible , they should be able to continue to smoke at least in their own offices . irresponsible behavior ? opposition green party mp birgit bender is appalled at what she describes as the irresponsible behavior of a few to the detriment of the majority of parliamentarians . “ you can ’ t really explain to people out in the country why they can still see mps puffing away happily in parliament , while at the same time the government has announced harsh measures to ban smoking at the workplace completely , " bender said .
" and there ’ s no reason to think that visitors to the bundestag and fellow parliamentarians should not be protected from the hazards of passive smoking .
i can only say that the omnipresent wafts of smoke in the hallways of the parliamentary building are increasingly getting on my nerves and respiratory tract and i ’ m no longer willing to endure them . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german mps do n't want the bundestag turning smoke-free in fact , most german mps seem to realize that any regulations on smoking in the bundestag or lower house of parliament which are laxer than those to be imposed on the rest of the country could send out a disastrous signal . that does n't mean that a few die-hard smokers across all mainstream parties have given up the fight for their perceived right to harm others . " a more level-headed approach " among them is opposition liberal democrat health affairs spokesman , detlef parr .
reacting to birgit bender ’ s call for a completely smoke-free bundestag , pfarr said a mountain was being made out a molehill . “ are the greens high on drugs or why are they constantly seeing crowds of suffering non-smokers whom i just can ’ t detect anywhere in this building ? "
pfarr said .
" the legislation as proposed by the cabinet is not yet in the bag , but the greens want to be two steps ahead yet again and foist regulations on us even before the house has debated the bill .
it only goes to show that the greens like nothing better than bans whenever they ’ re unable to come to terms with an issue , " he said .
" we liberal democrats think that a more level-headed approach would stand us parliamentarians in good stead . ” eventually , the matter will have to be decided by the bundestag ’ s council of elders .
it ’ s already indicated that there must be no special exceptions for smokers among parliamentarians . and the council is also in favor of imposing heavy fines for offenders .
the police , however , would have no way of enforcing these in the reichstag building .
their authority ends at the doors of the parliament building . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves smoking ban smokers in germany will be limited in exercising their addiction beginning in september .
the government has agreed to outlaw smoking in selected public areas , but stopped short of efforts to introduce a nationwide ban .
-lrb- 28.02.2007 -rrb- " germany will ring in 2008 smoke-free " dw-world.de spoke to german federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing about when germany will introduce protection against smoking and smoking bans - and why it is taking so long .
-lrb- 23.02.2007 -rrb- the power behind the german smoking ban stalemate as a crucial meeting on protecting non-smokers opens in germany friday , a look at the country 's powerful tobacco lobby offers some clues as to why germany has successfully resisted an outright smoking ban so far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2007 despite planned ban , german mps fight for right to light up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german mps want to continue to have the right to do this in their offices the german government last month agreed to ban smoking in public transport and federal buildings .
but its own backyard seems to be an exception with some parliamentarians reluctant to stub out . alarmed by figures by the german cancer research centre which say that about 3,300 germans die of passive smoking annually , the government recently agreed on wide-reaching legislation that would outlaw smoking in public transport and other public buildings .
offenders could be fined up to 1,000 euros . but that ban does not extend to the german parliament .
the government is not entitled to influence the smoking behavior of the 614 mps in the national parliament building , the reichstag where images of the pipe-smoking social democrat parliamentary speaker , peter struck are a familiar sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck with his characteristic pipe and struck is by no means alone in fighting for moderate regulations in the german parliament which would continue to allow hardened smokers to puff away in the reichstag ’ s hallways and restaurants . many say if that ’ s no longer possible , they should be able to continue to smoke at least in their own offices . irresponsible behavior ? opposition green party mp birgit bender is appalled at what she describes as the irresponsible behavior of a few to the detriment of the majority of parliamentarians . “ you can ’ t really explain to people out in the country why they can still see mps puffing away happily in parliament , while at the same time the government has announced harsh measures to ban smoking at the workplace completely , " bender said .
" and there ’ s no reason to think that visitors to the bundestag and fellow parliamentarians should not be protected from the hazards of passive smoking .
i can only say that the omnipresent wafts of smoke in the hallways of the parliamentary building are increasingly getting on my nerves and respiratory tract and i ’ m no longer willing to endure them . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german mps do n't want the bundestag turning smoke-free in fact , most german mps seem to realize that any regulations on smoking in the bundestag or lower house of parliament which are laxer than those to be imposed on the rest of the country could send out a disastrous signal . that does n't mean that a few die-hard smokers across all mainstream parties have given up the fight for their perceived right to harm others . " a more level-headed approach " among them is opposition liberal democrat health affairs spokesman , detlef parr .
reacting to birgit bender ’ s call for a completely smoke-free bundestag , pfarr said a mountain was being made out a molehill . “ are the greens high on drugs or why are they constantly seeing crowds of suffering non-smokers whom i just can ’ t detect anywhere in this building ? "
pfarr said .
" the legislation as proposed by the cabinet is not yet in the bag , but the greens want to be two steps ahead yet again and foist regulations on us even before the house has debated the bill .
it only goes to show that the greens like nothing better than bans whenever they ’ re unable to come to terms with an issue , " he said .
" we liberal democrats think that a more level-headed approach would stand us parliamentarians in good stead . ” eventually , the matter will have to be decided by the bundestag ’ s council of elders .
it ’ s already indicated that there must be no special exceptions for smokers among parliamentarians . and the council is also in favor of imposing heavy fines for offenders .
the police , however , would have no way of enforcing these in the reichstag building .
their authority ends at the doors of the parliament building . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet approves smoking ban smokers in germany will be limited in exercising their addiction beginning in september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : raising a family : germany debates daycare options school in the afternoon is new to germany , but catching on björn czinczoll : a kindergarten founder from germany value of women at heart of childcare debate new year babies bring extra prosperity in germany germany -pipe- 10.03.2007 reformist family minister raises hackles in conservative ranks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more daycare centers - and more kids german family minister ursula von der leyen has ruffled quite a few feathers with her plans for radical changes in family policy aimed at reversing the country 's dismally low birth rate . with an average of 1.3 children per woman , the fertility rate in germany ranks among the lowest in europe .
one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard .

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "
while it is important for young children to have a stable environment , they also need time for themselves , " he said .

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "
while it is important for young children to have a stable environment , they also need time for themselves , " he said .
the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .
" von der leyen 's family policies are not meant to benefit children 's well-being or strengthen family values but rather are mainly designed to recruit young women into industry , " he said .
the bishop said her policies are aimed at turning young women into " birthing machines . " reality bites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to encourage women to have kids despite the rumblings in conservative quarters , many believe that the gravity of germany 's demographic problems will eventually melt down the resistance to von der leyen 's plans . angela merkel has thrown her weight behind von der leyen 's proposals and even the catholic church has backed her . referring to the criticism of von der leyen from some cdu members , joachim meyer , president of the central committee of german catholics said : " with that kind of politics germany does its families no justice , and dramatically endangers its own future . " " apparently , those in the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union have prevailed who still refuse to accept the reality of young families , " meyer added . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de value of women at heart of childcare debate should germany triple the number of early child-care spots ?

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "
while it is important for young children to have a stable environment , they also need time for themselves , " he said .
the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .
" von der leyen 's family policies are not meant to benefit children 's well-being or strengthen family values but rather are mainly designed to recruit young women into industry , " he said .
the bishop said her policies are aimed at turning young women into " birthing machines . " reality bites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to encourage women to have kids despite the rumblings in conservative quarters , many believe that the gravity of germany 's demographic problems will eventually melt down the resistance to von der leyen 's plans . angela merkel has thrown her weight behind von der leyen 's proposals and even the catholic church has backed her . referring to the criticism of von der leyen from some cdu members , joachim meyer , president of the central committee of german catholics said : " with that kind of politics germany does its families no justice , and dramatically endangers its own future . " " apparently , those in the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union have prevailed who still refuse to accept the reality of young families , " meyer added . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de value of women at heart of childcare debate should germany triple the number of early child-care spots ?

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "
while it is important for young children to have a stable environment , they also need time for themselves , " he said .
the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .
" von der leyen 's family policies are not meant to benefit children 's well-being or strengthen family values but rather are mainly designed to recruit young women into industry , " he said .

the average dachshund currently costs between 500 and 600 euros -lrb- $ 655 and $ 786 -rrb- . honsalek added that it was a dachshund 's independence , and sometimes even stubbornness , that convinced him to have 15 of the dogs , careful to point out that not all dachshunds are the same . competition from abroad heavier dachshunds that can barely keep their stomachs from brushing the ground are members of an american breed and unlike slimmer german dogs that , at nine kilograms -lrb- 19.8 pounds -rrb- , weigh in a good five kilos less than their american cousins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the prince of denmark see you in there !
in addition to the american breed , the traditional german symbol is also facing competition from denmark , where prince henrik , president of the country 's dachshund society , dedicated a poem to royal sausage dog evita : " i love to pet your fur / and see it fall smooth / you dear , you special dog . " despite his professed love of the dachshund , which he said he would like to be if ever reincarnated , the dogs may still wish to keep out of copenhagen for the time being .
the prince also announced in may that he loved the taste of dog meat , likening it to slightly dry veal and adding that it tasted best when sauteed or grilled and cut into thin slices . birgit bütter of the german dog association , however , said the german dachshund is getting on just fine .

one of the many consequences of the ageing population can already be felt today , as the overall cost of health care continues to rise sharply . at the same time , the german government has been slow to adapt its family policies to the exigencies of the typical modern family .
working women in germany have a particularly hard time getting back into the labor market once they have a child due to the lack of full-day schools , kindergartens and day-care centers , which in part explain the low birth rate in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen : super-mom and party rebel now there 's a ray of hope in the form of ursula von der leyen , minister for family affairs in chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet .
a mother of seven , von der leyen knows firsthand how tricky juggling work and children can be . " i 'm like most parents , " the minister said recently .
" i wish i had more time .
but i 've learned that if time with your family is so scarce , then you end up fighting anything that detracts from the little time you have . " sending a clear signal when she assumed office in 2005 , hardly anyone thought the slender blonde with the ready smile and the soft voice would bring about radical change . a member of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the conservative cdu is not exactly famous for its liberal policies towards women . but the 48-year-old family minister had her own ideas about overhauling germany 's family policies .
flying in the face of opposition from within her own ranks , von der leyen created a radical new financing scheme for parents . under the plan which came into effect on january 1 , the federal government pays mothers or fathers two-thirds of their last net paycheck - up to € 1,800 -lrb- $ 2,360 -rrb- - for up to 12 months as long as they stay at home to take care of the baby .
and if the other parent takes an additional two months off to care for the child , the government heaps two more months of pay on top . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " the family minister told german daily der tagesspiegel when the new measure took effect . von der leyen hopes it will be an incentive for germans to have more babies . " we want to financially support parents with new babies , " she says .
" we want to prevent them from losing their incomes when they 're doing the best thing that can happen to a nation : having kids . " she was right : the scheme is proving incredibly popular among german voters , and von der leyen 's approval ratings shot through the roof . " raven mother " tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working moms have a tough time in germany von der leyen is now taking her reforming zeal a step further and advocating sharply increasing the number of daycare centers for kids under three years old . von der leyen wants to provide enough cash to triple the number of daycare places to 750,000 by 2013 .
that would provide enough places for one third of all eligible children , she told the german public broadcaster ard . " that would just barely put us on par with the european average , " she said . what seems like a simple idea is in fact a difficult proposal in a country where pre-schoolers tend to stay at home , and mothers who send their kids out into the world too soon are privately labeled " raven mothers . "
this is because the raven , a common bird , is known to push its young out of the nest at a very early age . family counselor , jan-uwe rogge however dismissed the " raven mother " complex as " ideological nonsense . "
while it is important for young children to have a stable environment , they also need time for themselves , " he said .
the idea of the " raven mother " has more to do with old-fashioned social roles for women , rogge said , than with pedagogical considerations . indeed , much of the opposition that von der leyen faces is ideological as entrenched attitudes in germany towards family and the role of women are proving hard to change .
many conservatives from von der leyen 's own party have criticized her proposals and questioned where she would get the money for it . walter mixa , a catholic bishop from bavaria , found especially scathing words for the minister .
" von der leyen 's family policies are not meant to benefit children 's well-being or strengthen family values but rather are mainly designed to recruit young women into industry , " he said .
the bishop said her policies are aimed at turning young women into " birthing machines . " reality bites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to encourage women to have kids despite the rumblings in conservative quarters , many believe that the gravity of germany 's demographic problems will eventually melt down the resistance to von der leyen 's plans . angela merkel has thrown her weight behind von der leyen 's proposals and even the catholic church has backed her . referring to the criticism of von der leyen from some cdu members , joachim meyer , president of the central committee of german catholics said : " with that kind of politics germany does its families no justice , and dramatically endangers its own future . " " apparently , those in the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union have prevailed who still refuse to accept the reality of young families , " meyer added . alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : value of women at heart of childcare debate should germany triple the number of early child-care spots ?
along with financial questions , the proposal has stirred up an emotional debate over the roles of women and families in german society .

he was at a football stadium in the argentine capital , buenos aires , leading what he called an anti-imperialist rally to coincide with mr bush 's arrival in neighbouring uruguay .
most of the crowd were members of trade unions , left-wing and human rights organisations , those who already supported mr chavez and what he calls his brand of socialism for the 21st century .
others had come simply out of curiosity to see with their own eyes the man who was grabbing so many headlines - the man who dares to stand up and insult the leader of the most powerful country in the world .
marcos said : " i am here because i think it is necessary to demonstrate against not only the usa but also against the policies that put at risk lives in the countries they conquer and in the whole world .
we have to demonstrate . "
graciela added : " i think chavez has many good things although i do n't agree with him 100 % .
but , if i had to choose between the two i do know i prefer chavez and that is why i am here . "
loud and clear chavez was in his element as he addressed the crowd all the main left-wing groups waved their huge flags , making it difficult for many to see the venezuelan leader on the stage .
but the powerful sound system ensured that they had no problems hearing him .
families with small children brought picnics and groups of friends joined in the insult hurling on a balmy evening .
buses that had brought thousands from the outlying regions of buenos aires lined the neighbouring streets .
mr chavez , in his customary red shirt , called mr bush a political corpse and , in his best english , repeated what has almost become his regular slogan : " gringo , go home ! "
filling a void there is little doubt that the two men are battling for hearts and souls in latin america .
when president bush took office he said latin america would be a priority .
then came 9/11 and washington 's focus shifted to the middle east .
many analysts accuse the united states of neglecting their own backyard .
that 's a charge the us president denies although he did say his tour of brazil , uruguay , colombia , guatemala and mexico was designed partly to put his message across more clearly .
hugo chavez has moved quickly to fill the void left by the united states .
he strikes a chord with many in latin america 's shanty towns and leaders in the region ca n't afford to ignore him .
but many also want to stay on the right side of washington and the argentine president , nestor kirchner , was not at the anti-imperialist rally , neither were senior members of his government .
he may agree with much of what mr chavez says but still wants to deal with the united states and many leaders in the region are trying hard to stay friends with both men , not easy when they are so far apart on the political spectrum .
mr chavez moves on to bolivia for a meeting with one of his main allies in the region , president evo morales , to continue talking about latin american integration .
president bush expected protests .
he said he welcomed the demonstration of free speech .
but he might not have expected them to be so ferocious and knows he has got his work cut out if he is going to convince latin americans that the united states , and not venezuela , should be leading the way forward .

the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- said the system was badly organised , failed to draw out expertise and could not cope with demand .
initial findings of an independent review have now revealed the process has " shortcomings " and should change .
health minister lord hunt has apologised to those affected .
he told the bbc 's the world tonight : " i 'm certainly very sorry if junior doctors have been affected adversely in this way and that 's why , when it became apparent from the meetings that we had with doctors early in the week , we set up this review . "
he said the department of health -lrb- doh -rrb- had been working " very hard " with the medical royal colleges and the bma to deal with " the key problems " of the system .
boycott threat " i know that this has been a difficult time for junior doctors and i hope that this reassures them that we have listened to their concerns , " he said .
the doh had rejected calls from the bma to suspend the current round of interviews for specialist training posts , which began this week .
but it went on to order a review of the system after consultants threatened to boycott the interviews , claiming the system was flawed and unfair .
in a statement , the doh said there will now be " significant " changes to the second round of interviews , which is due to begin in april .
this will include allowing applicants to provide cvs and portfolios to support their applications .
at present no cv can be included with an application form .
in addition , there will be changes to the application form and the scoring system , as well as better support and feedback for candidates .
the doh said : " the department has accepted the need for change and the revised approach will now be tested with junior doctors , selectors , deanery recruitment teams and employers . "
those who have already been refused will be able to have their applications reconsidered .
competitive the new system was designed to speed up the progress of doctors ' training so juniors could reach consultant level in an average of 11 years , rather than the current 14 .
however , doctors who have been through their initial stage of training under both the old and the new systems are all competing for a limited number of specialist training posts .
this is the point at which a doctor would select to focus on an area of expertise , such as cancer medicine or paediatrics .
around 30,000 applicants are chasing 22,000 available jobs .
in addition , doctors who were applying for training posts online also faced problems with the computer systems which meant many well-qualified candidates were not offered interviews .
anil ghosh , a junior doctor from oxfordshire , told the bbc 's the world tonight that the changes were a step in the right direction .
but he added : " i still think that , although in reality we are being given a second chance or a half chance of reapplying , that the system is not particularly fair as they are still not interviewing the best candidates in the first place . "
the final report of the review , chaired by professor neil douglas , vice-president of the academy of medical royal colleges , will be published by the end of the month .

award-winning cartoonist steve bell has been drawing political cartoons for the guardian for the last 25 years .
during that time he has created many memorable images of politicians including john major as a grey superhero wearing y-fronts , margaret thatcher as a mad woman , and tony blair with his flashing eyeball .
other iconic bell caricatures include john prescott as a bulldog and us president george bush as a chimpanzee .
bell 's cartoons have always tackled controversial and difficult subjects , and the current war in iraq continues to provide plenty of ammunition for the comic 's scathing pen .
but how did steve bell 's life in cartoons get started and where do the roots of his incredible talent lie ?
early years steve bell was born in 1951 in london , and raised in slough in south east england .
he moved to north yorkshire in 1968 , where he studied fine art at teesside college of art , before moving to leeds university from which he graduated in 1974 with a ba in fine art .
bell then took a teaching certificate at exeter university , and worked briefly as an art teacher in birmingham , later describing the experience as " hell on earth " .
after his brief flirtation with teaching , he left education to follow a freelance career as a cartoonist .
his political cartoons were featured in a variety of publications including whoopee , cheeky , jackpot , new society , the leveller , nme , time out , city limits , new statesman , private eye , and punch .
amongst his first comic strips was maggie 's farm which was published in time out magazine .
during these early days bell was already getting under the skin of the establishment - the maggie 's farm cartoons were condemned in the house of lords as " an almost obscene series of caricatures " .
in the nation 's eye bell 's seminal cartoons drew interest from the guardian , and he joined the paper on a month 's trial in summer 1981 , developing a series of 24 strip cartoons for them .
so impressed was the guardian that steve was offered a permanent job .
his first if ¿ cartoon strip appeared in november 1981 and has proved to be hugely successful ever since .
steve 's arrival at the guardian was perfectly timed to capture key events in 1982 - the falklands war started soon after he joined the paper and he was able to capture the controversy surrounding the war with a caricaturist 's eye .
these cartoons also marked an early appearance of commander jack middletar and able seaman reg kipling , in the armoured punt hms incredible , one of bell 's most memorable images .
this was accompanied by early drawings of bell 's famous penguin , which has become a recurrent motif in his work down the years .

he depicted prime minister margaret thatcher as a psychotic woman , " a swivel-eyed heroine " .
during the 1990s bell captured the essence of prime minister john major , depicting him as a useless , superhero wearing his aertex underpants outside his trousers .
when tony blair became prime minister , bell openly admits that it took while to ' get him ' , but a trip to a labour party conference provided a revelatory moment .
bell spotted a strange psychotic glint in one of the prime minister 's eyes , redolent of margaret thatcher - and the ' blair eye ' became one of the cartoonist 's motifs .
capturing politics on paper steve bell 's work has published a large number of books of his work and has won numerous awards .
in 1993 he was the what the papers say cartoonist of the year and also scooped the political cartoon society cartoon of the year award in 2001 , the cartoonist of the year in 2005 , and the british press awards cartoonist of the year in 2002 .
steve has also won the cartoon arts trust award best strip cartoonist and / or best political cartoonist eight times .
as well his political caricatures , other popular bell cartoon characters include the old hack harry hardnose , lord god almighty , creator of heaven and earth , and the french monsieur l 'artiste , who some say is a caricature of bell .
steve bell remains one of britain 's most searing political cartoonists and continues to sharpen his political pencil in the guardian and his many publications .

award-winning cartoonist steve bell has been drawing political cartoons for the guardian for the last 25 years .
during that time he has created many memorable images of politicians including john major as a grey superhero wearing y-fronts , margaret thatcher as a mad woman , and tony blair with his flashing eyeball .
other iconic bell caricatures include john prescott as a bulldog and us president george bush as a chimpanzee .
bell 's cartoons have always tackled controversial and difficult subjects , and the current war in iraq continues to provide plenty of ammunition for the comic 's scathing pen .
but how did steve bell 's life in cartoons get started and where do the roots of his incredible talent lie ?
early years adoration of the majori © steve bell steve bell was born in 1951 in london , and raised in slough in south east england .
he moved to north yorkshire in 1968 , where he studied fine art at teesside college of art , before moving to leeds university from which he graduated in 1974 with a ba in fine art .
bell then took a teaching certificate at exeter university , and worked briefly as an art teacher in birmingham , later describing the experience as " hell on earth " .
after his brief flirtation with teaching , he left education to follow a freelance career as a cartoonist .
his political cartoons were featured in a variety of publications including whoopee , cheeky , jackpot , new society , the leveller , nme , time out , city limits , new statesman , private eye , and punch .
amongst his first comic strips was maggie 's farm which was published in time out magazine .
during these early days bell was already getting under the skin of the establishment - the maggie 's farm cartoons were condemned in the house of lords as " an almost obscene series of caricatures " .
in the nation 's eye steppin out on the third way legged race bell 's seminal cartoons drew interest from the guardian , and he joined the paper on a month 's trial in summer 1981 , developing a series of 24 strip cartoons for them .
so impressed was the guardian that steve was offered a permanent job .
his first if ¿ cartoon strip appeared in november 1981 and has proved to be hugely successful ever since .
steve 's arrival at the guardian was perfectly timed to capture key events in 1982 - the falklands war started soon after he joined the paper and he was able to capture the controversy surrounding the war with a caricaturist 's eye .
these cartoons also marked an early appearance of commander jack middletar and able seaman reg kipling , in the armoured punt hms incredible , one of bell 's most memorable images .
this was accompanied by early drawings of bell 's famous penguin , which has become a recurrent motif in his work down the years .

he depicted prime minister margaret thatcher as a psychotic woman , " a swivel-eyed heroine " .
during the 1990s bell captured the essence of prime minister john major , depicting him as a useless , superhero wearing his aertex underpants outside his trousers .
when tony blair became prime minister , bell openly admits that it took while to ' get him ' , but a trip to a labour party conference provided a revelatory moment .
bell spotted a strange psychotic glint in one of the prime minister 's eyes , redolent of margaret thatcher - and the ' blair eye ' became one of the cartoonist 's motifs .
capturing politics on paper steve bell 's work has published a large number of books of his work and has won numerous awards .
in 1993 he was the what the papers say cartoonist of the year and also scooped the political cartoon society cartoon of the year award in 2001 , the cartoonist of the year in 2005 , and the british press awards cartoonist of the year in 2002 .
steve has also won the cartoon arts trust award best strip cartoonist and / or best political cartoonist eight times .
as well his political caricatures , other popular bell cartoon characters include the old hack harry hardnose , lord god almighty , creator of heaven and earth , and the french monsieur l 'artiste , who some say is a caricature of bell .
steve bell remains one of britain 's most searing political cartoonists and continues to sharpen his political pencil in the guardian and his many publications .

"
i had a quick sniff ... and a quick gulp " john sweeney is also reporting for bbc two 's this world : vodka 's my poison wed 14 march 1900gmt , bbc two pskov is the end of the line .
i got off the moscow overnight express and the earth started to buckle in front of me .
on the pskov express i had played chess with a couple of russians , the vodka bottles had come out , and soon every move of a pawn was celebrated with a toast .
if you 're interested , i was about to win when the russian bloke nicked my queen - anyway , i had had enough to drink to kill a small horse .
there is something about the light - or the lack of it - that eats the soul in russia , that makes you drink .
the dark days in winter , the grimness of ordinary life .
they say one in six russians is an alcoholic .
that is why president putin , the former kgb man , is something of a puritan - at least in public .
he has brought in a series of laws , tripling the price of vodka and threatening dire penalties if people drink black market moonshine , which they call samogon .
and that is , of course , what everybody who ca n't afford shop-bought vodka does . "
across russia as a whole , officials have not counted , but some estimate 10,000 poison cases and 1,000 dead . "
they called it the yellow death .
it started in the summer when dozens of people turned up in casualty , a vile shade of yellow .
the dozens turned to hundreds , then a thousand .
the better cases recovered , but will die long before their time .
the worst cases ?
natasha is not yet 30 , she 's got a seven-year-old boy called maxim and she has less than a year to live .
her whole body has gone yellow - an instantly recognisable feature of toxic hepatitis .
something has destroyed her liver and now all the natural toxins in the body are stacking up .
her own body is poisoning her and there is nothing medicine - or at least nothing state medicine in russia - can do about it .
natasha and everyone else in the hospital corridors had bought samogon , moonshine , as usual - but something had been added to it .
clear liquid in pskov , the authorities have tracked more than 1,000 poisonings with 120 dead .
across russia as a whole , officials have not counted , but some estimate 10,000 poison cases and 1,000 dead .
so who is responsible for this mass poisoning ?
i had gone to pskov to try to get to the bottom of the yellow death .
we made friends with a gentlemanly russian , alexei , who was also an alcoholic , gave him a secret camera bag and sent him off to buy the samogon moonshine .
the plan was that we would then get it tested and analysed to see what the problem was .
he bought the stuff for 20 roubles -lrb- $ 0.80 , £ 0.40 -rrb- , a clear liquid in an old coke bottle .
i had a quick sniff .
the bouquet - rocket fuel with a touch of boot polish .
and a quick gulp .
in the film flash gordon , the heroine is given a slug of bright green alcohol so that she can bear to sleep with emperor ming the merciless .
it tasted something like that .
we filmed the local cops going round busting all the little people , the street traders in samogon .
the local chief of police in pskov , gen sergei matveyev - a plump bureaucrat with a fatter gold watch - was not keen to tell me what was the most likely source of the poison .
not many in authority give much of a damn about the nameless wretches of the earth : winos , moral degenerates .
the sense that many of the yellow people were ordinary russians who had been poisoned through no great fault of their own seemed to be missing .
medical disinfectant a doctor told me that the most likely cause was something which had been added to the moonshine - polyhexamethylene guanide hydrochloride .
and that stuff had got on the market as a medical disinfectant , extrasept .
it was 95 % pure alcohol and tax exempt - making it cheaper than moonshine .
dodgy traders had mixed the cheaper extrasept with the home-made samogon - and made a killing .
it was only once i had learnt about polyhexo that i got seriously worried about the samogon i had drunk .
it might have been contaminated too .
had i poisoned myself ?
was i going to turn yellow , too ?
we set off from pskov to st petersburg , to the institute of toxicology .
they had been feeding extrasept to rats .
the results were inconclusive .
i brought along a little bottle of the stuff i had drunk .
they tested it and they found no polyhexo , so i was clean .
the extrasept factory was a vast sprawling mess in alexandrov - a town associated with ivan the terrible .
the technical director said there was nothing wrong with his product - and he even drank some to prove it .
i asked him : " you 're not afraid of turning yellow , are you ? " .
later , when we got back to london , we had extrasept tested on human liver cells - and it killed every single one .
from our own correspondent was broadcast on saturday 10 march , 2007 at 1130 gmt on bbc radio 4 .

john sweeney will also be reporting on russia 's yellow death for this world on wednesday 14 march , 2007 at 1900 gmt on bbc two .

natasha is not yet 30 , she 's got a seven-year-old boy called maxim and she has less than a year to live .
her whole body has gone yellow - an instantly recognisable feature of toxic hepatitis .
something has destroyed her liver and now all the natural toxins in the body are stacking up .
her own body is poisoning her and there is nothing medicine - or at least nothing state medicine in russia - can do about it .
natasha and everyone else in the hospital corridors had bought samogon , moonshine , as usual - but something had been added to it .
clear liquid in pskov , the authorities have tracked more than 1,000 poisonings with 120 dead .
john sweeney wonders what the counterfeit alcohol contains across russia as a whole , officials have not counted , but some estimate 10,000 poison cases and 1,000 dead .
so who is responsible for this mass poisoning ?
i had gone to pskov to try to get to the bottom of the yellow death .
we made friends with a gentlemanly russian , alexei , who was also an alcoholic , gave him a secret camera bag and sent him off to buy the samogon moonshine .
the plan was that we would then get it tested and analysed to see what the problem was .
he bought the stuff for 20 roubles -lrb- $ 0.80 , £ 0.40 -rrb- , a clear liquid in an old coke bottle .
i had a quick sniff .
the bouquet - rocket fuel with a touch of boot polish .
and a quick gulp .
in the film flash gordon , the heroine is given a slug of bright green alcohol so that she can bear to sleep with emperor ming the merciless .
it tasted something like that .
we filmed the local cops going round busting all the little people , the street traders in samogon .
the local chief of police in pskov , gen sergei matveyev - a plump bureaucrat with a fatter gold watch - was not keen to tell me what was the most likely source of the poison .
not many in authority give much of a damn about the nameless wretches of the earth : winos , moral degenerates .
the sense that many of the yellow people were ordinary russians who had been poisoned through no great fault of their own seemed to be missing .
medical disinfectant a doctor told me that the most likely cause was something which had been added to the moonshine - polyhexamethylene guanide hydrochloride .
and that stuff had got on the market as a medical disinfectant , extrasept .
it was 95 % pure alcohol and tax exempt - making it cheaper than moonshine .
dodgy traders had mixed the cheaper extrasept with the home-made samogon - and made a killing .
it was only once i had learnt about polyhexo that i got seriously worried about the samogon i had drunk .
it might have been contaminated too .
had i poisoned myself ?
was i going to turn yellow , too ?
we set off from pskov to st petersburg , to the institute of toxicology .
they had been feeding extrasept to rats .
the results were inconclusive .
i brought along a little bottle of the stuff i had drunk .
they tested it and they found no polyhexo , so i was clean .
the extrasept factory was a vast sprawling mess in alexandrov - a town associated with ivan the terrible .
the technical director said there was nothing wrong with his product - and he even drank some to prove it .
i asked him : " you 're not afraid of turning yellow , are you ? " .
later , when we got back to london , we had extrasept tested on human liver cells - and it killed every single one .
