about a sixth of his 150-hectare -lrb- 370-acre -rrb- farm in the southern palatinate region of germany is currently dedicated to tobacco , the farm 's main source of income .

they may be suffering from laborophobia : the fear of work . it is likely there is not one among us who didn ’ t feign a stomach bug or attack of influenza to get out of going to school back in the day .

according to a berlin psychiatrist , not all of us got over the fear .
some out there swapped the angst for school for the angst for work .
these people , says michael linden , head of the psychiatric clinic at berlin 's freie university , are laborophobics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear of work can have very serious effects linden believes that the millions of people who are petrified of their jobs , terrified by their co-workers and who have nightmares about work may be suffering from a genuine medical disorder which doctors have overlooked until now .
far from being work-shy layabouts , these people could be suffering from an irrational fear of work .
what makes laborophobia a genuine work-related phobia rather than just an excuse ?
well , linden believes that it can occur in people who do not suffer from general anxiety disorders , making it unique in the field of phobias .
serious symptoms derived from a fear of work and far from eating specially constructed spicy dishes to bring on diarrhea , laborophobics have very real symptoms which would be enough to get you a whole year off school . " like other forms of anxiety , job anxieties can present in the form of panic , hypochondriac fears , work-related worrying , post-traumatic stress , or work-related social anxieties , " linden wrote in a paper on the phobia .
he says that workers who frequently call in sick or who complain of migraines stemming from their workload could in fact be laborophobic . " anxiety can lead to avoidance .
job anxiety can therefore be one explanation for sick leave , work absenteeism or early retirement , " he says .
paranoia strikes ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bullying is not always left at the school gates such people can also have a paranoid fear that they are being mobbed by co-workers or that their boss is intentionally burdening them with inhuman workloads and impossible deadlines .
they resort to alcohol or medication or seeking sick leave or early retirement .
" job anxieties , therefore , must be considered expensive problems , " warns linden , who is one of germany 's leading experts in chronic depression , phobias and psychosomatic rehabilitation treatments .
he estimates that as many as half of all workers on long-term sick leave may in fact show signs and symptoms of work-related anxiety .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 03.09.2007 experts : uk iraq pullout a prelude to chaos , strained relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that the departing british will leave basra to the gangs and militias british troops withdrew from their basra palace base for the relative safety of their main compound outside the city monday .
defense experts predict chaos and strained relations with the us once they leave iraq for good . after four-and-a-half years of inconclusive combat , british forces completed the last withdrawal of troops from the southern iraqi city of basra on monday .
the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .
there will be no winners , just more losers .
for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .
instead , it marks a refocusing of a small army onto a war that is winnable and more important than iraq .
" the british army is at its smallest since 1842 and is hugely overstretched , " he said .
" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .
many policy experts warn of more chaos ahead .
basra left to the gangs and militias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra has proven particularly hard to control the international crisis group , a think tank specializing in conflict issues , warned in june that the withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the shiite militias who have bombarded british bases daily and control much of the city 's economic and political life .
" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .
giles merritt said he believes that the british have every faith that iraqi forces can handle basra but that how the iraqis react to being in control is impossible to predict .
" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .
" however , the future of basra depends on the different loyalties of the iraqi army .
do they uphold the rule of law or remain loyal to whatever militia they are part of ? "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 03.09.2007 experts : uk iraq pullout a prelude to chaos , strained relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that the departing british will leave basra to the gangs and militias british troops withdrew from their basra palace base for the relative safety of their main compound outside the city monday .
defense experts predict chaos and strained relations with the us once they leave iraq for good . after four-and-a-half years of inconclusive combat , british forces completed the last withdrawal of troops from the southern iraqi city of basra on monday .
the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .
there will be no winners , just more losers .
for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .
instead , it marks a refocusing of a small army onto a war that is winnable and more important than iraq .
" the british army is at its smallest since 1842 and is hugely overstretched , " he said .
" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .
many policy experts warn of more chaos ahead .
basra left to the gangs and militias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra has proven particularly hard to control the international crisis group , a think tank specializing in conflict issues , warned in june that the withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the shiite militias who have bombarded british bases daily and control much of the city 's economic and political life .
" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .
giles merritt said he believes that the british have every faith that iraqi forces can handle basra but that how the iraqis react to being in control is impossible to predict .
" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .
" however , the future of basra depends on the different loyalties of the iraqi army .
do they uphold the rule of law or remain loyal to whatever militia they are part of ? "
tensions rise between coalition partners the pullout from basra and the eventual total withdrawal of british troops from iraq in the fall is likely to increase the pressure two-fold on the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 03.09.2007 experts : uk iraq pullout a prelude to chaos , strained relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that the departing british will leave basra to the gangs and militias british troops withdrew from their basra palace base for the relative safety of their main compound outside the city monday .
defense experts predict chaos and strained relations with the us once they leave iraq for good . after four-and-a-half years of inconclusive combat , british forces completed the last withdrawal of troops from the southern iraqi city of basra on monday .
the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .
there will be no winners , just more losers .
for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .
instead , it marks a refocusing of a small army onto a war that is winnable and more important than iraq .
" the british army is at its smallest since 1842 and is hugely overstretched , " he said .
" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .
many policy experts warn of more chaos ahead .
basra left to the gangs and militias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra has proven particularly hard to control the international crisis group , a think tank specializing in conflict issues , warned in june that the withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the shiite militias who have bombarded british bases daily and control much of the city 's economic and political life .
" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .
giles merritt said he believes that the british have every faith that iraqi forces can handle basra but that how the iraqis react to being in control is impossible to predict .
" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .
" however , the future of basra depends on the different loyalties of the iraqi army .
do they uphold the rule of law or remain loyal to whatever militia they are part of ? "
tensions rise between coalition partners the pullout from basra and the eventual total withdrawal of british troops from iraq in the fall is likely to increase the pressure two-fold on the united states .
the security situation is expected to worsen and if the pentagon makes good on its promise to intervene in southern iraq to quell any unrest in basra , us forces will become even more overstretched .
and , calls both at home and abroad for a complete us withdrawal from iraq will increase .
" the writing has been on the wall for a long time in the us , " merritt added .
" policy makers have been openly talking about running down the commitment and if basra erupts , then it 'll make life a lot harder for the us .
washington is already very concerned but if the south burns it 's hard to believe the us decision will be to send in more troops .
" the us would have much preferred to see the british pull out in six months to a year , " he continued .
" politically , there will be tensions over this especially if the british withdrawal causes major security and policy problems for the us . "
armies trading insults and blame the situation in basra and the decision of the british to begin a phased withdrawal from iraq has also caused rising tensions between the two armies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british blame rumsfeld for the post-invasion chaos general jack keane , a former vice chief-of-staff of the us army , said last month there was " frustration " in washington at the deteriorating security situation in the british-run area .
meanwhile retired major general tim cross , the top british officer involved in planning post-war iraq , hit back , saying he had raised serious concerns with then us defense secretary donald rumsfeld about the possibility of the country descending into chaos but rumsfeld had " ignored " or " dismissed " his warnings .
british general sir mike jackson also branded us post-invasion policy " intellectually bankrupt " and said rumsfeld was " one of the most responsible for the current situation in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 03.09.2007 german expert : soccer 's popularity explains death rate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statistically speaking , golf and bowling are more dangerous than soccer with the recent heart-attack deaths of two pro soccer players and the near-death of another , watchers of the sport are wondering : just how dangerous is soccer ?
dw-world.de spoke with world cup doctor wilfried kindermann . dw-world.de : professor kindermann , two soccer players died suddenly of heart attacks in recent weeks , and another was just barely saved .
is this coincidence - or is there something more going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindermann advises checkups for over-35s wilfried kindermann : above all , i think it is a coincidence .
the fact that soccer is the top sport worldwide adds to the chances : the more people there are playing the sport means there are that many more who can die of a heart attack while playing it .
in the usa , for example , many more athlete deaths take place during basketball and football games .
but if you look at injury and death relative to the number of people who play a given sport , then things look entirely different : relatively mild activities like bowling and golf are at the top of the roster when it comes to sport-related death . but the people who died last week were professionals ; young athletes who were even under medical supervision .
you would think they were particularly healthy , and unlikely to die of a heart attack . yes , there are people who appear healthy , but who either were n't examined at all , or who were n't examined well enough .
these sudden deaths are almost always due to some underlying illness .
in young athletes , for example , there is almost always inborn heart-muscle hypertrophy , malformed coronary arteries , or myocarditis . should the doctors who were supervising these players be accused of not keeping a close enough eye on their charges ? well , first you have to know whether they were examined at all .
hypertrophy can be easily diagnosed with an ultrasound .
in german soccer we have a very good system .
all players in the first and second german soccer leagues have a heart check before each season . everyone knows that doping is particularly damaging to the cardiovascular system .
can we rule out that the two players who died were involved in doping ? doping can , indeed , lead to heart damage - arhythmia , and sudden death from heart attack .
but it is really difficult to test for doping after someone 's death .
in most cases you can rule it out , but you ca n't always prove it after a death .
there were 15 deaths in competitive soccer in the last 10 years .
how many cases are we talking about worldwide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zambia 's chaswe nsofwa died suddenly during a practice session in israel that is an important question , because i would like to make it very clear that the numbers are really quite small .
we think there are some 100,000 sudden heart-attack deaths per year among people active in sports .
any sport that taxes the body is a danger - if the athlete is unhealthy .
if i start doing sports with an undiagnosed heart ailment , i am taking a risk . so if i want to go kick a ball around with my buddies after work tonight , i should go to the doctor first ? after a certain age , you should know about the state of your health .
right now we hold to the basic rule that anyone over 35 should have a checkup if they plan to do sports .
but i have to also make it clear that doing sports , per se , is healthy .
and people who are active have a smaller chance of dying of a heart attack than someone who is not .
in germany there are 100,000 sudden deaths from heart attack each year - and almost none of them have to do with sports . in the 1960s you were a competitive athlete .
were you examined back then ? oh , yes , i can remember it exactly .
i was a 400-meter runner and had to pedal a bicycle ergometer while lying down .
the doctor was surprised by my relatively weak performance .
wilfried kindermann , born in 1940 , was a member of the team that won the gold medal in the 4x 400-meter relay race in the european athletics championships in 1962 .
today he is one of the germany 's leading sports-medicine authorities .
he has been the chief physician of germany 's national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- for seven olympic games ; chief physician at fifa confederation cup 2005 and soccer world cup 2006 , a member of the medical committee of the european football association -lrb- uefa -rrb- ; deputy chairman of the german football association 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- commission on sports medicine ; internist for the german national football team 1990-2000 ; and member of the scientific advisory committee of the german heart association .

dw-world.de spoke with world cup doctor wilfried kindermann . dw-world.de : professor kindermann , two soccer players died suddenly of heart attacks in recent weeks , and another was just barely saved .
is this coincidence - or is there something more going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindermann advises checkups for over-35s wilfried kindermann : above all , i think it is a coincidence .
the fact that soccer is the top sport worldwide adds to the chances : the more people there are playing the sport means there are that many more who can die of a heart attack while playing it .
in the usa , for example , many more athlete deaths take place during basketball and football games .
but if you look at injury and death relative to the number of people who play a given sport , then things look entirely different : relatively mild activities like bowling and golf are at the top of the roster when it comes to sport-related death . but the people who died last week were professionals ; young athletes who were even under medical supervision .
you would think they were particularly healthy , and unlikely to die of a heart attack . yes , there are people who appear healthy , but who either were n't examined at all , or who were n't examined well enough .
these sudden deaths are almost always due to some underlying illness .
in young athletes , for example , there is almost always inborn heart-muscle hypertrophy , malformed coronary arteries , or myocarditis . should the doctors who were supervising these players be accused of not keeping a close enough eye on their charges ? well , first you have to know whether they were examined at all .
hypertrophy can be easily diagnosed with an ultrasound .
in german soccer we have a very good system .
all players in the first and second german soccer leagues have a heart check before each season . everyone knows that doping is particularly damaging to the cardiovascular system .
can we rule out that the two players who died were involved in doping ? doping can , indeed , lead to heart damage - arhythmia , and sudden death from heart attack .
but it is really difficult to test for doping after someone 's death .
in most cases you can rule it out , but you ca n't always prove it after a death .
there were 15 deaths in competitive soccer in the last 10 years .
how many cases are we talking about worldwide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zambia 's chaswe nsofwa died suddenly during a practice session in israel that is an important question , because i would like to make it very clear that the numbers are really quite small .
we think there are some 100,000 sudden heart-attack deaths per year among people active in sports .
any sport that taxes the body is a danger - if the athlete is unhealthy .
if i start doing sports with an undiagnosed heart ailment , i am taking a risk . so if i want to go kick a ball around with my buddies after work tonight , i should go to the doctor first ? after a certain age , you should know about the state of your health .
right now we hold to the basic rule that anyone over 35 should have a checkup if they plan to do sports .
but i have to also make it clear that doing sports , per se , is healthy .
and people who are active have a smaller chance of dying of a heart attack than someone who is not .
in germany there are 100,000 sudden deaths from heart attack each year - and almost none of them have to do with sports . in the 1960s you were a competitive athlete .
were you examined back then ? oh , yes , i can remember it exactly .
i was a 400-meter runner and had to pedal a bicycle ergometer while lying down .

gdf-suez will become one of europe 's biggest energy conglomerates . french president nicolas sarkozy brokered terms of the deal , which the companies ' boards agreed to late sunday .
the new company , called gdf-suez , will become one of europe 's largest energy conglomerates along with russia 's state-run gazprom , electricite de france and germany 's eon .
the two companies have a combined market value of 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122.8 billion -rrb- although suez will spin off many of its environmental assets , valued by analysts at 18-20 billion euros .
merger of equals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protected from foreign takeover the merger was first conceived 18 months ago , but was delayed by disagreements over valuation and control .
the final agreement will include a share exchange ratio of 0.9545 to 1 , or 21 gaz de france shares for 22 suez shares , the groups said in a joint statement .
sarkozy , who was elected in may and has promised economic reforms , pressured suez to abandon most of its water and waste assets to focus on energy .
besides distributing gas and electricity , suez runs power stations , pumps water and manages waste .
under terms of the deal , suez will divest 65 percent of its environmental activities through a stock market listing , scheduled to take place at the same time as the merger .
unions oppose privatization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big business sarkozy pushed for the merger to prevent a foreign takeover of suez and to strengthen gaz de france 's power assets .
the deal is the latest version of a plan first announced by former prime minister dominique de villepin in early 2006 to protect suez from a possible takeover by italy 's enel .
france 's unions and the socialists have opposed the merger because it would remove the government 's control over gaz de france .
the government owns 80 percent of gaz de france .
finance minister christine lagarde said the government will keep significantly more than a blocking minority of 35 percent .
the combined group will be led by suez chief executive officer gerard mestrallet with the state-owned gas utility 's jean-francois cirelli becoming the vice chairman .
the merged company has set a cost savings target of 1 billion euros by 2013 , according to bloomberg news service .
the transaction to create gdf suez will be completed " as early as possible " in 2008 , the companies said in a statement .
" recent developments in the energy sector reinforced the strategic and industrial logic behind the transaction , " which creates a " global energy leader , " the two companies said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karlsruhe university - one of only three elite universities in germany - has been holding a children 's university every summer for the past five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interactive experiments proved to be a favorite " it 's a good way to introduce children of that age to science and research , " explained organizer margarete lehne over the din of 300 children who were anxiously waiting for the start of a science lecture .

" complicated science as a gong sounded at the front of the lecture theater , the children gradually hushed to listen to professor norbert willenbacher , the head of karlsruhe university 's mechanics department .
willenbacher 's area of speciality is " rheology " - the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of applied stress .
it 's a complicated subject to teach to young children . " you have to avoid using scientific terms , and you have to talk a language which kids can understand , " willenbacher said .

he shows that liquids can have different viscosity by dropping eggs into beakers of water and oil and getting children to measure the rate of fall .
he gets kids to bang on sauce bottles to explain that even though tomato sauce is a fluid , it only acts like one if force is applied . best of all , dozens of children get to run across a bath filled with rice starch mixed to a pudding-like consistency .
when the children run fast , they stay on the surface .
when they go slowly , they sink into the oozing mass .
this demonstrates that plastic solids can have the properties of liquids under a heavy load .
willenbacher said it was lots of extra work to make his lecture kid-friendly , but it was worth it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children 's university proves science can be fun " i think it 's really part of scientists ' job , " he said .

she thought willenbacher 's lecture was " fantastic . " " the best thing about it was the experiments because they were fun , " she said .
" at school you always have to be careful , and information is just fed to you - they just tell you stuff .

" we are planning a new migration initiative , " eu commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told the web site of german newspaper die welt .
" the aim of this strategy is to stem illegal immigration , to encourage the flow of legal migrants and to remedy a lack of skilled labor in some eu economies . " aimed at certain migrants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : listening for change : benita ferrero-waldner the plan would set up so-called " mobility partnerships " that would allow people from outside the eu to enter legally , although they would only be able to stay for a specific period of time . at the same time - according to the labor needs of specific countries - they could get a work visa , ferrero-waldner said . the initiative is part of the eu 's 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- strong european neighborhood policy of mutual cooperation .
the enp is tailored to create a ring of peaceful and economically advanced states around the eu 's borders , and covers 16 countries , including ukraine , moldova , egypt , algeria , tunisia and israel . countries still have choice in the end , each eu country could choose how many immigrants it is willing to take in , and in which fields they should issue work visas , ferrero-waldner specified . but the new initiative is aimed at widening the scope of the eu 's free movement policy , where citizens in the 27-nation bloc can move between member states . by making it easier to get visas , the plan would increase demographic mobility , ferrero-waldner said . during the latest eu expansion , in 2004 , hundreds of thousands of workers from the 10 central and eastern european countries that joined the union headed to the old eu countries for work . germany seeks engineers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu expansion allowed more migration flexibilty countries like great britain , ireland and sweden opened up their labor markets from the beginning - with positive economic results , early studies show .

' this policy makes us all more secure ' while the enp is high on brussels ' political agenda , it has found less resonance among eu citizens .
a recent poll suggested 54 percent of europeans show little interest in what is happening outside the bloc 's borders , the eu observer reported .

with eu subsidies due to stop in 2009 , it 's predicted the crop will die out .
and given the current anti-smoking climate , there 's not a lot of sympathy for the farmers . farmer markus fischer is the fourth generation in his family to grow tobacco , and he 'll probably be the last .
about a sixth of his 150-hectare -lrb- 370-acre -rrb- farm in the southern palatinate region of germany is currently dedicated to tobacco , the farm 's main source of income .
but fischer is n't sure what the future holds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tobacco harvest is in full swing tobacco is a highly subsided crop in europe .
farmers earn around 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per kilo , and the eu pays about two euros per kilo on top of that . as part of the eu 's agricultural shake-up , these subsidies will be completely phased out by the end of 2009 , which will probably mean the end for germany 's 450 tobacco growers . " we ca n't cover our overheads without the subsidies , " fischer said . " for the amount we 're currently getting from the buyers , we wo n't be able to keep to producing . " examining other options like other farmers in the region , markus fischer and his family have already started looking into alternatives .
they have expanded their asparagus crop and started growing strawberries , although they will receive much less for these products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any extra income is welcome - the sign behind tobacco sheds advertises produce they have also built holiday houses on their land with the aim of establishing a farm-stay business .
fischer , however , still " hopes to keep growing tobacco , " because that is what he knows best . around 10,000 tons of virginia , burley and geudertheimer tobacco are harvested in germany , europe 's fifth biggest tobacco producer -lrb- italy sits in the number one spot -rrb- . most of germany 's tobacco farmers are based in the southwestern regions of baden and palatinate along the sunny rhine plain stretching from basel to mainz . more than 400 years of history tobacco has a long tradition in the palatinate .
the first recorded mention of the plant goes back to 1573 , when a priest started cultivating it as a medicinal herb .
now , approximately 1,200 hectares of tobacco are grown in the region - a third of germany 's total acreage dedicated to the crop . the plant has left an indelible mark on the area .
not only is the countryside dotted with tobacco fields and drying sheds , there are also frescos on houses depicting the harvest , tobacco sculptures , tobacco fountains , a tobacco museum and even a tobacco cycle path . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tobacco fountain in hexenheim is a reminder of the region 's heritage " if tobacco disappears , as it probably will if the situation does n't change , then we will also loose a part of our cultural tradition in the palatinate , " said jürg bähr , the head of the german tobacco grower 's association . the association is lobbying hard for an extension of the subsidies until 2013 so that the tobacco farmers have more time to convert to other crops . there 's no chance of the eu changing its payments scheme though - the subsidy cut was agreed and signed off on back in 2004 . the only chance for more money is from the federal government , but the current political climate is n't exactly supportive of tobacco . smoking bans federal bans on smoking in public transport , taxis , airports and government offices came into power in germany on sept .

the other states are expected to follow suit by the end of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco drying sheds are a common sight in the palatinate " we all know that smoking is bad for your health , and so of course politicians have a difficult time standing up for tobacco as a product , especially at the federal level , " bähr said . " but just because the growers are n't there anymore does n't mean people will smoke less . " europe already imports 95 percent of its tobacco from outside its borders .
according to bähr , when the european crop collapses , cigarette manufacturers will just import the extra 5 percent from elsewhere . " then people will be yelling again : ' the rain forest in brazil is being felled for tobacco , we ca n't have that , ' and ' children are being exploited in the fields working in africa and india , " ' he said .

with eu subsidies due to stop in 2009 , it 's predicted the crop will die out .
and given the current anti-smoking climate , there 's not a lot of sympathy for the farmers . farmer markus fischer is the fourth generation in his family to grow tobacco , and he 'll probably be the last .
about a sixth of his 150-hectare -lrb- 370-acre -rrb- farm in the southern palatinate region of germany is currently dedicated to tobacco , the farm 's main source of income .
but fischer is n't sure what the future holds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tobacco harvest is in full swing tobacco is a highly subsided crop in europe .
farmers earn around 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per kilo , and the eu pays about two euros per kilo on top of that . as part of the eu 's agricultural shake-up , these subsidies will be completely phased out by the end of 2009 , which will probably mean the end for germany 's 450 tobacco growers . " we ca n't cover our overheads without the subsidies , " fischer said . " for the amount we 're currently getting from the buyers , we wo n't be able to keep to producing . " examining other options like other farmers in the region , markus fischer and his family have already started looking into alternatives .
they have expanded their asparagus crop and started growing strawberries , although they will receive much less for these products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any extra income is welcome - the sign behind tobacco sheds advertises produce they have also built holiday houses on their land with the aim of establishing a farm-stay business .
fischer , however , still " hopes to keep growing tobacco , " because that is what he knows best . around 10,000 tons of virginia , burley and geudertheimer tobacco are harvested in germany , europe 's fifth biggest tobacco producer -lrb- italy sits in the number one spot -rrb- . most of germany 's tobacco farmers are based in the southwestern regions of baden and palatinate along the sunny rhine plain stretching from basel to mainz . more than 400 years of history tobacco has a long tradition in the palatinate .
the first recorded mention of the plant goes back to 1573 , when a priest started cultivating it as a medicinal herb .
now , approximately 1,200 hectares of tobacco are grown in the region - a third of germany 's total acreage dedicated to the crop . the plant has left an indelible mark on the area .
not only is the countryside dotted with tobacco fields and drying sheds , there are also frescos on houses depicting the harvest , tobacco sculptures , tobacco fountains , a tobacco museum and even a tobacco cycle path . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tobacco fountain in hexenheim is a reminder of the region 's heritage " if tobacco disappears , as it probably will if the situation does n't change , then we will also loose a part of our cultural tradition in the palatinate , " said jürg bähr , the head of the german tobacco grower 's association . the association is lobbying hard for an extension of the subsidies until 2013 so that the tobacco farmers have more time to convert to other crops . there 's no chance of the eu changing its payments scheme though - the subsidy cut was agreed and signed off on back in 2004 . the only chance for more money is from the federal government , but the current political climate is n't exactly supportive of tobacco . smoking bans federal bans on smoking in public transport , taxis , airports and government offices came into power in germany on sept .

karlsruhe university - one of only three elite universities in germany - has been holding a children 's university every summer for the past five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interactive experiments proved to be a favorite " it 's a good way to introduce children of that age to science and research , " explained organizer margarete lehne over the din of 300 children who were anxiously waiting for the start of a science lecture . " they 're naturally very curious and so we want encourage them to use this natural curiosity to find out how things work . " complicated science as a gong sounded at the front of the lecture theater , the children gradually hushed to listen to professor norbert willenbacher , the head of karlsruhe university 's mechanics department .
willenbacher 's area of speciality is " rheology " - the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of applied stress .
it 's a complicated subject to teach to young children . " you have to avoid using scientific terms , and you have to talk a language which kids can understand , " willenbacher said .
luckily , he has four children at home to keep him in line when it comes to explaining science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching kids about science is important to willenbacher " they 're always telling me : ' be short , be precise , and do n't make it too complicated . '
that 's what i hear all the time when i talk to them about my work and my research , " willenbacher said with a smile . hands-on activities willenbacher packs many experiments into his 45-minute talk .
he shows that liquids can have different viscosity by dropping eggs into beakers of water and oil and getting children to measure the rate of fall .
he gets kids to bang on sauce bottles to explain that even though tomato sauce is a fluid , it only acts like one if force is applied . best of all , dozens of children get to run across a bath filled with rice starch mixed to a pudding-like consistency .
when the children run fast , they stay on the surface .
when they go slowly , they sink into the oozing mass .
this demonstrates that plastic solids can have the properties of liquids under a heavy load .
willenbacher said it was lots of extra work to make his lecture kid-friendly , but it was worth it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children 's university proves science can be fun " i think it 's really part of scientists ' job , " he said .

she thought willenbacher 's lecture was " fantastic . " " the best thing about it was the experiments because they were fun , " she said .
" at school you always have to be careful , and information is just fed to you - they just tell you stuff .
but here they also did experiments . " according to the organizers , the only real complaints about the children 's university come from the adults who are miffed about having to wait outside .

karlsruhe university - one of only three elite universities in germany - has been holding a children 's university every summer for the past five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interactive experiments proved to be a favorite " it 's a good way to introduce children of that age to science and research , " explained organizer margarete lehne over the din of 300 children who were anxiously waiting for the start of a science lecture . " they 're naturally very curious and so we want encourage them to use this natural curiosity to find out how things work . " complicated science as a gong sounded at the front of the lecture theater , the children gradually hushed to listen to professor norbert willenbacher , the head of karlsruhe university 's mechanics department .
willenbacher 's area of speciality is " rheology " - the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of applied stress .
it 's a complicated subject to teach to young children . " you have to avoid using scientific terms , and you have to talk a language which kids can understand , " willenbacher said .
luckily , he has four children at home to keep him in line when it comes to explaining science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching kids about science is important to willenbacher " they 're always telling me : ' be short , be precise , and do n't make it too complicated . '
that 's what i hear all the time when i talk to them about my work and my research , " willenbacher said with a smile . hands-on activities willenbacher packs many experiments into his 45-minute talk .
he shows that liquids can have different viscosity by dropping eggs into beakers of water and oil and getting children to measure the rate of fall .
he gets kids to bang on sauce bottles to explain that even though tomato sauce is a fluid , it only acts like one if force is applied . best of all , dozens of children get to run across a bath filled with rice starch mixed to a pudding-like consistency .
when the children run fast , they stay on the surface .
when they go slowly , they sink into the oozing mass .
this demonstrates that plastic solids can have the properties of liquids under a heavy load .
willenbacher said it was lots of extra work to make his lecture kid-friendly , but it was worth it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children 's university proves science can be fun " i think it 's really part of scientists ' job , " he said .
" i am dedicated to science and i have fun with science , and i want to show this to the children . " popular program more than 5,000 children between the ages of five and 12 regularly come to the children 's university in karlsruhe , attending lectures on subjects ranging from electrical engineering to biology , meteorology , and architecture . eleven-year old theresa has been to all of the lectures offered at there this summer .
she thought willenbacher 's lecture was " fantastic . " " the best thing about it was the experiments because they were fun , " she said .
" at school you always have to be careful , and information is just fed to you - they just tell you stuff .
but here they also did experiments . " according to the organizers , the only real complaints about the children 's university come from the adults who are miffed about having to wait outside .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 03.09.2007 french companies merge to create new european energy giant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdf 's cirelli -lrb- left -rrb- and suez ' mestrallet are combining forces french president sarkozy has successfully negotiated the merger of paris-based suez group and state-controlled gaz de france , which was announced monday .
gdf-suez will become one of europe 's biggest energy conglomerates . french president nicolas sarkozy brokered terms of the deal , which the companies ' boards agreed to late sunday .
the new company , called gdf-suez , will become one of europe 's largest energy conglomerates along with russia 's state-run gazprom , electricite de france and germany 's eon .
the two companies have a combined market value of 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122.8 billion -rrb- although suez will spin off many of its environmental assets , valued by analysts at 18-20 billion euros .
merger of equals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protected from foreign takeover the merger was first conceived 18 months ago , but was delayed by disagreements over valuation and control .
the final agreement will include a share exchange ratio of 0.9545 to 1 , or 21 gaz de france shares for 22 suez shares , the groups said in a joint statement .
sarkozy , who was elected in may and has promised economic reforms , pressured suez to abandon most of its water and waste assets to focus on energy .
besides distributing gas and electricity , suez runs power stations , pumps water and manages waste .
under terms of the deal , suez will divest 65 percent of its environmental activities through a stock market listing , scheduled to take place at the same time as the merger .
unions oppose privatization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big business sarkozy pushed for the merger to prevent a foreign takeover of suez and to strengthen gaz de france 's power assets .
the deal is the latest version of a plan first announced by former prime minister dominique de villepin in early 2006 to protect suez from a possible takeover by italy 's enel .
france 's unions and the socialists have opposed the merger because it would remove the government 's control over gaz de france .
the government owns 80 percent of gaz de france .
finance minister christine lagarde said the government will keep significantly more than a blocking minority of 35 percent .
the combined group will be led by suez chief executive officer gerard mestrallet with the state-owned gas utility 's jean-francois cirelli becoming the vice chairman .

karlsruhe university - one of only three elite universities in germany - has been holding a children 's university every summer for the past five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interactive experiments proved to be a favorite " it 's a good way to introduce children of that age to science and research , " explained organizer margarete lehne over the din of 300 children who were anxiously waiting for the start of a science lecture .

" complicated science as a gong sounded at the front of the lecture theater , the children gradually hushed to listen to professor norbert willenbacher , the head of karlsruhe university 's mechanics department .
willenbacher 's area of speciality is " rheology " - the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of applied stress .
it 's a complicated subject to teach to young children . " you have to avoid using scientific terms , and you have to talk a language which kids can understand , " willenbacher said .

he shows that liquids can have different viscosity by dropping eggs into beakers of water and oil and getting children to measure the rate of fall .
he gets kids to bang on sauce bottles to explain that even though tomato sauce is a fluid , it only acts like one if force is applied . best of all , dozens of children get to run across a bath filled with rice starch mixed to a pudding-like consistency .
when the children run fast , they stay on the surface .
when they go slowly , they sink into the oozing mass .
this demonstrates that plastic solids can have the properties of liquids under a heavy load .
willenbacher said it was lots of extra work to make his lecture kid-friendly , but it was worth it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children 's university proves science can be fun " i think it 's really part of scientists ' job , " he said .

she thought willenbacher 's lecture was " fantastic . " " the best thing about it was the experiments because they were fun , " she said .
" at school you always have to be careful , and information is just fed to you - they just tell you stuff .

karlsruhe university - one of only three elite universities in germany - has been holding a children 's university every summer for the past five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interactive experiments proved to be a favorite " it 's a good way to introduce children of that age to science and research , " explained organizer margarete lehne over the din of 300 children who were anxiously waiting for the start of a science lecture . " they 're naturally very curious and so we want encourage them to use this natural curiosity to find out how things work . " complicated science as a gong sounded at the front of the lecture theater , the children gradually hushed to listen to professor norbert willenbacher , the head of karlsruhe university 's mechanics department .
willenbacher 's area of speciality is " rheology " - the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of applied stress .
it 's a complicated subject to teach to young children . " you have to avoid using scientific terms , and you have to talk a language which kids can understand , " willenbacher said .
luckily , he has four children at home to keep him in line when it comes to explaining science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching kids about science is important to willenbacher " they 're always telling me : ' be short , be precise , and do n't make it too complicated . '
that 's what i hear all the time when i talk to them about my work and my research , " willenbacher said with a smile . hands-on activities willenbacher packs many experiments into his 45-minute talk .
he shows that liquids can have different viscosity by dropping eggs into beakers of water and oil and getting children to measure the rate of fall .
he gets kids to bang on sauce bottles to explain that even though tomato sauce is a fluid , it only acts like one if force is applied . best of all , dozens of children get to run across a bath filled with rice starch mixed to a pudding-like consistency .
when the children run fast , they stay on the surface .
when they go slowly , they sink into the oozing mass .
this demonstrates that plastic solids can have the properties of liquids under a heavy load .
willenbacher said it was lots of extra work to make his lecture kid-friendly , but it was worth it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children 's university proves science can be fun " i think it 's really part of scientists ' job , " he said .
" i am dedicated to science and i have fun with science , and i want to show this to the children . " popular program more than 5,000 children between the ages of five and 12 regularly come to the children 's university in karlsruhe , attending lectures on subjects ranging from electrical engineering to biology , meteorology , and architecture . eleven-year old theresa has been to all of the lectures offered at there this summer .
she thought willenbacher 's lecture was " fantastic . " " the best thing about it was the experiments because they were fun , " she said .
" at school you always have to be careful , and information is just fed to you - they just tell you stuff .
but here they also did experiments . " according to the organizers , the only real complaints about the children 's university come from the adults who are miffed about having to wait outside .
no parents are allowed in the lecture room - it 's strictly a kids-only event ! kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about a sixth of his 150-hectare -lrb- 370-acre -rrb- farm in the southern palatinate region of germany is currently dedicated to tobacco , the farm 's main source of income .
but fischer is n't sure what the future holds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tobacco harvest is in full swing tobacco is a highly subsided crop in europe .
farmers earn around 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per kilo , and the eu pays about two euros per kilo on top of that . as part of the eu 's agricultural shake-up , these subsidies will be completely phased out by the end of 2009 , which will probably mean the end for germany 's 450 tobacco growers . " we ca n't cover our overheads without the subsidies , " fischer said . " for the amount we 're currently getting from the buyers , we wo n't be able to keep to producing . " examining other options like other farmers in the region , markus fischer and his family have already started looking into alternatives .

fischer , however , still " hopes to keep growing tobacco , " because that is what he knows best . around 10,000 tons of virginia , burley and geudertheimer tobacco are harvested in germany , europe 's fifth biggest tobacco producer -lrb- italy sits in the number one spot -rrb- . most of germany 's tobacco farmers are based in the southwestern regions of baden and palatinate along the sunny rhine plain stretching from basel to mainz . more than 400 years of history tobacco has a long tradition in the palatinate .
the first recorded mention of the plant goes back to 1573 , when a priest started cultivating it as a medicinal herb .
now , approximately 1,200 hectares of tobacco are grown in the region - a third of germany 's total acreage dedicated to the crop . the plant has left an indelible mark on the area .

with eu subsidies due to stop in 2009 , it 's predicted the crop will die out .
and given the current anti-smoking climate , there 's not a lot of sympathy for the farmers . farmer markus fischer is the fourth generation in his family to grow tobacco , and he 'll probably be the last .
about a sixth of his 150-hectare -lrb- 370-acre -rrb- farm in the southern palatinate region of germany is currently dedicated to tobacco , the farm 's main source of income .
but fischer is n't sure what the future holds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tobacco harvest is in full swing tobacco is a highly subsided crop in europe .
farmers earn around 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per kilo , and the eu pays about two euros per kilo on top of that . as part of the eu 's agricultural shake-up , these subsidies will be completely phased out by the end of 2009 , which will probably mean the end for germany 's 450 tobacco growers . " we ca n't cover our overheads without the subsidies , " fischer said . " for the amount we 're currently getting from the buyers , we wo n't be able to keep to producing . " examining other options like other farmers in the region , markus fischer and his family have already started looking into alternatives .
they have expanded their asparagus crop and started growing strawberries , although they will receive much less for these products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any extra income is welcome - the sign behind tobacco sheds advertises produce they have also built holiday houses on their land with the aim of establishing a farm-stay business .

gdf-suez will become one of europe 's biggest energy conglomerates . french president nicolas sarkozy brokered terms of the deal , which the companies ' boards agreed to late sunday .
the new company , called gdf-suez , will become one of europe 's largest energy conglomerates along with russia 's state-run gazprom , electricite de france and germany 's eon .
the two companies have a combined market value of 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122.8 billion -rrb- although suez will spin off many of its environmental assets , valued by analysts at 18-20 billion euros .
merger of equals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protected from foreign takeover the merger was first conceived 18 months ago , but was delayed by disagreements over valuation and control .
the final agreement will include a share exchange ratio of 0.9545 to 1 , or 21 gaz de france shares for 22 suez shares , the groups said in a joint statement .
sarkozy , who was elected in may and has promised economic reforms , pressured suez to abandon most of its water and waste assets to focus on energy .

france 's unions and the socialists have opposed the merger because it would remove the government 's control over gaz de france .
the government owns 80 percent of gaz de france .
finance minister christine lagarde said the government will keep significantly more than a blocking minority of 35 percent .
the combined group will be led by suez chief executive officer gerard mestrallet with the state-owned gas utility 's jean-francois cirelli becoming the vice chairman .

gdf-suez will become one of europe 's biggest energy conglomerates . french president nicolas sarkozy brokered terms of the deal , which the companies ' boards agreed to late sunday .
the new company , called gdf-suez , will become one of europe 's largest energy conglomerates along with russia 's state-run gazprom , electricite de france and germany 's eon .
the two companies have a combined market value of 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122.8 billion -rrb- although suez will spin off many of its environmental assets , valued by analysts at 18-20 billion euros .
merger of equals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protected from foreign takeover the merger was first conceived 18 months ago , but was delayed by disagreements over valuation and control .
the final agreement will include a share exchange ratio of 0.9545 to 1 , or 21 gaz de france shares for 22 suez shares , the groups said in a joint statement .
sarkozy , who was elected in may and has promised economic reforms , pressured suez to abandon most of its water and waste assets to focus on energy .
besides distributing gas and electricity , suez runs power stations , pumps water and manages waste .
under terms of the deal , suez will divest 65 percent of its environmental activities through a stock market listing , scheduled to take place at the same time as the merger .
unions oppose privatization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big business sarkozy pushed for the merger to prevent a foreign takeover of suez and to strengthen gaz de france 's power assets .
the deal is the latest version of a plan first announced by former prime minister dominique de villepin in early 2006 to protect suez from a possible takeover by italy 's enel .
france 's unions and the socialists have opposed the merger because it would remove the government 's control over gaz de france .
the government owns 80 percent of gaz de france .
finance minister christine lagarde said the government will keep significantly more than a blocking minority of 35 percent .
the combined group will be led by suez chief executive officer gerard mestrallet with the state-owned gas utility 's jean-francois cirelli becoming the vice chairman .
the merged company has set a cost savings target of 1 billion euros by 2013 , according to bloomberg news service .
the transaction to create gdf suez will be completed " as early as possible " in 2008 , the companies said in a statement .
" recent developments in the energy sector reinforced the strategic and industrial logic behind the transaction , " which creates a " global energy leader , " the two companies said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with world cup doctor wilfried kindermann . dw-world.de : professor kindermann , two soccer players died suddenly of heart attacks in recent weeks , and another was just barely saved .
is this coincidence - or is there something more going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindermann advises checkups for over-35s wilfried kindermann : above all , i think it is a coincidence .
the fact that soccer is the top sport worldwide adds to the chances : the more people there are playing the sport means there are that many more who can die of a heart attack while playing it .
in the usa , for example , many more athlete deaths take place during basketball and football games .
but if you look at injury and death relative to the number of people who play a given sport , then things look entirely different : relatively mild activities like bowling and golf are at the top of the roster when it comes to sport-related death . but the people who died last week were professionals ; young athletes who were even under medical supervision .
you would think they were particularly healthy , and unlikely to die of a heart attack . yes , there are people who appear healthy , but who either were n't examined at all , or who were n't examined well enough .
these sudden deaths are almost always due to some underlying illness .
in young athletes , for example , there is almost always inborn heart-muscle hypertrophy , malformed coronary arteries , or myocarditis . should the doctors who were supervising these players be accused of not keeping a close enough eye on their charges ? well , first you have to know whether they were examined at all .
hypertrophy can be easily diagnosed with an ultrasound .
in german soccer we have a very good system .
all players in the first and second german soccer leagues have a heart check before each season . everyone knows that doping is particularly damaging to the cardiovascular system .
can we rule out that the two players who died were involved in doping ? doping can , indeed , lead to heart damage - arhythmia , and sudden death from heart attack .
but it is really difficult to test for doping after someone 's death .
in most cases you can rule it out , but you ca n't always prove it after a death .
there were 15 deaths in competitive soccer in the last 10 years .
how many cases are we talking about worldwide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zambia 's chaswe nsofwa died suddenly during a practice session in israel that is an important question , because i would like to make it very clear that the numbers are really quite small .
we think there are some 100,000 sudden heart-attack deaths per year among people active in sports .
any sport that taxes the body is a danger - if the athlete is unhealthy .
if i start doing sports with an undiagnosed heart ailment , i am taking a risk . so if i want to go kick a ball around with my buddies after work tonight , i should go to the doctor first ? after a certain age , you should know about the state of your health .
right now we hold to the basic rule that anyone over 35 should have a checkup if they plan to do sports .
but i have to also make it clear that doing sports , per se , is healthy .
and people who are active have a smaller chance of dying of a heart attack than someone who is not .
in germany there are 100,000 sudden deaths from heart attack each year - and almost none of them have to do with sports . in the 1960s you were a competitive athlete .
were you examined back then ? oh , yes , i can remember it exactly .

but it is really difficult to test for doping after someone 's death .
in most cases you can rule it out , but you ca n't always prove it after a death .
there were 15 deaths in competitive soccer in the last 10 years .
how many cases are we talking about worldwide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zambia 's chaswe nsofwa died suddenly during a practice session in israel that is an important question , because i would like to make it very clear that the numbers are really quite small .
we think there are some 100,000 sudden heart-attack deaths per year among people active in sports .
any sport that taxes the body is a danger - if the athlete is unhealthy .
if i start doing sports with an undiagnosed heart ailment , i am taking a risk . so if i want to go kick a ball around with my buddies after work tonight , i should go to the doctor first ? after a certain age , you should know about the state of your health .
right now we hold to the basic rule that anyone over 35 should have a checkup if they plan to do sports .
but i have to also make it clear that doing sports , per se , is healthy .
and people who are active have a smaller chance of dying of a heart attack than someone who is not .
in germany there are 100,000 sudden deaths from heart attack each year - and almost none of them have to do with sports . in the 1960s you were a competitive athlete .
were you examined back then ? oh , yes , i can remember it exactly .
i was a 400-meter runner and had to pedal a bicycle ergometer while lying down .
the doctor was surprised by my relatively weak performance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 03.09.2007 german expert : soccer 's popularity explains death rate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statistically speaking , golf and bowling are more dangerous than soccer with the recent heart-attack deaths of two pro soccer players and the near-death of another , watchers of the sport are wondering : just how dangerous is soccer ?
dw-world.de spoke with world cup doctor wilfried kindermann . dw-world.de : professor kindermann , two soccer players died suddenly of heart attacks in recent weeks , and another was just barely saved .
is this coincidence - or is there something more going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindermann advises checkups for over-35s wilfried kindermann : above all , i think it is a coincidence .
the fact that soccer is the top sport worldwide adds to the chances : the more people there are playing the sport means there are that many more who can die of a heart attack while playing it .
in the usa , for example , many more athlete deaths take place during basketball and football games .
but if you look at injury and death relative to the number of people who play a given sport , then things look entirely different : relatively mild activities like bowling and golf are at the top of the roster when it comes to sport-related death . but the people who died last week were professionals ; young athletes who were even under medical supervision .
you would think they were particularly healthy , and unlikely to die of a heart attack . yes , there are people who appear healthy , but who either were n't examined at all , or who were n't examined well enough .
these sudden deaths are almost always due to some underlying illness .
in young athletes , for example , there is almost always inborn heart-muscle hypertrophy , malformed coronary arteries , or myocarditis . should the doctors who were supervising these players be accused of not keeping a close enough eye on their charges ? well , first you have to know whether they were examined at all .
hypertrophy can be easily diagnosed with an ultrasound .
in german soccer we have a very good system .
all players in the first and second german soccer leagues have a heart check before each season . everyone knows that doping is particularly damaging to the cardiovascular system .
can we rule out that the two players who died were involved in doping ? doping can , indeed , lead to heart damage - arhythmia , and sudden death from heart attack .
but it is really difficult to test for doping after someone 's death .
in most cases you can rule it out , but you ca n't always prove it after a death .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 03.09.2007 experts : uk iraq pullout a prelude to chaos , strained relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that the departing british will leave basra to the gangs and militias british troops withdrew from their basra palace base for the relative safety of their main compound outside the city monday .
defense experts predict chaos and strained relations with the us once they leave iraq for good . after four-and-a-half years of inconclusive combat , british forces completed the last withdrawal of troops from the southern iraqi city of basra on monday .
the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .
there will be no winners , just more losers .
for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .
instead , it marks a refocusing of a small army onto a war that is winnable and more important than iraq .
" the british army is at its smallest since 1842 and is hugely overstretched , " he said .
" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .
many policy experts warn of more chaos ahead .
basra left to the gangs and militias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra has proven particularly hard to control the international crisis group , a think tank specializing in conflict issues , warned in june that the withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the shiite militias who have bombarded british bases daily and control much of the city 's economic and political life .
" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .
giles merritt said he believes that the british have every faith that iraqi forces can handle basra but that how the iraqis react to being in control is impossible to predict .
" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .
" however , the future of basra depends on the different loyalties of the iraqi army .
do they uphold the rule of law or remain loyal to whatever militia they are part of ? "
tensions rise between coalition partners the pullout from basra and the eventual total withdrawal of british troops from iraq in the fall is likely to increase the pressure two-fold on the united states .
the security situation is expected to worsen and if the pentagon makes good on its promise to intervene in southern iraq to quell any unrest in basra , us forces will become even more overstretched .
and , calls both at home and abroad for a complete us withdrawal from iraq will increase .
" the writing has been on the wall for a long time in the us , " merritt added .
" policy makers have been openly talking about running down the commitment and if basra erupts , then it 'll make life a lot harder for the us .
washington is already very concerned but if the south burns it 's hard to believe the us decision will be to send in more troops .
" the us would have much preferred to see the british pull out in six months to a year , " he continued .
" politically , there will be tensions over this especially if the british withdrawal causes major security and policy problems for the us . "
armies trading insults and blame the situation in basra and the decision of the british to begin a phased withdrawal from iraq has also caused rising tensions between the two armies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british blame rumsfeld for the post-invasion chaos general jack keane , a former vice chief-of-staff of the us army , said last month there was " frustration " in washington at the deteriorating security situation in the british-run area .
meanwhile retired major general tim cross , the top british officer involved in planning post-war iraq , hit back , saying he had raised serious concerns with then us defense secretary donald rumsfeld about the possibility of the country descending into chaos but rumsfeld had " ignored " or " dismissed " his warnings .
british general sir mike jackson also branded us post-invasion policy " intellectually bankrupt " and said rumsfeld was " one of the most responsible for the current situation in iraq .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .
there will be no winners , just more losers .
for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .
instead , it marks a refocusing of a small army onto a war that is winnable and more important than iraq .
" the british army is at its smallest since 1842 and is hugely overstretched , " he said .
" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .
many policy experts warn of more chaos ahead .
basra left to the gangs and militias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra has proven particularly hard to control the international crisis group , a think tank specializing in conflict issues , warned in june that the withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the shiite militias who have bombarded british bases daily and control much of the city 's economic and political life .
" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .
giles merritt said he believes that the british have every faith that iraqi forces can handle basra but that how the iraqis react to being in control is impossible to predict .
" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .
" however , the future of basra depends on the different loyalties of the iraqi army .
do they uphold the rule of law or remain loyal to whatever militia they are part of ? "
tensions rise between coalition partners the pullout from basra and the eventual total withdrawal of british troops from iraq in the fall is likely to increase the pressure two-fold on the united states .
the security situation is expected to worsen and if the pentagon makes good on its promise to intervene in southern iraq to quell any unrest in basra , us forces will become even more overstretched .
and , calls both at home and abroad for a complete us withdrawal from iraq will increase .
" the writing has been on the wall for a long time in the us , " merritt added .
" policy makers have been openly talking about running down the commitment and if basra erupts , then it 'll make life a lot harder for the us .
washington is already very concerned but if the south burns it 's hard to believe the us decision will be to send in more troops .
" the us would have much preferred to see the british pull out in six months to a year , " he continued .
" politically , there will be tensions over this especially if the british withdrawal causes major security and policy problems for the us . "
armies trading insults and blame the situation in basra and the decision of the british to begin a phased withdrawal from iraq has also caused rising tensions between the two armies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british blame rumsfeld for the post-invasion chaos general jack keane , a former vice chief-of-staff of the us army , said last month there was " frustration " in washington at the deteriorating security situation in the british-run area .

they may be suffering from laborophobia : the fear of work . it is likely there is not one among us who didn ’ t feign a stomach bug or attack of influenza to get out of going to school back in the day .

according to a berlin psychiatrist , not all of us got over the fear .
some out there swapped the angst for school for the angst for work .
these people , says michael linden , head of the psychiatric clinic at berlin 's freie university , are laborophobics .

far from being work-shy layabouts , these people could be suffering from an irrational fear of work .
what makes laborophobia a genuine work-related phobia rather than just an excuse ?
well , linden believes that it can occur in people who do not suffer from general anxiety disorders , making it unique in the field of phobias .
serious symptoms derived from a fear of work and far from eating specially constructed spicy dishes to bring on diarrhea , laborophobics have very real symptoms which would be enough to get you a whole year off school . " like other forms of anxiety , job anxieties can present in the form of panic , hypochondriac fears , work-related worrying , post-traumatic stress , or work-related social anxieties , " linden wrote in a paper on the phobia .
he says that workers who frequently call in sick or who complain of migraines stemming from their workload could in fact be laborophobic . " anxiety can lead to avoidance .
job anxiety can therefore be one explanation for sick leave , work absenteeism or early retirement , " he says .
paranoia strikes ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bullying is not always left at the school gates such people can also have a paranoid fear that they are being mobbed by co-workers or that their boss is intentionally burdening them with inhuman workloads and impossible deadlines .
they resort to alcohol or medication or seeking sick leave or early retirement .
" job anxieties , therefore , must be considered expensive problems , " warns linden , who is one of germany 's leading experts in chronic depression , phobias and psychosomatic rehabilitation treatments .

they may be suffering from laborophobia : the fear of work . it is likely there is not one among us who didn ’ t feign a stomach bug or attack of influenza to get out of going to school back in the day .
those old tricks like putting the thermometer on the hot water bottle and rubbing soap on your chest used to work a treat when the fear of an math test or sports day got the better of us .
desperate times called for desperate measures .
how glad we all were when we grew up and never had to face choir practice or spelling bees again .
maturity brought this and other rewards .
school was behind us and we could joyfully enter the world of work - free of those gut-wrenching pangs that had us making fake vomit from custard and baked beans .
at least it was a relief for some .
according to a berlin psychiatrist , not all of us got over the fear .
some out there swapped the angst for school for the angst for work .
these people , says michael linden , head of the psychiatric clinic at berlin 's freie university , are laborophobics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear of work can have very serious effects linden believes that the millions of people who are petrified of their jobs , terrified by their co-workers and who have nightmares about work may be suffering from a genuine medical disorder which doctors have overlooked until now .
far from being work-shy layabouts , these people could be suffering from an irrational fear of work .
what makes laborophobia a genuine work-related phobia rather than just an excuse ?
well , linden believes that it can occur in people who do not suffer from general anxiety disorders , making it unique in the field of phobias .
serious symptoms derived from a fear of work and far from eating specially constructed spicy dishes to bring on diarrhea , laborophobics have very real symptoms which would be enough to get you a whole year off school . " like other forms of anxiety , job anxieties can present in the form of panic , hypochondriac fears , work-related worrying , post-traumatic stress , or work-related social anxieties , " linden wrote in a paper on the phobia .
he says that workers who frequently call in sick or who complain of migraines stemming from their workload could in fact be laborophobic . " anxiety can lead to avoidance .
job anxiety can therefore be one explanation for sick leave , work absenteeism or early retirement , " he says .
paranoia strikes ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bullying is not always left at the school gates such people can also have a paranoid fear that they are being mobbed by co-workers or that their boss is intentionally burdening them with inhuman workloads and impossible deadlines .
they resort to alcohol or medication or seeking sick leave or early retirement .
" job anxieties , therefore , must be considered expensive problems , " warns linden , who is one of germany 's leading experts in chronic depression , phobias and psychosomatic rehabilitation treatments .
he estimates that as many as half of all workers on long-term sick leave may in fact show signs and symptoms of work-related anxiety .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 03.09.2007 german expert : soccer 's popularity explains death rate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statistically speaking , golf and bowling are more dangerous than soccer with the recent heart-attack deaths of two pro soccer players and the near-death of another , watchers of the sport are wondering : just how dangerous is soccer ?
dw-world.de spoke with world cup doctor wilfried kindermann . dw-world.de : professor kindermann , two soccer players died suddenly of heart attacks in recent weeks , and another was just barely saved .
is this coincidence - or is there something more going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindermann advises checkups for over-35s wilfried kindermann : above all , i think it is a coincidence .
the fact that soccer is the top sport worldwide adds to the chances : the more people there are playing the sport means there are that many more who can die of a heart attack while playing it .
in the usa , for example , many more athlete deaths take place during basketball and football games .
but if you look at injury and death relative to the number of people who play a given sport , then things look entirely different : relatively mild activities like bowling and golf are at the top of the roster when it comes to sport-related death . but the people who died last week were professionals ; young athletes who were even under medical supervision .
you would think they were particularly healthy , and unlikely to die of a heart attack . yes , there are people who appear healthy , but who either were n't examined at all , or who were n't examined well enough .
these sudden deaths are almost always due to some underlying illness .
in young athletes , for example , there is almost always inborn heart-muscle hypertrophy , malformed coronary arteries , or myocarditis . should the doctors who were supervising these players be accused of not keeping a close enough eye on their charges ? well , first you have to know whether they were examined at all .
hypertrophy can be easily diagnosed with an ultrasound .
in german soccer we have a very good system .
all players in the first and second german soccer leagues have a heart check before each season . everyone knows that doping is particularly damaging to the cardiovascular system .
can we rule out that the two players who died were involved in doping ? doping can , indeed , lead to heart damage - arhythmia , and sudden death from heart attack .
but it is really difficult to test for doping after someone 's death .
in most cases you can rule it out , but you ca n't always prove it after a death .
there were 15 deaths in competitive soccer in the last 10 years .
how many cases are we talking about worldwide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zambia 's chaswe nsofwa died suddenly during a practice session in israel that is an important question , because i would like to make it very clear that the numbers are really quite small .
we think there are some 100,000 sudden heart-attack deaths per year among people active in sports .
any sport that taxes the body is a danger - if the athlete is unhealthy .
if i start doing sports with an undiagnosed heart ailment , i am taking a risk . so if i want to go kick a ball around with my buddies after work tonight , i should go to the doctor first ? after a certain age , you should know about the state of your health .
right now we hold to the basic rule that anyone over 35 should have a checkup if they plan to do sports .
but i have to also make it clear that doing sports , per se , is healthy .
and people who are active have a smaller chance of dying of a heart attack than someone who is not .
in germany there are 100,000 sudden deaths from heart attack each year - and almost none of them have to do with sports . in the 1960s you were a competitive athlete .
were you examined back then ? oh , yes , i can remember it exactly .
i was a 400-meter runner and had to pedal a bicycle ergometer while lying down .
the doctor was surprised by my relatively weak performance .
wilfried kindermann , born in 1940 , was a member of the team that won the gold medal in the 4x 400-meter relay race in the european athletics championships in 1962 .
today he is one of the germany 's leading sports-medicine authorities .
he has been the chief physician of germany 's national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- for seven olympic games ; chief physician at fifa confederation cup 2005 and soccer world cup 2006 , a member of the medical committee of the european football association -lrb- uefa -rrb- ; deputy chairman of the german football association 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- commission on sports medicine ; internist for the german national football team 1990-2000 ; and member of the scientific advisory committee of the german heart association .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 03.09.2007 experts : uk iraq pullout a prelude to chaos , strained relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that the departing british will leave basra to the gangs and militias british troops withdrew from their basra palace base for the relative safety of their main compound outside the city monday .
defense experts predict chaos and strained relations with the us once they leave iraq for good . after four-and-a-half years of inconclusive combat , british forces completed the last withdrawal of troops from the southern iraqi city of basra on monday .
the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .
there will be no winners , just more losers .
for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .
instead , it marks a refocusing of a small army onto a war that is winnable and more important than iraq .
" the british army is at its smallest since 1842 and is hugely overstretched , " he said .
" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .
many policy experts warn of more chaos ahead .
basra left to the gangs and militias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra has proven particularly hard to control the international crisis group , a think tank specializing in conflict issues , warned in june that the withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the shiite militias who have bombarded british bases daily and control much of the city 's economic and political life .
" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .
giles merritt said he believes that the british have every faith that iraqi forces can handle basra but that how the iraqis react to being in control is impossible to predict .
" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .
" however , the future of basra depends on the different loyalties of the iraqi army .
do they uphold the rule of law or remain loyal to whatever militia they are part of ? "
tensions rise between coalition partners the pullout from basra and the eventual total withdrawal of british troops from iraq in the fall is likely to increase the pressure two-fold on the united states .
the security situation is expected to worsen and if the pentagon makes good on its promise to intervene in southern iraq to quell any unrest in basra , us forces will become even more overstretched .
and , calls both at home and abroad for a complete us withdrawal from iraq will increase .
" the writing has been on the wall for a long time in the us , " merritt added .
" policy makers have been openly talking about running down the commitment and if basra erupts , then it 'll make life a lot harder for the us .
washington is already very concerned but if the south burns it 's hard to believe the us decision will be to send in more troops .
" the us would have much preferred to see the british pull out in six months to a year , " he continued .
" politically , there will be tensions over this especially if the british withdrawal causes major security and policy problems for the us . "
armies trading insults and blame the situation in basra and the decision of the british to begin a phased withdrawal from iraq has also caused rising tensions between the two armies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british blame rumsfeld for the post-invasion chaos general jack keane , a former vice chief-of-staff of the us army , said last month there was " frustration " in washington at the deteriorating security situation in the british-run area .
meanwhile retired major general tim cross , the top british officer involved in planning post-war iraq , hit back , saying he had raised serious concerns with then us defense secretary donald rumsfeld about the possibility of the country descending into chaos but rumsfeld had " ignored " or " dismissed " his warnings .
british general sir mike jackson also branded us post-invasion policy " intellectually bankrupt " and said rumsfeld was " one of the most responsible for the current situation in iraq .

the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .
there will be no winners , just more losers .
for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .
instead , it marks a refocusing of a small army onto a war that is winnable and more important than iraq .
" the british army is at its smallest since 1842 and is hugely overstretched , " he said .
" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .
many policy experts warn of more chaos ahead .
basra left to the gangs and militias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra has proven particularly hard to control the international crisis group , a think tank specializing in conflict issues , warned in june that the withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the shiite militias who have bombarded british bases daily and control much of the city 's economic and political life .
" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .
giles merritt said he believes that the british have every faith that iraqi forces can handle basra but that how the iraqis react to being in control is impossible to predict .
" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .
" however , the future of basra depends on the different loyalties of the iraqi army .
do they uphold the rule of law or remain loyal to whatever militia they are part of ? "
tensions rise between coalition partners the pullout from basra and the eventual total withdrawal of british troops from iraq in the fall is likely to increase the pressure two-fold on the united states .
the security situation is expected to worsen and if the pentagon makes good on its promise to intervene in southern iraq to quell any unrest in basra , us forces will become even more overstretched .
and , calls both at home and abroad for a complete us withdrawal from iraq will increase .
" the writing has been on the wall for a long time in the us , " merritt added .
" policy makers have been openly talking about running down the commitment and if basra erupts , then it 'll make life a lot harder for the us .
washington is already very concerned but if the south burns it 's hard to believe the us decision will be to send in more troops .
" the us would have much preferred to see the british pull out in six months to a year , " he continued .
" politically , there will be tensions over this especially if the british withdrawal causes major security and policy problems for the us . "
armies trading insults and blame the situation in basra and the decision of the british to begin a phased withdrawal from iraq has also caused rising tensions between the two armies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british blame rumsfeld for the post-invasion chaos general jack keane , a former vice chief-of-staff of the us army , said last month there was " frustration " in washington at the deteriorating security situation in the british-run area .
meanwhile retired major general tim cross , the top british officer involved in planning post-war iraq , hit back , saying he had raised serious concerns with then us defense secretary donald rumsfeld about the possibility of the country descending into chaos but rumsfeld had " ignored " or " dismissed " his warnings .
british general sir mike jackson also branded us post-invasion policy " intellectually bankrupt " and said rumsfeld was " one of the most responsible for the current situation in iraq .

karlsruhe university - one of only three elite universities in germany - has been holding a children 's university every summer for the past five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interactive experiments proved to be a favorite " it 's a good way to introduce children of that age to science and research , " explained organizer margarete lehne over the din of 300 children who were anxiously waiting for the start of a science lecture .

he shows that liquids can have different viscosity by dropping eggs into beakers of water and oil and getting children to measure the rate of fall .
he gets kids to bang on sauce bottles to explain that even though tomato sauce is a fluid , it only acts like one if force is applied . best of all , dozens of children get to run across a bath filled with rice starch mixed to a pudding-like consistency .
when the children run fast , they stay on the surface .
when they go slowly , they sink into the oozing mass .
this demonstrates that plastic solids can have the properties of liquids under a heavy load .
willenbacher said it was lots of extra work to make his lecture kid-friendly , but it was worth it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children 's university proves science can be fun " i think it 's really part of scientists ' job , " he said .

she thought willenbacher 's lecture was " fantastic . " " the best thing about it was the experiments because they were fun , " she said .
" at school you always have to be careful , and information is just fed to you - they just tell you stuff .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 03.09.2007 kids spellbound by university science lectures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children are eager to answer questions thousands of children in germany have been flocking to university science lectures during their summer holidays , and it 's not because they 're budding einsteins . the children 's university , which originated in 2002 at the university of tübingen , is designed to get young people interested in science . the idea has spread like wildfire and now more than 75 institutions across germany , as well as others in europe , have implemented their own lecture series for kids .
karlsruhe university - one of only three elite universities in germany - has been holding a children 's university every summer for the past five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interactive experiments proved to be a favorite " it 's a good way to introduce children of that age to science and research , " explained organizer margarete lehne over the din of 300 children who were anxiously waiting for the start of a science lecture . " they 're naturally very curious and so we want encourage them to use this natural curiosity to find out how things work . " complicated science as a gong sounded at the front of the lecture theater , the children gradually hushed to listen to professor norbert willenbacher , the head of karlsruhe university 's mechanics department .
willenbacher 's area of speciality is " rheology " - the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of applied stress .
it 's a complicated subject to teach to young children . " you have to avoid using scientific terms , and you have to talk a language which kids can understand , " willenbacher said .
luckily , he has four children at home to keep him in line when it comes to explaining science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching kids about science is important to willenbacher " they 're always telling me : ' be short , be precise , and do n't make it too complicated . '
that 's what i hear all the time when i talk to them about my work and my research , " willenbacher said with a smile . hands-on activities willenbacher packs many experiments into his 45-minute talk .
he shows that liquids can have different viscosity by dropping eggs into beakers of water and oil and getting children to measure the rate of fall .
he gets kids to bang on sauce bottles to explain that even though tomato sauce is a fluid , it only acts like one if force is applied . best of all , dozens of children get to run across a bath filled with rice starch mixed to a pudding-like consistency .
when the children run fast , they stay on the surface .
when they go slowly , they sink into the oozing mass .
this demonstrates that plastic solids can have the properties of liquids under a heavy load .
willenbacher said it was lots of extra work to make his lecture kid-friendly , but it was worth it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children 's university proves science can be fun " i think it 's really part of scientists ' job , " he said .
" i am dedicated to science and i have fun with science , and i want to show this to the children . " popular program more than 5,000 children between the ages of five and 12 regularly come to the children 's university in karlsruhe , attending lectures on subjects ranging from electrical engineering to biology , meteorology , and architecture . eleven-year old theresa has been to all of the lectures offered at there this summer .
she thought willenbacher 's lecture was " fantastic . " " the best thing about it was the experiments because they were fun , " she said .
" at school you always have to be careful , and information is just fed to you - they just tell you stuff .
but here they also did experiments . " according to the organizers , the only real complaints about the children 's university come from the adults who are miffed about having to wait outside .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 03.09.2007 german tobacco farmers face gloomy future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a sign that 's not well liked by tobacco growers germany 's tobacco growers are in crisis mode .
with eu subsidies due to stop in 2009 , it 's predicted the crop will die out .
and given the current anti-smoking climate , there 's not a lot of sympathy for the farmers . farmer markus fischer is the fourth generation in his family to grow tobacco , and he 'll probably be the last .
about a sixth of his 150-hectare -lrb- 370-acre -rrb- farm in the southern palatinate region of germany is currently dedicated to tobacco , the farm 's main source of income .
but fischer is n't sure what the future holds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tobacco harvest is in full swing tobacco is a highly subsided crop in europe .
farmers earn around 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per kilo , and the eu pays about two euros per kilo on top of that . as part of the eu 's agricultural shake-up , these subsidies will be completely phased out by the end of 2009 , which will probably mean the end for germany 's 450 tobacco growers . " we ca n't cover our overheads without the subsidies , " fischer said . " for the amount we 're currently getting from the buyers , we wo n't be able to keep to producing . " examining other options like other farmers in the region , markus fischer and his family have already started looking into alternatives .
they have expanded their asparagus crop and started growing strawberries , although they will receive much less for these products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any extra income is welcome - the sign behind tobacco sheds advertises produce they have also built holiday houses on their land with the aim of establishing a farm-stay business .
fischer , however , still " hopes to keep growing tobacco , " because that is what he knows best . around 10,000 tons of virginia , burley and geudertheimer tobacco are harvested in germany , europe 's fifth biggest tobacco producer -lrb- italy sits in the number one spot -rrb- . most of germany 's tobacco farmers are based in the southwestern regions of baden and palatinate along the sunny rhine plain stretching from basel to mainz . more than 400 years of history tobacco has a long tradition in the palatinate .
the first recorded mention of the plant goes back to 1573 , when a priest started cultivating it as a medicinal herb .
now , approximately 1,200 hectares of tobacco are grown in the region - a third of germany 's total acreage dedicated to the crop . the plant has left an indelible mark on the area .
not only is the countryside dotted with tobacco fields and drying sheds , there are also frescos on houses depicting the harvest , tobacco sculptures , tobacco fountains , a tobacco museum and even a tobacco cycle path . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tobacco fountain in hexenheim is a reminder of the region 's heritage " if tobacco disappears , as it probably will if the situation does n't change , then we will also loose a part of our cultural tradition in the palatinate , " said jürg bähr , the head of the german tobacco grower 's association . the association is lobbying hard for an extension of the subsidies until 2013 so that the tobacco farmers have more time to convert to other crops . there 's no chance of the eu changing its payments scheme though - the subsidy cut was agreed and signed off on back in 2004 . the only chance for more money is from the federal government , but the current political climate is n't exactly supportive of tobacco . smoking bans federal bans on smoking in public transport , taxis , airports and government offices came into power in germany on sept .
1 , while in august , three states introduced anti-smoking laws in schools , hospitals and most types of restaurants and bars .
the other states are expected to follow suit by the end of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco drying sheds are a common sight in the palatinate " we all know that smoking is bad for your health , and so of course politicians have a difficult time standing up for tobacco as a product , especially at the federal level , " bähr said . " but just because the growers are n't there anymore does n't mean people will smoke less . " europe already imports 95 percent of its tobacco from outside its borders .
according to bähr , when the european crop collapses , cigarette manufacturers will just import the extra 5 percent from elsewhere . " then people will be yelling again : ' the rain forest in brazil is being felled for tobacco , we ca n't have that , ' and ' children are being exploited in the fields working in africa and india , " ' he said . " we do n't have any of that here in germany . " kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with eu subsidies due to stop in 2009 , it 's predicted the crop will die out .
and given the current anti-smoking climate , there 's not a lot of sympathy for the farmers . farmer markus fischer is the fourth generation in his family to grow tobacco , and he 'll probably be the last .
about a sixth of his 150-hectare -lrb- 370-acre -rrb- farm in the southern palatinate region of germany is currently dedicated to tobacco , the farm 's main source of income .
but fischer is n't sure what the future holds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tobacco harvest is in full swing tobacco is a highly subsided crop in europe .
farmers earn around 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per kilo , and the eu pays about two euros per kilo on top of that . as part of the eu 's agricultural shake-up , these subsidies will be completely phased out by the end of 2009 , which will probably mean the end for germany 's 450 tobacco growers . " we ca n't cover our overheads without the subsidies , " fischer said . " for the amount we 're currently getting from the buyers , we wo n't be able to keep to producing .

the first recorded mention of the plant goes back to 1573 , when a priest started cultivating it as a medicinal herb .
now , approximately 1,200 hectares of tobacco are grown in the region - a third of germany 's total acreage dedicated to the crop . the plant has left an indelible mark on the area .

with eu subsidies due to stop in 2009 , it 's predicted the crop will die out .
and given the current anti-smoking climate , there 's not a lot of sympathy for the farmers . farmer markus fischer is the fourth generation in his family to grow tobacco , and he 'll probably be the last .
about a sixth of his 150-hectare -lrb- 370-acre -rrb- farm in the southern palatinate region of germany is currently dedicated to tobacco , the farm 's main source of income .
but fischer is n't sure what the future holds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tobacco harvest is in full swing tobacco is a highly subsided crop in europe .
farmers earn around 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per kilo , and the eu pays about two euros per kilo on top of that . as part of the eu 's agricultural shake-up , these subsidies will be completely phased out by the end of 2009 , which will probably mean the end for germany 's 450 tobacco growers . " we ca n't cover our overheads without the subsidies , " fischer said . " for the amount we 're currently getting from the buyers , we wo n't be able to keep to producing . " examining other options like other farmers in the region , markus fischer and his family have already started looking into alternatives .
they have expanded their asparagus crop and started growing strawberries , although they will receive much less for these products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any extra income is welcome - the sign behind tobacco sheds advertises produce they have also built holiday houses on their land with the aim of establishing a farm-stay business .
fischer , however , still " hopes to keep growing tobacco , " because that is what he knows best . around 10,000 tons of virginia , burley and geudertheimer tobacco are harvested in germany , europe 's fifth biggest tobacco producer -lrb- italy sits in the number one spot -rrb- . most of germany 's tobacco farmers are based in the southwestern regions of baden and palatinate along the sunny rhine plain stretching from basel to mainz . more than 400 years of history tobacco has a long tradition in the palatinate .
the first recorded mention of the plant goes back to 1573 , when a priest started cultivating it as a medicinal herb .
now , approximately 1,200 hectares of tobacco are grown in the region - a third of germany 's total acreage dedicated to the crop . the plant has left an indelible mark on the area .
not only is the countryside dotted with tobacco fields and drying sheds , there are also frescos on houses depicting the harvest , tobacco sculptures , tobacco fountains , a tobacco museum and even a tobacco cycle path . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tobacco fountain in hexenheim is a reminder of the region 's heritage " if tobacco disappears , as it probably will if the situation does n't change , then we will also loose a part of our cultural tradition in the palatinate , " said jürg bähr , the head of the german tobacco grower 's association . the association is lobbying hard for an extension of the subsidies until 2013 so that the tobacco farmers have more time to convert to other crops . there 's no chance of the eu changing its payments scheme though - the subsidy cut was agreed and signed off on back in 2004 . the only chance for more money is from the federal government , but the current political climate is n't exactly supportive of tobacco . smoking bans federal bans on smoking in public transport , taxis , airports and government offices came into power in germany on sept .
1 , while in august , three states introduced anti-smoking laws in schools , hospitals and most types of restaurants and bars .
the other states are expected to follow suit by the end of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco drying sheds are a common sight in the palatinate " we all know that smoking is bad for your health , and so of course politicians have a difficult time standing up for tobacco as a product , especially at the federal level , " bähr said . " but just because the growers are n't there anymore does n't mean people will smoke less . " europe already imports 95 percent of its tobacco from outside its borders .
according to bähr , when the european crop collapses , cigarette manufacturers will just import the extra 5 percent from elsewhere . " then people will be yelling again : ' the rain forest in brazil is being felled for tobacco , we ca n't have that , ' and ' children are being exploited in the fields working in africa and india , " ' he said . " we do n't have any of that here in germany . " kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" like other forms of anxiety , job anxieties can present in the form of panic , hypochondriac fears , work-related worrying , post-traumatic stress , or work-related social anxieties , " linden wrote in a paper on the phobia .
he says that workers who frequently call in sick or who complain of migraines stemming from their workload could in fact be laborophobic . " anxiety can lead to avoidance .

they resort to alcohol or medication or seeking sick leave or early retirement .
" job anxieties , therefore , must be considered expensive problems , " warns linden , who is one of germany 's leading experts in chronic depression , phobias and psychosomatic rehabilitation treatments .

they may be suffering from laborophobia : the fear of work . it is likely there is not one among us who didn ’ t feign a stomach bug or attack of influenza to get out of going to school back in the day .

at least it was a relief for some .
according to a berlin psychiatrist , not all of us got over the fear .
some out there swapped the angst for school for the angst for work .

far from being work-shy layabouts , these people could be suffering from an irrational fear of work .
what makes laborophobia a genuine work-related phobia rather than just an excuse ?
well , linden believes that it can occur in people who do not suffer from general anxiety disorders , making it unique in the field of phobias .
serious symptoms derived from a fear of work and far from eating specially constructed spicy dishes to bring on diarrhea , laborophobics have very real symptoms which would be enough to get you a whole year off school . " like other forms of anxiety , job anxieties can present in the form of panic , hypochondriac fears , work-related worrying , post-traumatic stress , or work-related social anxieties , " linden wrote in a paper on the phobia .
he says that workers who frequently call in sick or who complain of migraines stemming from their workload could in fact be laborophobic . " anxiety can lead to avoidance .
job anxiety can therefore be one explanation for sick leave , work absenteeism or early retirement , " he says .

they resort to alcohol or medication or seeking sick leave or early retirement .
" job anxieties , therefore , must be considered expensive problems , " warns linden , who is one of germany 's leading experts in chronic depression , phobias and psychosomatic rehabilitation treatments .

merger of equals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protected from foreign takeover the merger was first conceived 18 months ago , but was delayed by disagreements over valuation and control .
the final agreement will include a share exchange ratio of 0.9545 to 1 , or 21 gaz de france shares for 22 suez shares , the groups said in a joint statement .
sarkozy , who was elected in may and has promised economic reforms , pressured suez to abandon most of its water and waste assets to focus on energy .
besides distributing gas and electricity , suez runs power stations , pumps water and manages waste .
under terms of the deal , suez will divest 65 percent of its environmental activities through a stock market listing , scheduled to take place at the same time as the merger .
unions oppose privatization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big business sarkozy pushed for the merger to prevent a foreign takeover of suez and to strengthen gaz de france 's power assets .
the deal is the latest version of a plan first announced by former prime minister dominique de villepin in early 2006 to protect suez from a possible takeover by italy 's enel .
france 's unions and the socialists have opposed the merger because it would remove the government 's control over gaz de france .
the government owns 80 percent of gaz de france .
finance minister christine lagarde said the government will keep significantly more than a blocking minority of 35 percent .
the combined group will be led by suez chief executive officer gerard mestrallet with the state-owned gas utility 's jean-francois cirelli becoming the vice chairman .
the merged company has set a cost savings target of 1 billion euros by 2013 , according to bloomberg news service .
the transaction to create gdf suez will be completed " as early as possible " in 2008 , the companies said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 03.09.2007 german expert : soccer 's popularity explains death rate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statistically speaking , golf and bowling are more dangerous than soccer with the recent heart-attack deaths of two pro soccer players and the near-death of another , watchers of the sport are wondering : just how dangerous is soccer ?
dw-world.de spoke with world cup doctor wilfried kindermann . dw-world.de : professor kindermann , two soccer players died suddenly of heart attacks in recent weeks , and another was just barely saved .
is this coincidence - or is there something more going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindermann advises checkups for over-35s wilfried kindermann : above all , i think it is a coincidence .
the fact that soccer is the top sport worldwide adds to the chances : the more people there are playing the sport means there are that many more who can die of a heart attack while playing it .
in the usa , for example , many more athlete deaths take place during basketball and football games .
but if you look at injury and death relative to the number of people who play a given sport , then things look entirely different : relatively mild activities like bowling and golf are at the top of the roster when it comes to sport-related death . but the people who died last week were professionals ; young athletes who were even under medical supervision .
you would think they were particularly healthy , and unlikely to die of a heart attack . yes , there are people who appear healthy , but who either were n't examined at all , or who were n't examined well enough .
these sudden deaths are almost always due to some underlying illness .
in young athletes , for example , there is almost always inborn heart-muscle hypertrophy , malformed coronary arteries , or myocarditis . should the doctors who were supervising these players be accused of not keeping a close enough eye on their charges ? well , first you have to know whether they were examined at all .
hypertrophy can be easily diagnosed with an ultrasound .
in german soccer we have a very good system .
all players in the first and second german soccer leagues have a heart check before each season . everyone knows that doping is particularly damaging to the cardiovascular system .
can we rule out that the two players who died were involved in doping ? doping can , indeed , lead to heart damage - arhythmia , and sudden death from heart attack .
but it is really difficult to test for doping after someone 's death .
in most cases you can rule it out , but you ca n't always prove it after a death .
there were 15 deaths in competitive soccer in the last 10 years .
how many cases are we talking about worldwide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zambia 's chaswe nsofwa died suddenly during a practice session in israel that is an important question , because i would like to make it very clear that the numbers are really quite small .
we think there are some 100,000 sudden heart-attack deaths per year among people active in sports .
any sport that taxes the body is a danger - if the athlete is unhealthy .
if i start doing sports with an undiagnosed heart ailment , i am taking a risk . so if i want to go kick a ball around with my buddies after work tonight , i should go to the doctor first ? after a certain age , you should know about the state of your health .
right now we hold to the basic rule that anyone over 35 should have a checkup if they plan to do sports .
but i have to also make it clear that doing sports , per se , is healthy .
and people who are active have a smaller chance of dying of a heart attack than someone who is not .
in germany there are 100,000 sudden deaths from heart attack each year - and almost none of them have to do with sports . in the 1960s you were a competitive athlete .
were you examined back then ? oh , yes , i can remember it exactly .
i was a 400-meter runner and had to pedal a bicycle ergometer while lying down .
the doctor was surprised by my relatively weak performance .
wilfried kindermann , born in 1940 , was a member of the team that won the gold medal in the 4x 400-meter relay race in the european athletics championships in 1962 .
today he is one of the germany 's leading sports-medicine authorities .
he has been the chief physician of germany 's national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- for seven olympic games ; chief physician at fifa confederation cup 2005 and soccer world cup 2006 , a member of the medical committee of the european football association -lrb- uefa -rrb- ; deputy chairman of the german football association 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- commission on sports medicine ; internist for the german national football team 1990-2000 ; and member of the scientific advisory committee of the german heart association .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 03.09.2007 german expert : soccer 's popularity explains death rate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statistically speaking , golf and bowling are more dangerous than soccer with the recent heart-attack deaths of two pro soccer players and the near-death of another , watchers of the sport are wondering : just how dangerous is soccer ?
dw-world.de spoke with world cup doctor wilfried kindermann . dw-world.de : professor kindermann , two soccer players died suddenly of heart attacks in recent weeks , and another was just barely saved .
is this coincidence - or is there something more going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindermann advises checkups for over-35s wilfried kindermann : above all , i think it is a coincidence .
the fact that soccer is the top sport worldwide adds to the chances : the more people there are playing the sport means there are that many more who can die of a heart attack while playing it .
in the usa , for example , many more athlete deaths take place during basketball and football games .
but if you look at injury and death relative to the number of people who play a given sport , then things look entirely different : relatively mild activities like bowling and golf are at the top of the roster when it comes to sport-related death . but the people who died last week were professionals ; young athletes who were even under medical supervision .
you would think they were particularly healthy , and unlikely to die of a heart attack . yes , there are people who appear healthy , but who either were n't examined at all , or who were n't examined well enough .
these sudden deaths are almost always due to some underlying illness .
in young athletes , for example , there is almost always inborn heart-muscle hypertrophy , malformed coronary arteries , or myocarditis . should the doctors who were supervising these players be accused of not keeping a close enough eye on their charges ? well , first you have to know whether they were examined at all .
hypertrophy can be easily diagnosed with an ultrasound .
in german soccer we have a very good system .
all players in the first and second german soccer leagues have a heart check before each season . everyone knows that doping is particularly damaging to the cardiovascular system .
can we rule out that the two players who died were involved in doping ? doping can , indeed , lead to heart damage - arhythmia , and sudden death from heart attack .
but it is really difficult to test for doping after someone 's death .
in most cases you can rule it out , but you ca n't always prove it after a death .
there were 15 deaths in competitive soccer in the last 10 years .
how many cases are we talking about worldwide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zambia 's chaswe nsofwa died suddenly during a practice session in israel that is an important question , because i would like to make it very clear that the numbers are really quite small .
we think there are some 100,000 sudden heart-attack deaths per year among people active in sports .
any sport that taxes the body is a danger - if the athlete is unhealthy .
if i start doing sports with an undiagnosed heart ailment , i am taking a risk . so if i want to go kick a ball around with my buddies after work tonight , i should go to the doctor first ? after a certain age , you should know about the state of your health .
right now we hold to the basic rule that anyone over 35 should have a checkup if they plan to do sports .
but i have to also make it clear that doing sports , per se , is healthy .
and people who are active have a smaller chance of dying of a heart attack than someone who is not .
in germany there are 100,000 sudden deaths from heart attack each year - and almost none of them have to do with sports . in the 1960s you were a competitive athlete .
were you examined back then ? oh , yes , i can remember it exactly .
i was a 400-meter runner and had to pedal a bicycle ergometer while lying down .
the doctor was surprised by my relatively weak performance .
wilfried kindermann , born in 1940 , was a member of the team that won the gold medal in the 4x 400-meter relay race in the european athletics championships in 1962 .
today he is one of the germany 's leading sports-medicine authorities .
he has been the chief physician of germany 's national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- for seven olympic games ; chief physician at fifa confederation cup 2005 and soccer world cup 2006 , a member of the medical committee of the european football association -lrb- uefa -rrb- ; deputy chairman of the german football association 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- commission on sports medicine ; internist for the german national football team 1990-2000 ; and member of the scientific advisory committee of the german heart association .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 03.09.2007 german tobacco farmers face gloomy future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a sign that 's not well liked by tobacco growers germany 's tobacco growers are in crisis mode .
with eu subsidies due to stop in 2009 , it 's predicted the crop will die out .
and given the current anti-smoking climate , there 's not a lot of sympathy for the farmers . farmer markus fischer is the fourth generation in his family to grow tobacco , and he 'll probably be the last .
about a sixth of his 150-hectare -lrb- 370-acre -rrb- farm in the southern palatinate region of germany is currently dedicated to tobacco , the farm 's main source of income .
but fischer is n't sure what the future holds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tobacco harvest is in full swing tobacco is a highly subsided crop in europe .
farmers earn around 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per kilo , and the eu pays about two euros per kilo on top of that . as part of the eu 's agricultural shake-up , these subsidies will be completely phased out by the end of 2009 , which will probably mean the end for germany 's 450 tobacco growers . " we ca n't cover our overheads without the subsidies , " fischer said . " for the amount we 're currently getting from the buyers , we wo n't be able to keep to producing . " examining other options like other farmers in the region , markus fischer and his family have already started looking into alternatives .
they have expanded their asparagus crop and started growing strawberries , although they will receive much less for these products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any extra income is welcome - the sign behind tobacco sheds advertises produce they have also built holiday houses on their land with the aim of establishing a farm-stay business .
fischer , however , still " hopes to keep growing tobacco , " because that is what he knows best . around 10,000 tons of virginia , burley and geudertheimer tobacco are harvested in germany , europe 's fifth biggest tobacco producer -lrb- italy sits in the number one spot -rrb- . most of germany 's tobacco farmers are based in the southwestern regions of baden and palatinate along the sunny rhine plain stretching from basel to mainz . more than 400 years of history tobacco has a long tradition in the palatinate .
the first recorded mention of the plant goes back to 1573 , when a priest started cultivating it as a medicinal herb .
now , approximately 1,200 hectares of tobacco are grown in the region - a third of germany 's total acreage dedicated to the crop . the plant has left an indelible mark on the area .
not only is the countryside dotted with tobacco fields and drying sheds , there are also frescos on houses depicting the harvest , tobacco sculptures , tobacco fountains , a tobacco museum and even a tobacco cycle path . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tobacco fountain in hexenheim is a reminder of the region 's heritage " if tobacco disappears , as it probably will if the situation does n't change , then we will also loose a part of our cultural tradition in the palatinate , " said jürg bähr , the head of the german tobacco grower 's association . the association is lobbying hard for an extension of the subsidies until 2013 so that the tobacco farmers have more time to convert to other crops . there 's no chance of the eu changing its payments scheme though - the subsidy cut was agreed and signed off on back in 2004 . the only chance for more money is from the federal government , but the current political climate is n't exactly supportive of tobacco . smoking bans federal bans on smoking in public transport , taxis , airports and government offices came into power in germany on sept .
1 , while in august , three states introduced anti-smoking laws in schools , hospitals and most types of restaurants and bars .
the other states are expected to follow suit by the end of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco drying sheds are a common sight in the palatinate " we all know that smoking is bad for your health , and so of course politicians have a difficult time standing up for tobacco as a product , especially at the federal level , " bähr said . " but just because the growers are n't there anymore does n't mean people will smoke less . " europe already imports 95 percent of its tobacco from outside its borders .
according to bähr , when the european crop collapses , cigarette manufacturers will just import the extra 5 percent from elsewhere . " then people will be yelling again : ' the rain forest in brazil is being felled for tobacco , we ca n't have that , ' and ' children are being exploited in the fields working in africa and india , " ' he said .

" we are planning a new migration initiative , " eu commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told the web site of german newspaper die welt .
" the aim of this strategy is to stem illegal immigration , to encourage the flow of legal migrants and to remedy a lack of skilled labor in some eu economies . " aimed at certain migrants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : listening for change : benita ferrero-waldner the plan would set up so-called " mobility partnerships " that would allow people from outside the eu to enter legally , although they would only be able to stay for a specific period of time . at the same time - according to the labor needs of specific countries - they could get a work visa , ferrero-waldner said . the initiative is part of the eu 's 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- strong european neighborhood policy of mutual cooperation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 03.09.2007 experts : uk iraq pullout a prelude to chaos , strained relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that the departing british will leave basra to the gangs and militias british troops withdrew from their basra palace base for the relative safety of their main compound outside the city monday .
defense experts predict chaos and strained relations with the us once they leave iraq for good . after four-and-a-half years of inconclusive combat , british forces completed the last withdrawal of troops from the southern iraqi city of basra on monday .
the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .
there will be no winners , just more losers .
for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .
instead , it marks a refocusing of a small army onto a war that is winnable and more important than iraq .
" the british army is at its smallest since 1842 and is hugely overstretched , " he said .
" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .
many policy experts warn of more chaos ahead .
basra left to the gangs and militias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra has proven particularly hard to control the international crisis group , a think tank specializing in conflict issues , warned in june that the withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the shiite militias who have bombarded british bases daily and control much of the city 's economic and political life .
" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .
giles merritt said he believes that the british have every faith that iraqi forces can handle basra but that how the iraqis react to being in control is impossible to predict .
" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .
" however , the future of basra depends on the different loyalties of the iraqi army .
do they uphold the rule of law or remain loyal to whatever militia they are part of ? "
tensions rise between coalition partners the pullout from basra and the eventual total withdrawal of british troops from iraq in the fall is likely to increase the pressure two-fold on the united states .
the security situation is expected to worsen and if the pentagon makes good on its promise to intervene in southern iraq to quell any unrest in basra , us forces will become even more overstretched .
and , calls both at home and abroad for a complete us withdrawal from iraq will increase .
" the writing has been on the wall for a long time in the us , " merritt added .
" policy makers have been openly talking about running down the commitment and if basra erupts , then it 'll make life a lot harder for the us .
washington is already very concerned but if the south burns it 's hard to believe the us decision will be to send in more troops .
" the us would have much preferred to see the british pull out in six months to a year , " he continued .
" politically , there will be tensions over this especially if the british withdrawal causes major security and policy problems for the us . "
armies trading insults and blame the situation in basra and the decision of the british to begin a phased withdrawal from iraq has also caused rising tensions between the two armies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british blame rumsfeld for the post-invasion chaos general jack keane , a former vice chief-of-staff of the us army , said last month there was " frustration " in washington at the deteriorating security situation in the british-run area .
meanwhile retired major general tim cross , the top british officer involved in planning post-war iraq , hit back , saying he had raised serious concerns with then us defense secretary donald rumsfeld about the possibility of the country descending into chaos but rumsfeld had " ignored " or " dismissed " his warnings .
british general sir mike jackson also branded us post-invasion policy " intellectually bankrupt " and said rumsfeld was " one of the most responsible for the current situation in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 03.09.2007 experts : uk iraq pullout a prelude to chaos , strained relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that the departing british will leave basra to the gangs and militias british troops withdrew from their basra palace base for the relative safety of their main compound outside the city monday .
defense experts predict chaos and strained relations with the us once they leave iraq for good . after four-and-a-half years of inconclusive combat , british forces completed the last withdrawal of troops from the southern iraqi city of basra on monday .
the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .
there will be no winners , just more losers .
for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .
instead , it marks a refocusing of a small army onto a war that is winnable and more important than iraq .
" the british army is at its smallest since 1842 and is hugely overstretched , " he said .
" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .
many policy experts warn of more chaos ahead .
basra left to the gangs and militias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra has proven particularly hard to control the international crisis group , a think tank specializing in conflict issues , warned in june that the withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the shiite militias who have bombarded british bases daily and control much of the city 's economic and political life .
" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .
giles merritt said he believes that the british have every faith that iraqi forces can handle basra but that how the iraqis react to being in control is impossible to predict .
" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .
" however , the future of basra depends on the different loyalties of the iraqi army .
do they uphold the rule of law or remain loyal to whatever militia they are part of ? "
tensions rise between coalition partners the pullout from basra and the eventual total withdrawal of british troops from iraq in the fall is likely to increase the pressure two-fold on the united states .
the security situation is expected to worsen and if the pentagon makes good on its promise to intervene in southern iraq to quell any unrest in basra , us forces will become even more overstretched .
and , calls both at home and abroad for a complete us withdrawal from iraq will increase .
" the writing has been on the wall for a long time in the us , " merritt added .
" policy makers have been openly talking about running down the commitment and if basra erupts , then it 'll make life a lot harder for the us .
washington is already very concerned but if the south burns it 's hard to believe the us decision will be to send in more troops .
" the us would have much preferred to see the british pull out in six months to a year , " he continued .
" politically , there will be tensions over this especially if the british withdrawal causes major security and policy problems for the us . "
armies trading insults and blame the situation in basra and the decision of the british to begin a phased withdrawal from iraq has also caused rising tensions between the two armies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british blame rumsfeld for the post-invasion chaos general jack keane , a former vice chief-of-staff of the us army , said last month there was " frustration " in washington at the deteriorating security situation in the british-run area .
meanwhile retired major general tim cross , the top british officer involved in planning post-war iraq , hit back , saying he had raised serious concerns with then us defense secretary donald rumsfeld about the possibility of the country descending into chaos but rumsfeld had " ignored " or " dismissed " his warnings .

they may be suffering from laborophobia : the fear of work . it is likely there is not one among us who didn ’ t feign a stomach bug or attack of influenza to get out of going to school back in the day .
those old tricks like putting the thermometer on the hot water bottle and rubbing soap on your chest used to work a treat when the fear of an math test or sports day got the better of us .
desperate times called for desperate measures .
how glad we all were when we grew up and never had to face choir practice or spelling bees again .
maturity brought this and other rewards .
school was behind us and we could joyfully enter the world of work - free of those gut-wrenching pangs that had us making fake vomit from custard and baked beans .
at least it was a relief for some .
according to a berlin psychiatrist , not all of us got over the fear .
some out there swapped the angst for school for the angst for work .
these people , says michael linden , head of the psychiatric clinic at berlin 's freie university , are laborophobics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear of work can have very serious effects linden believes that the millions of people who are petrified of their jobs , terrified by their co-workers and who have nightmares about work may be suffering from a genuine medical disorder which doctors have overlooked until now .
far from being work-shy layabouts , these people could be suffering from an irrational fear of work .
what makes laborophobia a genuine work-related phobia rather than just an excuse ?
well , linden believes that it can occur in people who do not suffer from general anxiety disorders , making it unique in the field of phobias .
serious symptoms derived from a fear of work and far from eating specially constructed spicy dishes to bring on diarrhea , laborophobics have very real symptoms which would be enough to get you a whole year off school . " like other forms of anxiety , job anxieties can present in the form of panic , hypochondriac fears , work-related worrying , post-traumatic stress , or work-related social anxieties , " linden wrote in a paper on the phobia .
he says that workers who frequently call in sick or who complain of migraines stemming from their workload could in fact be laborophobic . " anxiety can lead to avoidance .
job anxiety can therefore be one explanation for sick leave , work absenteeism or early retirement , " he says .
paranoia strikes ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bullying is not always left at the school gates such people can also have a paranoid fear that they are being mobbed by co-workers or that their boss is intentionally burdening them with inhuman workloads and impossible deadlines .
they resort to alcohol or medication or seeking sick leave or early retirement .
" job anxieties , therefore , must be considered expensive problems , " warns linden , who is one of germany 's leading experts in chronic depression , phobias and psychosomatic rehabilitation treatments .
he estimates that as many as half of all workers on long-term sick leave may in fact show signs and symptoms of work-related anxiety .
the others might just be very good at puking on demand . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they may be suffering from laborophobia : the fear of work . it is likely there is not one among us who didn ’ t feign a stomach bug or attack of influenza to get out of going to school back in the day .
those old tricks like putting the thermometer on the hot water bottle and rubbing soap on your chest used to work a treat when the fear of an math test or sports day got the better of us .
desperate times called for desperate measures .
how glad we all were when we grew up and never had to face choir practice or spelling bees again .
maturity brought this and other rewards .
school was behind us and we could joyfully enter the world of work - free of those gut-wrenching pangs that had us making fake vomit from custard and baked beans .
at least it was a relief for some .
according to a berlin psychiatrist , not all of us got over the fear .
some out there swapped the angst for school for the angst for work .
these people , says michael linden , head of the psychiatric clinic at berlin 's freie university , are laborophobics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear of work can have very serious effects linden believes that the millions of people who are petrified of their jobs , terrified by their co-workers and who have nightmares about work may be suffering from a genuine medical disorder which doctors have overlooked until now .
far from being work-shy layabouts , these people could be suffering from an irrational fear of work .
what makes laborophobia a genuine work-related phobia rather than just an excuse ?
well , linden believes that it can occur in people who do not suffer from general anxiety disorders , making it unique in the field of phobias .
serious symptoms derived from a fear of work and far from eating specially constructed spicy dishes to bring on diarrhea , laborophobics have very real symptoms which would be enough to get you a whole year off school . " like other forms of anxiety , job anxieties can present in the form of panic , hypochondriac fears , work-related worrying , post-traumatic stress , or work-related social anxieties , " linden wrote in a paper on the phobia .
he says that workers who frequently call in sick or who complain of migraines stemming from their workload could in fact be laborophobic . " anxiety can lead to avoidance .
job anxiety can therefore be one explanation for sick leave , work absenteeism or early retirement , " he says .
paranoia strikes ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bullying is not always left at the school gates such people can also have a paranoid fear that they are being mobbed by co-workers or that their boss is intentionally burdening them with inhuman workloads and impossible deadlines .
they resort to alcohol or medication or seeking sick leave or early retirement .
" job anxieties , therefore , must be considered expensive problems , " warns linden , who is one of germany 's leading experts in chronic depression , phobias and psychosomatic rehabilitation treatments .
he estimates that as many as half of all workers on long-term sick leave may in fact show signs and symptoms of work-related anxiety .
the others might just be very good at puking on demand . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gdf-suez will become one of europe 's biggest energy conglomerates . french president nicolas sarkozy brokered terms of the deal , which the companies ' boards agreed to late sunday .
the new company , called gdf-suez , will become one of europe 's largest energy conglomerates along with russia 's state-run gazprom , electricite de france and germany 's eon .
the two companies have a combined market value of 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122.8 billion -rrb- although suez will spin off many of its environmental assets , valued by analysts at 18-20 billion euros .
merger of equals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protected from foreign takeover the merger was first conceived 18 months ago , but was delayed by disagreements over valuation and control .
the final agreement will include a share exchange ratio of 0.9545 to 1 , or 21 gaz de france shares for 22 suez shares , the groups said in a joint statement .
sarkozy , who was elected in may and has promised economic reforms , pressured suez to abandon most of its water and waste assets to focus on energy .
besides distributing gas and electricity , suez runs power stations , pumps water and manages waste .
under terms of the deal , suez will divest 65 percent of its environmental activities through a stock market listing , scheduled to take place at the same time as the merger .

france 's unions and the socialists have opposed the merger because it would remove the government 's control over gaz de france .
the government owns 80 percent of gaz de france .
finance minister christine lagarde said the government will keep significantly more than a blocking minority of 35 percent .
the combined group will be led by suez chief executive officer gerard mestrallet with the state-owned gas utility 's jean-francois cirelli becoming the vice chairman .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 03.09.2007 experts : uk iraq pullout a prelude to chaos , strained relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that the departing british will leave basra to the gangs and militias british troops withdrew from their basra palace base for the relative safety of their main compound outside the city monday .
defense experts predict chaos and strained relations with the us once they leave iraq for good . after four-and-a-half years of inconclusive combat , british forces completed the last withdrawal of troops from the southern iraqi city of basra on monday .
the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .
there will be no winners , just more losers .
for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .
instead , it marks a refocusing of a small army onto a war that is winnable and more important than iraq .
" the british army is at its smallest since 1842 and is hugely overstretched , " he said .
" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .
many policy experts warn of more chaos ahead .
basra left to the gangs and militias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra has proven particularly hard to control the international crisis group , a think tank specializing in conflict issues , warned in june that the withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the shiite militias who have bombarded british bases daily and control much of the city 's economic and political life .
" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .
giles merritt said he believes that the british have every faith that iraqi forces can handle basra but that how the iraqis react to being in control is impossible to predict .
" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .
" however , the future of basra depends on the different loyalties of the iraqi army .
do they uphold the rule of law or remain loyal to whatever militia they are part of ? "
tensions rise between coalition partners the pullout from basra and the eventual total withdrawal of british troops from iraq in the fall is likely to increase the pressure two-fold on the united states .
the security situation is expected to worsen and if the pentagon makes good on its promise to intervene in southern iraq to quell any unrest in basra , us forces will become even more overstretched .
and , calls both at home and abroad for a complete us withdrawal from iraq will increase .
" the writing has been on the wall for a long time in the us , " merritt added .
" policy makers have been openly talking about running down the commitment and if basra erupts , then it 'll make life a lot harder for the us .
washington is already very concerned but if the south burns it 's hard to believe the us decision will be to send in more troops .
" the us would have much preferred to see the british pull out in six months to a year , " he continued .

defense experts predict chaos and strained relations with the us once they leave iraq for good . after four-and-a-half years of inconclusive combat , british forces completed the last withdrawal of troops from the southern iraqi city of basra on monday .
the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .
there will be no winners , just more losers .
for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .
instead , it marks a refocusing of a small army onto a war that is winnable and more important than iraq .
" the british army is at its smallest since 1842 and is hugely overstretched , " he said .
" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .
many policy experts warn of more chaos ahead .
basra left to the gangs and militias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra has proven particularly hard to control the international crisis group , a think tank specializing in conflict issues , warned in june that the withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the shiite militias who have bombarded british bases daily and control much of the city 's economic and political life .
" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .
giles merritt said he believes that the british have every faith that iraqi forces can handle basra but that how the iraqis react to being in control is impossible to predict .
" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .
" however , the future of basra depends on the different loyalties of the iraqi army .
do they uphold the rule of law or remain loyal to whatever militia they are part of ? "
tensions rise between coalition partners the pullout from basra and the eventual total withdrawal of british troops from iraq in the fall is likely to increase the pressure two-fold on the united states .
the security situation is expected to worsen and if the pentagon makes good on its promise to intervene in southern iraq to quell any unrest in basra , us forces will become even more overstretched .
and , calls both at home and abroad for a complete us withdrawal from iraq will increase .
" the writing has been on the wall for a long time in the us , " merritt added .
" policy makers have been openly talking about running down the commitment and if basra erupts , then it 'll make life a lot harder for the us .
washington is already very concerned but if the south burns it 's hard to believe the us decision will be to send in more troops .
" the us would have much preferred to see the british pull out in six months to a year , " he continued .
" politically , there will be tensions over this especially if the british withdrawal causes major security and policy problems for the us . "
armies trading insults and blame the situation in basra and the decision of the british to begin a phased withdrawal from iraq has also caused rising tensions between the two armies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 03.09.2007 german tobacco farmers face gloomy future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a sign that 's not well liked by tobacco growers germany 's tobacco growers are in crisis mode .
with eu subsidies due to stop in 2009 , it 's predicted the crop will die out .
and given the current anti-smoking climate , there 's not a lot of sympathy for the farmers . farmer markus fischer is the fourth generation in his family to grow tobacco , and he 'll probably be the last .
about a sixth of his 150-hectare -lrb- 370-acre -rrb- farm in the southern palatinate region of germany is currently dedicated to tobacco , the farm 's main source of income .
but fischer is n't sure what the future holds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tobacco harvest is in full swing tobacco is a highly subsided crop in europe .
farmers earn around 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per kilo , and the eu pays about two euros per kilo on top of that . as part of the eu 's agricultural shake-up , these subsidies will be completely phased out by the end of 2009 , which will probably mean the end for germany 's 450 tobacco growers . " we ca n't cover our overheads without the subsidies , " fischer said . " for the amount we 're currently getting from the buyers , we wo n't be able to keep to producing . " examining other options like other farmers in the region , markus fischer and his family have already started looking into alternatives .
they have expanded their asparagus crop and started growing strawberries , although they will receive much less for these products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any extra income is welcome - the sign behind tobacco sheds advertises produce they have also built holiday houses on their land with the aim of establishing a farm-stay business .
fischer , however , still " hopes to keep growing tobacco , " because that is what he knows best . around 10,000 tons of virginia , burley and geudertheimer tobacco are harvested in germany , europe 's fifth biggest tobacco producer -lrb- italy sits in the number one spot -rrb- . most of germany 's tobacco farmers are based in the southwestern regions of baden and palatinate along the sunny rhine plain stretching from basel to mainz . more than 400 years of history tobacco has a long tradition in the palatinate .
the first recorded mention of the plant goes back to 1573 , when a priest started cultivating it as a medicinal herb .
now , approximately 1,200 hectares of tobacco are grown in the region - a third of germany 's total acreage dedicated to the crop . the plant has left an indelible mark on the area .
not only is the countryside dotted with tobacco fields and drying sheds , there are also frescos on houses depicting the harvest , tobacco sculptures , tobacco fountains , a tobacco museum and even a tobacco cycle path . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tobacco fountain in hexenheim is a reminder of the region 's heritage " if tobacco disappears , as it probably will if the situation does n't change , then we will also loose a part of our cultural tradition in the palatinate , " said jürg bähr , the head of the german tobacco grower 's association . the association is lobbying hard for an extension of the subsidies until 2013 so that the tobacco farmers have more time to convert to other crops . there 's no chance of the eu changing its payments scheme though - the subsidy cut was agreed and signed off on back in 2004 . the only chance for more money is from the federal government , but the current political climate is n't exactly supportive of tobacco . smoking bans federal bans on smoking in public transport , taxis , airports and government offices came into power in germany on sept .
1 , while in august , three states introduced anti-smoking laws in schools , hospitals and most types of restaurants and bars .
the other states are expected to follow suit by the end of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco drying sheds are a common sight in the palatinate " we all know that smoking is bad for your health , and so of course politicians have a difficult time standing up for tobacco as a product , especially at the federal level , " bähr said . " but just because the growers are n't there anymore does n't mean people will smoke less . " europe already imports 95 percent of its tobacco from outside its borders .
according to bähr , when the european crop collapses , cigarette manufacturers will just import the extra 5 percent from elsewhere . " then people will be yelling again : ' the rain forest in brazil is being felled for tobacco , we ca n't have that , ' and ' children are being exploited in the fields working in africa and india , " ' he said . " we do n't have any of that here in germany . " kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 03.09.2007 german expert : soccer 's popularity explains death rate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statistically speaking , golf and bowling are more dangerous than soccer with the recent heart-attack deaths of two pro soccer players and the near-death of another , watchers of the sport are wondering : just how dangerous is soccer ?
dw-world.de spoke with world cup doctor wilfried kindermann . dw-world.de : professor kindermann , two soccer players died suddenly of heart attacks in recent weeks , and another was just barely saved .
is this coincidence - or is there something more going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindermann advises checkups for over-35s wilfried kindermann : above all , i think it is a coincidence .
the fact that soccer is the top sport worldwide adds to the chances : the more people there are playing the sport means there are that many more who can die of a heart attack while playing it .
in the usa , for example , many more athlete deaths take place during basketball and football games .
but if you look at injury and death relative to the number of people who play a given sport , then things look entirely different : relatively mild activities like bowling and golf are at the top of the roster when it comes to sport-related death . but the people who died last week were professionals ; young athletes who were even under medical supervision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 03.09.2007 german tobacco farmers face gloomy future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a sign that 's not well liked by tobacco growers germany 's tobacco growers are in crisis mode .
with eu subsidies due to stop in 2009 , it 's predicted the crop will die out .
and given the current anti-smoking climate , there 's not a lot of sympathy for the farmers . farmer markus fischer is the fourth generation in his family to grow tobacco , and he 'll probably be the last .
about a sixth of his 150-hectare -lrb- 370-acre -rrb- farm in the southern palatinate region of germany is currently dedicated to tobacco , the farm 's main source of income .
but fischer is n't sure what the future holds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tobacco harvest is in full swing tobacco is a highly subsided crop in europe .
farmers earn around 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per kilo , and the eu pays about two euros per kilo on top of that . as part of the eu 's agricultural shake-up , these subsidies will be completely phased out by the end of 2009 , which will probably mean the end for germany 's 450 tobacco growers . " we ca n't cover our overheads without the subsidies , " fischer said . " for the amount we 're currently getting from the buyers , we wo n't be able to keep to producing . " examining other options like other farmers in the region , markus fischer and his family have already started looking into alternatives .
they have expanded their asparagus crop and started growing strawberries , although they will receive much less for these products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any extra income is welcome - the sign behind tobacco sheds advertises produce they have also built holiday houses on their land with the aim of establishing a farm-stay business .
fischer , however , still " hopes to keep growing tobacco , " because that is what he knows best . around 10,000 tons of virginia , burley and geudertheimer tobacco are harvested in germany , europe 's fifth biggest tobacco producer -lrb- italy sits in the number one spot -rrb- . most of germany 's tobacco farmers are based in the southwestern regions of baden and palatinate along the sunny rhine plain stretching from basel to mainz . more than 400 years of history tobacco has a long tradition in the palatinate .
the first recorded mention of the plant goes back to 1573 , when a priest started cultivating it as a medicinal herb .
now , approximately 1,200 hectares of tobacco are grown in the region - a third of germany 's total acreage dedicated to the crop . the plant has left an indelible mark on the area .
not only is the countryside dotted with tobacco fields and drying sheds , there are also frescos on houses depicting the harvest , tobacco sculptures , tobacco fountains , a tobacco museum and even a tobacco cycle path . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tobacco fountain in hexenheim is a reminder of the region 's heritage " if tobacco disappears , as it probably will if the situation does n't change , then we will also loose a part of our cultural tradition in the palatinate , " said jürg bähr , the head of the german tobacco grower 's association . the association is lobbying hard for an extension of the subsidies until 2013 so that the tobacco farmers have more time to convert to other crops . there 's no chance of the eu changing its payments scheme though - the subsidy cut was agreed and signed off on back in 2004 . the only chance for more money is from the federal government , but the current political climate is n't exactly supportive of tobacco . smoking bans federal bans on smoking in public transport , taxis , airports and government offices came into power in germany on sept .
1 , while in august , three states introduced anti-smoking laws in schools , hospitals and most types of restaurants and bars .
the other states are expected to follow suit by the end of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco drying sheds are a common sight in the palatinate " we all know that smoking is bad for your health , and so of course politicians have a difficult time standing up for tobacco as a product , especially at the federal level , " bähr said . " but just because the growers are n't there anymore does n't mean people will smoke less . " europe already imports 95 percent of its tobacco from outside its borders .
according to bähr , when the european crop collapses , cigarette manufacturers will just import the extra 5 percent from elsewhere . " then people will be yelling again : ' the rain forest in brazil is being felled for tobacco , we ca n't have that , ' and ' children are being exploited in the fields working in africa and india , " ' he said .

defense experts predict chaos and strained relations with the us once they leave iraq for good . after four-and-a-half years of inconclusive combat , british forces completed the last withdrawal of troops from the southern iraqi city of basra on monday .
the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .

for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .

" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .

" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .

" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .

defense experts predict chaos and strained relations with the us once they leave iraq for good . after four-and-a-half years of inconclusive combat , british forces completed the last withdrawal of troops from the southern iraqi city of basra on monday .
the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .

britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 03.09.2007 experts : uk iraq pullout a prelude to chaos , strained relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that the departing british will leave basra to the gangs and militias british troops withdrew from their basra palace base for the relative safety of their main compound outside the city monday .
defense experts predict chaos and strained relations with the us once they leave iraq for good . after four-and-a-half years of inconclusive combat , british forces completed the last withdrawal of troops from the southern iraqi city of basra on monday .
the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .
there will be no winners , just more losers .
for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .
instead , it marks a refocusing of a small army onto a war that is winnable and more important than iraq .
" the british army is at its smallest since 1842 and is hugely overstretched , " he said .
" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .
many policy experts warn of more chaos ahead .
basra left to the gangs and militias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra has proven particularly hard to control the international crisis group , a think tank specializing in conflict issues , warned in june that the withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the shiite militias who have bombarded british bases daily and control much of the city 's economic and political life .
" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .
giles merritt said he believes that the british have every faith that iraqi forces can handle basra but that how the iraqis react to being in control is impossible to predict .
" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .
" however , the future of basra depends on the different loyalties of the iraqi army .
do they uphold the rule of law or remain loyal to whatever militia they are part of ? "
tensions rise between coalition partners the pullout from basra and the eventual total withdrawal of british troops from iraq in the fall is likely to increase the pressure two-fold on the united states .
the security situation is expected to worsen and if the pentagon makes good on its promise to intervene in southern iraq to quell any unrest in basra , us forces will become even more overstretched .
and , calls both at home and abroad for a complete us withdrawal from iraq will increase .
" the writing has been on the wall for a long time in the us , " merritt added .
" policy makers have been openly talking about running down the commitment and if basra erupts , then it 'll make life a lot harder for the us .
washington is already very concerned but if the south burns it 's hard to believe the us decision will be to send in more troops .
" the us would have much preferred to see the british pull out in six months to a year , " he continued .
" politically , there will be tensions over this especially if the british withdrawal causes major security and policy problems for the us . "
armies trading insults and blame the situation in basra and the decision of the british to begin a phased withdrawal from iraq has also caused rising tensions between the two armies .

karlsruhe university - one of only three elite universities in germany - has been holding a children 's university every summer for the past five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interactive experiments proved to be a favorite " it 's a good way to introduce children of that age to science and research , " explained organizer margarete lehne over the din of 300 children who were anxiously waiting for the start of a science lecture . " they 're naturally very curious and so we want encourage them to use this natural curiosity to find out how things work . " complicated science as a gong sounded at the front of the lecture theater , the children gradually hushed to listen to professor norbert willenbacher , the head of karlsruhe university 's mechanics department .
willenbacher 's area of speciality is " rheology " - the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of applied stress .
it 's a complicated subject to teach to young children . " you have to avoid using scientific terms , and you have to talk a language which kids can understand , " willenbacher said .
luckily , he has four children at home to keep him in line when it comes to explaining science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching kids about science is important to willenbacher " they 're always telling me : ' be short , be precise , and do n't make it too complicated . '
that 's what i hear all the time when i talk to them about my work and my research , " willenbacher said with a smile . hands-on activities willenbacher packs many experiments into his 45-minute talk .
he shows that liquids can have different viscosity by dropping eggs into beakers of water and oil and getting children to measure the rate of fall .
he gets kids to bang on sauce bottles to explain that even though tomato sauce is a fluid , it only acts like one if force is applied . best of all , dozens of children get to run across a bath filled with rice starch mixed to a pudding-like consistency .
when the children run fast , they stay on the surface .

karlsruhe university - one of only three elite universities in germany - has been holding a children 's university every summer for the past five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interactive experiments proved to be a favorite " it 's a good way to introduce children of that age to science and research , " explained organizer margarete lehne over the din of 300 children who were anxiously waiting for the start of a science lecture . " they 're naturally very curious and so we want encourage them to use this natural curiosity to find out how things work . " complicated science as a gong sounded at the front of the lecture theater , the children gradually hushed to listen to professor norbert willenbacher , the head of karlsruhe university 's mechanics department .
willenbacher 's area of speciality is " rheology " - the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of applied stress .
it 's a complicated subject to teach to young children . " you have to avoid using scientific terms , and you have to talk a language which kids can understand , " willenbacher said .
luckily , he has four children at home to keep him in line when it comes to explaining science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching kids about science is important to willenbacher " they 're always telling me : ' be short , be precise , and do n't make it too complicated . '
that 's what i hear all the time when i talk to them about my work and my research , " willenbacher said with a smile . hands-on activities willenbacher packs many experiments into his 45-minute talk .
he shows that liquids can have different viscosity by dropping eggs into beakers of water and oil and getting children to measure the rate of fall .
he gets kids to bang on sauce bottles to explain that even though tomato sauce is a fluid , it only acts like one if force is applied . best of all , dozens of children get to run across a bath filled with rice starch mixed to a pudding-like consistency .
when the children run fast , they stay on the surface .

karlsruhe university - one of only three elite universities in germany - has been holding a children 's university every summer for the past five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interactive experiments proved to be a favorite " it 's a good way to introduce children of that age to science and research , " explained organizer margarete lehne over the din of 300 children who were anxiously waiting for the start of a science lecture . " they 're naturally very curious and so we want encourage them to use this natural curiosity to find out how things work . " complicated science as a gong sounded at the front of the lecture theater , the children gradually hushed to listen to professor norbert willenbacher , the head of karlsruhe university 's mechanics department .
willenbacher 's area of speciality is " rheology " - the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of applied stress .
it 's a complicated subject to teach to young children . " you have to avoid using scientific terms , and you have to talk a language which kids can understand , " willenbacher said .
luckily , he has four children at home to keep him in line when it comes to explaining science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching kids about science is important to willenbacher " they 're always telling me : ' be short , be precise , and do n't make it too complicated . '
that 's what i hear all the time when i talk to them about my work and my research , " willenbacher said with a smile . hands-on activities willenbacher packs many experiments into his 45-minute talk .
he shows that liquids can have different viscosity by dropping eggs into beakers of water and oil and getting children to measure the rate of fall .
he gets kids to bang on sauce bottles to explain that even though tomato sauce is a fluid , it only acts like one if force is applied . best of all , dozens of children get to run across a bath filled with rice starch mixed to a pudding-like consistency .
when the children run fast , they stay on the surface .
when they go slowly , they sink into the oozing mass .
this demonstrates that plastic solids can have the properties of liquids under a heavy load .
willenbacher said it was lots of extra work to make his lecture kid-friendly , but it was worth it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children 's university proves science can be fun " i think it 's really part of scientists ' job , " he said .
" i am dedicated to science and i have fun with science , and i want to show this to the children . " popular program more than 5,000 children between the ages of five and 12 regularly come to the children 's university in karlsruhe , attending lectures on subjects ranging from electrical engineering to biology , meteorology , and architecture . eleven-year old theresa has been to all of the lectures offered at there this summer .
she thought willenbacher 's lecture was " fantastic . " " the best thing about it was the experiments because they were fun , " she said .
" at school you always have to be careful , and information is just fed to you - they just tell you stuff .
but here they also did experiments . " according to the organizers , the only real complaints about the children 's university come from the adults who are miffed about having to wait outside .

defense experts predict chaos and strained relations with the us once they leave iraq for good . after four-and-a-half years of inconclusive combat , british forces completed the last withdrawal of troops from the southern iraqi city of basra on monday .
the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .
there will be no winners , just more losers .
for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .
instead , it marks a refocusing of a small army onto a war that is winnable and more important than iraq .
" the british army is at its smallest since 1842 and is hugely overstretched , " he said .
" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .
many policy experts warn of more chaos ahead .
basra left to the gangs and militias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra has proven particularly hard to control the international crisis group , a think tank specializing in conflict issues , warned in june that the withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the shiite militias who have bombarded british bases daily and control much of the city 's economic and political life .
" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .
giles merritt said he believes that the british have every faith that iraqi forces can handle basra but that how the iraqis react to being in control is impossible to predict .
" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .
" however , the future of basra depends on the different loyalties of the iraqi army .
do they uphold the rule of law or remain loyal to whatever militia they are part of ? "
tensions rise between coalition partners the pullout from basra and the eventual total withdrawal of british troops from iraq in the fall is likely to increase the pressure two-fold on the united states .
the security situation is expected to worsen and if the pentagon makes good on its promise to intervene in southern iraq to quell any unrest in basra , us forces will become even more overstretched .
and , calls both at home and abroad for a complete us withdrawal from iraq will increase .
" the writing has been on the wall for a long time in the us , " merritt added .
" policy makers have been openly talking about running down the commitment and if basra erupts , then it 'll make life a lot harder for the us .
washington is already very concerned but if the south burns it 's hard to believe the us decision will be to send in more troops .
" the us would have much preferred to see the british pull out in six months to a year , " he continued .
" politically , there will be tensions over this especially if the british withdrawal causes major security and policy problems for the us . "
armies trading insults and blame the situation in basra and the decision of the british to begin a phased withdrawal from iraq has also caused rising tensions between the two armies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british blame rumsfeld for the post-invasion chaos general jack keane , a former vice chief-of-staff of the us army , said last month there was " frustration " in washington at the deteriorating security situation in the british-run area .
meanwhile retired major general tim cross , the top british officer involved in planning post-war iraq , hit back , saying he had raised serious concerns with then us defense secretary donald rumsfeld about the possibility of the country descending into chaos but rumsfeld had " ignored " or " dismissed " his warnings .
british general sir mike jackson also branded us post-invasion policy " intellectually bankrupt " and said rumsfeld was " one of the most responsible for the current situation in iraq .

" we are planning a new migration initiative , " eu commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told the web site of german newspaper die welt .
" the aim of this strategy is to stem illegal immigration , to encourage the flow of legal migrants and to remedy a lack of skilled labor in some eu economies . " aimed at certain migrants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : listening for change : benita ferrero-waldner the plan would set up so-called " mobility partnerships " that would allow people from outside the eu to enter legally , although they would only be able to stay for a specific period of time . at the same time - according to the labor needs of specific countries - they could get a work visa , ferrero-waldner said . the initiative is part of the eu 's 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- strong european neighborhood policy of mutual cooperation .
the enp is tailored to create a ring of peaceful and economically advanced states around the eu 's borders , and covers 16 countries , including ukraine , moldova , egypt , algeria , tunisia and israel . countries still have choice in the end , each eu country could choose how many immigrants it is willing to take in , and in which fields they should issue work visas , ferrero-waldner specified . but the new initiative is aimed at widening the scope of the eu 's free movement policy , where citizens in the 27-nation bloc can move between member states . by making it easier to get visas , the plan would increase demographic mobility , ferrero-waldner said . during the latest eu expansion , in 2004 , hundreds of thousands of workers from the 10 central and eastern european countries that joined the union headed to the old eu countries for work . germany seeks engineers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu expansion allowed more migration flexibilty countries like great britain , ireland and sweden opened up their labor markets from the beginning - with positive economic results , early studies show .

' this policy makes us all more secure ' while the enp is high on brussels ' political agenda , it has found less resonance among eu citizens .
a recent poll suggested 54 percent of europeans show little interest in what is happening outside the bloc 's borders , the eu observer reported .

" we are planning a new migration initiative , " eu commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told the web site of german newspaper die welt .
" the aim of this strategy is to stem illegal immigration , to encourage the flow of legal migrants and to remedy a lack of skilled labor in some eu economies . " aimed at certain migrants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : listening for change : benita ferrero-waldner the plan would set up so-called " mobility partnerships " that would allow people from outside the eu to enter legally , although they would only be able to stay for a specific period of time . at the same time - according to the labor needs of specific countries - they could get a work visa , ferrero-waldner said . the initiative is part of the eu 's 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- strong european neighborhood policy of mutual cooperation .
the enp is tailored to create a ring of peaceful and economically advanced states around the eu 's borders , and covers 16 countries , including ukraine , moldova , egypt , algeria , tunisia and israel . countries still have choice in the end , each eu country could choose how many immigrants it is willing to take in , and in which fields they should issue work visas , ferrero-waldner specified . but the new initiative is aimed at widening the scope of the eu 's free movement policy , where citizens in the 27-nation bloc can move between member states . by making it easier to get visas , the plan would increase demographic mobility , ferrero-waldner said . during the latest eu expansion , in 2004 , hundreds of thousands of workers from the 10 central and eastern european countries that joined the union headed to the old eu countries for work . germany seeks engineers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu expansion allowed more migration flexibilty countries like great britain , ireland and sweden opened up their labor markets from the beginning - with positive economic results , early studies show .
but germany , europe 's largest economy , continues to keep a tight regulatory rein on immigration . last month , however , germany said it would open its doors to engineers from eastern europe earlier than planned , to help compensate for a shortage of skilled workers in the sector . ' this policy makes us all more secure ' while the enp is high on brussels ' political agenda , it has found less resonance among eu citizens .
a recent poll suggested 54 percent of europeans show little interest in what is happening outside the bloc 's borders , the eu observer reported . " i hope that more and more people will appreciate that this policy makes us all more secure and that the advantages the european neighborhood policy brings are well worth the cost , " ferrero-waldner told the eu observe r in response to the poll dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 03.09.2007 german expert : soccer 's popularity explains death rate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statistically speaking , golf and bowling are more dangerous than soccer with the recent heart-attack deaths of two pro soccer players and the near-death of another , watchers of the sport are wondering : just how dangerous is soccer ?
dw-world.de spoke with world cup doctor wilfried kindermann . dw-world.de : professor kindermann , two soccer players died suddenly of heart attacks in recent weeks , and another was just barely saved .
is this coincidence - or is there something more going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindermann advises checkups for over-35s wilfried kindermann : above all , i think it is a coincidence .
the fact that soccer is the top sport worldwide adds to the chances : the more people there are playing the sport means there are that many more who can die of a heart attack while playing it .
in the usa , for example , many more athlete deaths take place during basketball and football games .
but if you look at injury and death relative to the number of people who play a given sport , then things look entirely different : relatively mild activities like bowling and golf are at the top of the roster when it comes to sport-related death . but the people who died last week were professionals ; young athletes who were even under medical supervision .
you would think they were particularly healthy , and unlikely to die of a heart attack . yes , there are people who appear healthy , but who either were n't examined at all , or who were n't examined well enough .
these sudden deaths are almost always due to some underlying illness .
in young athletes , for example , there is almost always inborn heart-muscle hypertrophy , malformed coronary arteries , or myocarditis . should the doctors who were supervising these players be accused of not keeping a close enough eye on their charges ? well , first you have to know whether they were examined at all .
hypertrophy can be easily diagnosed with an ultrasound .
in german soccer we have a very good system .
all players in the first and second german soccer leagues have a heart check before each season . everyone knows that doping is particularly damaging to the cardiovascular system .
can we rule out that the two players who died were involved in doping ? doping can , indeed , lead to heart damage - arhythmia , and sudden death from heart attack .
but it is really difficult to test for doping after someone 's death .
in most cases you can rule it out , but you ca n't always prove it after a death .
there were 15 deaths in competitive soccer in the last 10 years .
how many cases are we talking about worldwide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zambia 's chaswe nsofwa died suddenly during a practice session in israel that is an important question , because i would like to make it very clear that the numbers are really quite small .
we think there are some 100,000 sudden heart-attack deaths per year among people active in sports .
any sport that taxes the body is a danger - if the athlete is unhealthy .
if i start doing sports with an undiagnosed heart ailment , i am taking a risk . so if i want to go kick a ball around with my buddies after work tonight , i should go to the doctor first ? after a certain age , you should know about the state of your health .
right now we hold to the basic rule that anyone over 35 should have a checkup if they plan to do sports .
but i have to also make it clear that doing sports , per se , is healthy .
and people who are active have a smaller chance of dying of a heart attack than someone who is not .
in germany there are 100,000 sudden deaths from heart attack each year - and almost none of them have to do with sports . in the 1960s you were a competitive athlete .
were you examined back then ? oh , yes , i can remember it exactly .
i was a 400-meter runner and had to pedal a bicycle ergometer while lying down .
the doctor was surprised by my relatively weak performance .
wilfried kindermann , born in 1940 , was a member of the team that won the gold medal in the 4x 400-meter relay race in the european athletics championships in 1962 .
today he is one of the germany 's leading sports-medicine authorities .
he has been the chief physician of germany 's national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- for seven olympic games ; chief physician at fifa confederation cup 2005 and soccer world cup 2006 , a member of the medical committee of the european football association -lrb- uefa -rrb- ; deputy chairman of the german football association 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- commission on sports medicine ; internist for the german national football team 1990-2000 ; and member of the scientific advisory committee of the german heart association .

paranoia strikes ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bullying is not always left at the school gates such people can also have a paranoid fear that they are being mobbed by co-workers or that their boss is intentionally burdening them with inhuman workloads and impossible deadlines .
they resort to alcohol or medication or seeking sick leave or early retirement .
" job anxieties , therefore , must be considered expensive problems , " warns linden , who is one of germany 's leading experts in chronic depression , phobias and psychosomatic rehabilitation treatments .
he estimates that as many as half of all workers on long-term sick leave may in fact show signs and symptoms of work-related anxiety .

dw-world.de spoke with world cup doctor wilfried kindermann . dw-world.de : professor kindermann , two soccer players died suddenly of heart attacks in recent weeks , and another was just barely saved .
is this coincidence - or is there something more going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindermann advises checkups for over-35s wilfried kindermann : above all , i think it is a coincidence .
the fact that soccer is the top sport worldwide adds to the chances : the more people there are playing the sport means there are that many more who can die of a heart attack while playing it .
in the usa , for example , many more athlete deaths take place during basketball and football games .
but if you look at injury and death relative to the number of people who play a given sport , then things look entirely different : relatively mild activities like bowling and golf are at the top of the roster when it comes to sport-related death . but the people who died last week were professionals ; young athletes who were even under medical supervision .
you would think they were particularly healthy , and unlikely to die of a heart attack . yes , there are people who appear healthy , but who either were n't examined at all , or who were n't examined well enough .
these sudden deaths are almost always due to some underlying illness .
in young athletes , for example , there is almost always inborn heart-muscle hypertrophy , malformed coronary arteries , or myocarditis . should the doctors who were supervising these players be accused of not keeping a close enough eye on their charges ? well , first you have to know whether they were examined at all .
hypertrophy can be easily diagnosed with an ultrasound .
in german soccer we have a very good system .
all players in the first and second german soccer leagues have a heart check before each season . everyone knows that doping is particularly damaging to the cardiovascular system .
can we rule out that the two players who died were involved in doping ? doping can , indeed , lead to heart damage - arhythmia , and sudden death from heart attack .
but it is really difficult to test for doping after someone 's death .
in most cases you can rule it out , but you ca n't always prove it after a death .
there were 15 deaths in competitive soccer in the last 10 years .
how many cases are we talking about worldwide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zambia 's chaswe nsofwa died suddenly during a practice session in israel that is an important question , because i would like to make it very clear that the numbers are really quite small .
we think there are some 100,000 sudden heart-attack deaths per year among people active in sports .
any sport that taxes the body is a danger - if the athlete is unhealthy .
if i start doing sports with an undiagnosed heart ailment , i am taking a risk . so if i want to go kick a ball around with my buddies after work tonight , i should go to the doctor first ? after a certain age , you should know about the state of your health .
right now we hold to the basic rule that anyone over 35 should have a checkup if they plan to do sports .
but i have to also make it clear that doing sports , per se , is healthy .
and people who are active have a smaller chance of dying of a heart attack than someone who is not .
in germany there are 100,000 sudden deaths from heart attack each year - and almost none of them have to do with sports . in the 1960s you were a competitive athlete .

gdf-suez will become one of europe 's biggest energy conglomerates . french president nicolas sarkozy brokered terms of the deal , which the companies ' boards agreed to late sunday .
the new company , called gdf-suez , will become one of europe 's largest energy conglomerates along with russia 's state-run gazprom , electricite de france and germany 's eon .
the two companies have a combined market value of 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122.8 billion -rrb- although suez will spin off many of its environmental assets , valued by analysts at 18-20 billion euros .
merger of equals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protected from foreign takeover the merger was first conceived 18 months ago , but was delayed by disagreements over valuation and control .
the final agreement will include a share exchange ratio of 0.9545 to 1 , or 21 gaz de france shares for 22 suez shares , the groups said in a joint statement .
sarkozy , who was elected in may and has promised economic reforms , pressured suez to abandon most of its water and waste assets to focus on energy .
besides distributing gas and electricity , suez runs power stations , pumps water and manages waste .
under terms of the deal , suez will divest 65 percent of its environmental activities through a stock market listing , scheduled to take place at the same time as the merger .
unions oppose privatization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big business sarkozy pushed for the merger to prevent a foreign takeover of suez and to strengthen gaz de france 's power assets .
the deal is the latest version of a plan first announced by former prime minister dominique de villepin in early 2006 to protect suez from a possible takeover by italy 's enel .
france 's unions and the socialists have opposed the merger because it would remove the government 's control over gaz de france .
the government owns 80 percent of gaz de france .
finance minister christine lagarde said the government will keep significantly more than a blocking minority of 35 percent .
the combined group will be led by suez chief executive officer gerard mestrallet with the state-owned gas utility 's jean-francois cirelli becoming the vice chairman .
the merged company has set a cost savings target of 1 billion euros by 2013 , according to bloomberg news service .
the transaction to create gdf suez will be completed " as early as possible " in 2008 , the companies said in a statement .

now , approximately 1,200 hectares of tobacco are grown in the region - a third of germany 's total acreage dedicated to the crop . the plant has left an indelible mark on the area .
not only is the countryside dotted with tobacco fields and drying sheds , there are also frescos on houses depicting the harvest , tobacco sculptures , tobacco fountains , a tobacco museum and even a tobacco cycle path . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tobacco fountain in hexenheim is a reminder of the region 's heritage " if tobacco disappears , as it probably will if the situation does n't change , then we will also loose a part of our cultural tradition in the palatinate , " said jürg bähr , the head of the german tobacco grower 's association . the association is lobbying hard for an extension of the subsidies until 2013 so that the tobacco farmers have more time to convert to other crops . there 's no chance of the eu changing its payments scheme though - the subsidy cut was agreed and signed off on back in 2004 . the only chance for more money is from the federal government , but the current political climate is n't exactly supportive of tobacco . smoking bans federal bans on smoking in public transport , taxis , airports and government offices came into power in germany on sept .
1 , while in august , three states introduced anti-smoking laws in schools , hospitals and most types of restaurants and bars .
the other states are expected to follow suit by the end of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco drying sheds are a common sight in the palatinate " we all know that smoking is bad for your health , and so of course politicians have a difficult time standing up for tobacco as a product , especially at the federal level , " bähr said . " but just because the growers are n't there anymore does n't mean people will smoke less . " europe already imports 95 percent of its tobacco from outside its borders .
according to bähr , when the european crop collapses , cigarette manufacturers will just import the extra 5 percent from elsewhere . " then people will be yelling again : ' the rain forest in brazil is being felled for tobacco , we ca n't have that , ' and ' children are being exploited in the fields working in africa and india , " ' he said . " we do n't have any of that here in germany . " kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de first smoking bans take effect in german states other european countries have enforced nationwide bans against smoking .
in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative .
-lrb- 01.08.2007 -rrb- finland to ban smoking in bars and restaurants on june 1 on friday , finland is to become the latest european nation to ban smoking in bars and restaurants , a measure that is expected to be introduced fairly painlessly in the tobacco-critical state .

karlsruhe university - one of only three elite universities in germany - has been holding a children 's university every summer for the past five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interactive experiments proved to be a favorite " it 's a good way to introduce children of that age to science and research , " explained organizer margarete lehne over the din of 300 children who were anxiously waiting for the start of a science lecture . " they 're naturally very curious and so we want encourage them to use this natural curiosity to find out how things work . " complicated science as a gong sounded at the front of the lecture theater , the children gradually hushed to listen to professor norbert willenbacher , the head of karlsruhe university 's mechanics department .
willenbacher 's area of speciality is " rheology " - the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of applied stress .
it 's a complicated subject to teach to young children . " you have to avoid using scientific terms , and you have to talk a language which kids can understand , " willenbacher said .
luckily , he has four children at home to keep him in line when it comes to explaining science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching kids about science is important to willenbacher " they 're always telling me : ' be short , be precise , and do n't make it too complicated . '
that 's what i hear all the time when i talk to them about my work and my research , " willenbacher said with a smile . hands-on activities willenbacher packs many experiments into his 45-minute talk .
he shows that liquids can have different viscosity by dropping eggs into beakers of water and oil and getting children to measure the rate of fall .
he gets kids to bang on sauce bottles to explain that even though tomato sauce is a fluid , it only acts like one if force is applied . best of all , dozens of children get to run across a bath filled with rice starch mixed to a pudding-like consistency .
when the children run fast , they stay on the surface .
when they go slowly , they sink into the oozing mass .
this demonstrates that plastic solids can have the properties of liquids under a heavy load .
willenbacher said it was lots of extra work to make his lecture kid-friendly , but it was worth it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children 's university proves science can be fun " i think it 's really part of scientists ' job , " he said .
" i am dedicated to science and i have fun with science , and i want to show this to the children . " popular program more than 5,000 children between the ages of five and 12 regularly come to the children 's university in karlsruhe , attending lectures on subjects ranging from electrical engineering to biology , meteorology , and architecture . eleven-year old theresa has been to all of the lectures offered at there this summer .
she thought willenbacher 's lecture was " fantastic . " " the best thing about it was the experiments because they were fun , " she said .
" at school you always have to be careful , and information is just fed to you - they just tell you stuff .
but here they also did experiments . " according to the organizers , the only real complaints about the children 's university come from the adults who are miffed about having to wait outside .

with eu subsidies due to stop in 2009 , it 's predicted the crop will die out .
and given the current anti-smoking climate , there 's not a lot of sympathy for the farmers . farmer markus fischer is the fourth generation in his family to grow tobacco , and he 'll probably be the last .
about a sixth of his 150-hectare -lrb- 370-acre -rrb- farm in the southern palatinate region of germany is currently dedicated to tobacco , the farm 's main source of income .
but fischer is n't sure what the future holds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tobacco harvest is in full swing tobacco is a highly subsided crop in europe .
farmers earn around 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per kilo , and the eu pays about two euros per kilo on top of that . as part of the eu 's agricultural shake-up , these subsidies will be completely phased out by the end of 2009 , which will probably mean the end for germany 's 450 tobacco growers . " we ca n't cover our overheads without the subsidies , " fischer said . " for the amount we 're currently getting from the buyers , we wo n't be able to keep to producing . " examining other options like other farmers in the region , markus fischer and his family have already started looking into alternatives .
they have expanded their asparagus crop and started growing strawberries , although they will receive much less for these products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any extra income is welcome - the sign behind tobacco sheds advertises produce they have also built holiday houses on their land with the aim of establishing a farm-stay business .
fischer , however , still " hopes to keep growing tobacco , " because that is what he knows best . around 10,000 tons of virginia , burley and geudertheimer tobacco are harvested in germany , europe 's fifth biggest tobacco producer -lrb- italy sits in the number one spot -rrb- . most of germany 's tobacco farmers are based in the southwestern regions of baden and palatinate along the sunny rhine plain stretching from basel to mainz . more than 400 years of history tobacco has a long tradition in the palatinate .
the first recorded mention of the plant goes back to 1573 , when a priest started cultivating it as a medicinal herb .
now , approximately 1,200 hectares of tobacco are grown in the region - a third of germany 's total acreage dedicated to the crop . the plant has left an indelible mark on the area .
not only is the countryside dotted with tobacco fields and drying sheds , there are also frescos on houses depicting the harvest , tobacco sculptures , tobacco fountains , a tobacco museum and even a tobacco cycle path . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tobacco fountain in hexenheim is a reminder of the region 's heritage " if tobacco disappears , as it probably will if the situation does n't change , then we will also loose a part of our cultural tradition in the palatinate , " said jürg bähr , the head of the german tobacco grower 's association . the association is lobbying hard for an extension of the subsidies until 2013 so that the tobacco farmers have more time to convert to other crops . there 's no chance of the eu changing its payments scheme though - the subsidy cut was agreed and signed off on back in 2004 . the only chance for more money is from the federal government , but the current political climate is n't exactly supportive of tobacco . smoking bans federal bans on smoking in public transport , taxis , airports and government offices came into power in germany on sept .
1 , while in august , three states introduced anti-smoking laws in schools , hospitals and most types of restaurants and bars .
the other states are expected to follow suit by the end of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco drying sheds are a common sight in the palatinate " we all know that smoking is bad for your health , and so of course politicians have a difficult time standing up for tobacco as a product , especially at the federal level , " bähr said . " but just because the growers are n't there anymore does n't mean people will smoke less . " europe already imports 95 percent of its tobacco from outside its borders .
according to bähr , when the european crop collapses , cigarette manufacturers will just import the extra 5 percent from elsewhere . " then people will be yelling again : ' the rain forest in brazil is being felled for tobacco , we ca n't have that , ' and ' children are being exploited in the fields working in africa and india , " ' he said .

" we are planning a new migration initiative , " eu commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told the web site of german newspaper die welt .
" the aim of this strategy is to stem illegal immigration , to encourage the flow of legal migrants and to remedy a lack of skilled labor in some eu economies . " aimed at certain migrants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : listening for change : benita ferrero-waldner the plan would set up so-called " mobility partnerships " that would allow people from outside the eu to enter legally , although they would only be able to stay for a specific period of time . at the same time - according to the labor needs of specific countries - they could get a work visa , ferrero-waldner said . the initiative is part of the eu 's 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- strong european neighborhood policy of mutual cooperation .
the enp is tailored to create a ring of peaceful and economically advanced states around the eu 's borders , and covers 16 countries , including ukraine , moldova , egypt , algeria , tunisia and israel . countries still have choice in the end , each eu country could choose how many immigrants it is willing to take in , and in which fields they should issue work visas , ferrero-waldner specified . but the new initiative is aimed at widening the scope of the eu 's free movement policy , where citizens in the 27-nation bloc can move between member states . by making it easier to get visas , the plan would increase demographic mobility , ferrero-waldner said . during the latest eu expansion , in 2004 , hundreds of thousands of workers from the 10 central and eastern european countries that joined the union headed to the old eu countries for work . germany seeks engineers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu expansion allowed more migration flexibilty countries like great britain , ireland and sweden opened up their labor markets from the beginning - with positive economic results , early studies show .

' this policy makes us all more secure ' while the enp is high on brussels ' political agenda , it has found less resonance among eu citizens .
a recent poll suggested 54 percent of europeans show little interest in what is happening outside the bloc 's borders , the eu observer reported .

karlsruhe university - one of only three elite universities in germany - has been holding a children 's university every summer for the past five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interactive experiments proved to be a favorite " it 's a good way to introduce children of that age to science and research , " explained organizer margarete lehne over the din of 300 children who were anxiously waiting for the start of a science lecture . " they 're naturally very curious and so we want encourage them to use this natural curiosity to find out how things work . " complicated science as a gong sounded at the front of the lecture theater , the children gradually hushed to listen to professor norbert willenbacher , the head of karlsruhe university 's mechanics department .
willenbacher 's area of speciality is " rheology " - the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of applied stress .
it 's a complicated subject to teach to young children . " you have to avoid using scientific terms , and you have to talk a language which kids can understand , " willenbacher said .
luckily , he has four children at home to keep him in line when it comes to explaining science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching kids about science is important to willenbacher " they 're always telling me : ' be short , be precise , and do n't make it too complicated .

that 's what i hear all the time when i talk to them about my work and my research , " willenbacher said with a smile . hands-on activities willenbacher packs many experiments into his 45-minute talk .
he shows that liquids can have different viscosity by dropping eggs into beakers of water and oil and getting children to measure the rate of fall .
he gets kids to bang on sauce bottles to explain that even though tomato sauce is a fluid , it only acts like one if force is applied . best of all , dozens of children get to run across a bath filled with rice starch mixed to a pudding-like consistency .
when the children run fast , they stay on the surface .
when they go slowly , they sink into the oozing mass .
this demonstrates that plastic solids can have the properties of liquids under a heavy load .
willenbacher said it was lots of extra work to make his lecture kid-friendly , but it was worth it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children 's university proves science can be fun " i think it 's really part of scientists ' job , " he said .

she thought willenbacher 's lecture was " fantastic . " " the best thing about it was the experiments because they were fun , " she said .
" at school you always have to be careful , and information is just fed to you - they just tell you stuff .

with eu subsidies due to stop in 2009 , it 's predicted the crop will die out .
and given the current anti-smoking climate , there 's not a lot of sympathy for the farmers . farmer markus fischer is the fourth generation in his family to grow tobacco , and he 'll probably be the last .
about a sixth of his 150-hectare -lrb- 370-acre -rrb- farm in the southern palatinate region of germany is currently dedicated to tobacco , the farm 's main source of income .
but fischer is n't sure what the future holds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tobacco harvest is in full swing tobacco is a highly subsided crop in europe .
farmers earn around 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per kilo , and the eu pays about two euros per kilo on top of that . as part of the eu 's agricultural shake-up , these subsidies will be completely phased out by the end of 2009 , which will probably mean the end for germany 's 450 tobacco growers . " we ca n't cover our overheads without the subsidies , " fischer said . " for the amount we 're currently getting from the buyers , we wo n't be able to keep to producing . " examining other options like other farmers in the region , markus fischer and his family have already started looking into alternatives .
they have expanded their asparagus crop and started growing strawberries , although they will receive much less for these products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any extra income is welcome - the sign behind tobacco sheds advertises produce they have also built holiday houses on their land with the aim of establishing a farm-stay business .
fischer , however , still " hopes to keep growing tobacco , " because that is what he knows best . around 10,000 tons of virginia , burley and geudertheimer tobacco are harvested in germany , europe 's fifth biggest tobacco producer -lrb- italy sits in the number one spot -rrb- . most of germany 's tobacco farmers are based in the southwestern regions of baden and palatinate along the sunny rhine plain stretching from basel to mainz . more than 400 years of history tobacco has a long tradition in the palatinate .
the first recorded mention of the plant goes back to 1573 , when a priest started cultivating it as a medicinal herb .
now , approximately 1,200 hectares of tobacco are grown in the region - a third of germany 's total acreage dedicated to the crop . the plant has left an indelible mark on the area .
not only is the countryside dotted with tobacco fields and drying sheds , there are also frescos on houses depicting the harvest , tobacco sculptures , tobacco fountains , a tobacco museum and even a tobacco cycle path . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tobacco fountain in hexenheim is a reminder of the region 's heritage " if tobacco disappears , as it probably will if the situation does n't change , then we will also loose a part of our cultural tradition in the palatinate , " said jürg bähr , the head of the german tobacco grower 's association . the association is lobbying hard for an extension of the subsidies until 2013 so that the tobacco farmers have more time to convert to other crops . there 's no chance of the eu changing its payments scheme though - the subsidy cut was agreed and signed off on back in 2004 . the only chance for more money is from the federal government , but the current political climate is n't exactly supportive of tobacco . smoking bans federal bans on smoking in public transport , taxis , airports and government offices came into power in germany on sept .
1 , while in august , three states introduced anti-smoking laws in schools , hospitals and most types of restaurants and bars .
the other states are expected to follow suit by the end of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco drying sheds are a common sight in the palatinate " we all know that smoking is bad for your health , and so of course politicians have a difficult time standing up for tobacco as a product , especially at the federal level , " bähr said . " but just because the growers are n't there anymore does n't mean people will smoke less . " europe already imports 95 percent of its tobacco from outside its borders .
according to bähr , when the european crop collapses , cigarette manufacturers will just import the extra 5 percent from elsewhere . " then people will be yelling again : ' the rain forest in brazil is being felled for tobacco , we ca n't have that , ' and ' children are being exploited in the fields working in africa and india , " ' he said . " we do n't have any of that here in germany . " kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with eu subsidies due to stop in 2009 , it 's predicted the crop will die out .
and given the current anti-smoking climate , there 's not a lot of sympathy for the farmers . farmer markus fischer is the fourth generation in his family to grow tobacco , and he 'll probably be the last .
about a sixth of his 150-hectare -lrb- 370-acre -rrb- farm in the southern palatinate region of germany is currently dedicated to tobacco , the farm 's main source of income .
but fischer is n't sure what the future holds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tobacco harvest is in full swing tobacco is a highly subsided crop in europe .
farmers earn around 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per kilo , and the eu pays about two euros per kilo on top of that . as part of the eu 's agricultural shake-up , these subsidies will be completely phased out by the end of 2009 , which will probably mean the end for germany 's 450 tobacco growers . " we ca n't cover our overheads without the subsidies , " fischer said . " for the amount we 're currently getting from the buyers , we wo n't be able to keep to producing . " examining other options like other farmers in the region , markus fischer and his family have already started looking into alternatives .
they have expanded their asparagus crop and started growing strawberries , although they will receive much less for these products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any extra income is welcome - the sign behind tobacco sheds advertises produce they have also built holiday houses on their land with the aim of establishing a farm-stay business .

gdf-suez will become one of europe 's biggest energy conglomerates . french president nicolas sarkozy brokered terms of the deal , which the companies ' boards agreed to late sunday .
the new company , called gdf-suez , will become one of europe 's largest energy conglomerates along with russia 's state-run gazprom , electricite de france and germany 's eon .
the two companies have a combined market value of 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122.8 billion -rrb- although suez will spin off many of its environmental assets , valued by analysts at 18-20 billion euros .
merger of equals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protected from foreign takeover the merger was first conceived 18 months ago , but was delayed by disagreements over valuation and control .
the final agreement will include a share exchange ratio of 0.9545 to 1 , or 21 gaz de france shares for 22 suez shares , the groups said in a joint statement .
sarkozy , who was elected in may and has promised economic reforms , pressured suez to abandon most of its water and waste assets to focus on energy .
besides distributing gas and electricity , suez runs power stations , pumps water and manages waste .
under terms of the deal , suez will divest 65 percent of its environmental activities through a stock market listing , scheduled to take place at the same time as the merger .
unions oppose privatization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big business sarkozy pushed for the merger to prevent a foreign takeover of suez and to strengthen gaz de france 's power assets .
the deal is the latest version of a plan first announced by former prime minister dominique de villepin in early 2006 to protect suez from a possible takeover by italy 's enel .
france 's unions and the socialists have opposed the merger because it would remove the government 's control over gaz de france .
the government owns 80 percent of gaz de france .
finance minister christine lagarde said the government will keep significantly more than a blocking minority of 35 percent .
the combined group will be led by suez chief executive officer gerard mestrallet with the state-owned gas utility 's jean-francois cirelli becoming the vice chairman .
the merged company has set a cost savings target of 1 billion euros by 2013 , according to bloomberg news service .
the transaction to create gdf suez will be completed " as early as possible " in 2008 , the companies said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 03.09.2007 german expert : soccer 's popularity explains death rate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statistically speaking , golf and bowling are more dangerous than soccer with the recent heart-attack deaths of two pro soccer players and the near-death of another , watchers of the sport are wondering : just how dangerous is soccer ?
dw-world.de spoke with world cup doctor wilfried kindermann . dw-world.de : professor kindermann , two soccer players died suddenly of heart attacks in recent weeks , and another was just barely saved .
is this coincidence - or is there something more going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindermann advises checkups for over-35s wilfried kindermann : above all , i think it is a coincidence .
the fact that soccer is the top sport worldwide adds to the chances : the more people there are playing the sport means there are that many more who can die of a heart attack while playing it .
in the usa , for example , many more athlete deaths take place during basketball and football games .
but if you look at injury and death relative to the number of people who play a given sport , then things look entirely different : relatively mild activities like bowling and golf are at the top of the roster when it comes to sport-related death . but the people who died last week were professionals ; young athletes who were even under medical supervision .
you would think they were particularly healthy , and unlikely to die of a heart attack . yes , there are people who appear healthy , but who either were n't examined at all , or who were n't examined well enough .
these sudden deaths are almost always due to some underlying illness .
in young athletes , for example , there is almost always inborn heart-muscle hypertrophy , malformed coronary arteries , or myocarditis . should the doctors who were supervising these players be accused of not keeping a close enough eye on their charges ? well , first you have to know whether they were examined at all .
hypertrophy can be easily diagnosed with an ultrasound .
in german soccer we have a very good system .
all players in the first and second german soccer leagues have a heart check before each season . everyone knows that doping is particularly damaging to the cardiovascular system .
can we rule out that the two players who died were involved in doping ? doping can , indeed , lead to heart damage - arhythmia , and sudden death from heart attack .
but it is really difficult to test for doping after someone 's death .
in most cases you can rule it out , but you ca n't always prove it after a death .
there were 15 deaths in competitive soccer in the last 10 years .
how many cases are we talking about worldwide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zambia 's chaswe nsofwa died suddenly during a practice session in israel that is an important question , because i would like to make it very clear that the numbers are really quite small .
we think there are some 100,000 sudden heart-attack deaths per year among people active in sports .
any sport that taxes the body is a danger - if the athlete is unhealthy .
if i start doing sports with an undiagnosed heart ailment , i am taking a risk . so if i want to go kick a ball around with my buddies after work tonight , i should go to the doctor first ? after a certain age , you should know about the state of your health .
right now we hold to the basic rule that anyone over 35 should have a checkup if they plan to do sports .
but i have to also make it clear that doing sports , per se , is healthy .
and people who are active have a smaller chance of dying of a heart attack than someone who is not .
in germany there are 100,000 sudden deaths from heart attack each year - and almost none of them have to do with sports . in the 1960s you were a competitive athlete .
were you examined back then ? oh , yes , i can remember it exactly .
i was a 400-meter runner and had to pedal a bicycle ergometer while lying down .
the doctor was surprised by my relatively weak performance .
wilfried kindermann , born in 1940 , was a member of the team that won the gold medal in the 4x 400-meter relay race in the european athletics championships in 1962 .
today he is one of the germany 's leading sports-medicine authorities .
he has been the chief physician of germany 's national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- for seven olympic games ; chief physician at fifa confederation cup 2005 and soccer world cup 2006 , a member of the medical committee of the european football association -lrb- uefa -rrb- ; deputy chairman of the german football association 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- commission on sports medicine ; internist for the german national football team 1990-2000 ; and member of the scientific advisory committee of the german heart association .
kindermann heads the institute for sports- and preventive medicine at saarland university . oliver samson spoke to wilfried kindermann -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 03.09.2007 german expert : soccer 's popularity explains death rate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statistically speaking , golf and bowling are more dangerous than soccer with the recent heart-attack deaths of two pro soccer players and the near-death of another , watchers of the sport are wondering : just how dangerous is soccer ?
dw-world.de spoke with world cup doctor wilfried kindermann . dw-world.de : professor kindermann , two soccer players died suddenly of heart attacks in recent weeks , and another was just barely saved .
is this coincidence - or is there something more going on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kindermann advises checkups for over-35s wilfried kindermann : above all , i think it is a coincidence .
the fact that soccer is the top sport worldwide adds to the chances : the more people there are playing the sport means there are that many more who can die of a heart attack while playing it .
in the usa , for example , many more athlete deaths take place during basketball and football games .
but if you look at injury and death relative to the number of people who play a given sport , then things look entirely different : relatively mild activities like bowling and golf are at the top of the roster when it comes to sport-related death . but the people who died last week were professionals ; young athletes who were even under medical supervision .
you would think they were particularly healthy , and unlikely to die of a heart attack . yes , there are people who appear healthy , but who either were n't examined at all , or who were n't examined well enough .
these sudden deaths are almost always due to some underlying illness .
in young athletes , for example , there is almost always inborn heart-muscle hypertrophy , malformed coronary arteries , or myocarditis . should the doctors who were supervising these players be accused of not keeping a close enough eye on their charges ? well , first you have to know whether they were examined at all .
hypertrophy can be easily diagnosed with an ultrasound .
in german soccer we have a very good system .
all players in the first and second german soccer leagues have a heart check before each season . everyone knows that doping is particularly damaging to the cardiovascular system .
can we rule out that the two players who died were involved in doping ? doping can , indeed , lead to heart damage - arhythmia , and sudden death from heart attack .
but it is really difficult to test for doping after someone 's death .
in most cases you can rule it out , but you ca n't always prove it after a death .
there were 15 deaths in competitive soccer in the last 10 years .
how many cases are we talking about worldwide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zambia 's chaswe nsofwa died suddenly during a practice session in israel that is an important question , because i would like to make it very clear that the numbers are really quite small .
we think there are some 100,000 sudden heart-attack deaths per year among people active in sports .
any sport that taxes the body is a danger - if the athlete is unhealthy .
if i start doing sports with an undiagnosed heart ailment , i am taking a risk . so if i want to go kick a ball around with my buddies after work tonight , i should go to the doctor first ? after a certain age , you should know about the state of your health .
right now we hold to the basic rule that anyone over 35 should have a checkup if they plan to do sports .
but i have to also make it clear that doing sports , per se , is healthy .
and people who are active have a smaller chance of dying of a heart attack than someone who is not .
in germany there are 100,000 sudden deaths from heart attack each year - and almost none of them have to do with sports . in the 1960s you were a competitive athlete .
were you examined back then ? oh , yes , i can remember it exactly .
i was a 400-meter runner and had to pedal a bicycle ergometer while lying down .
the doctor was surprised by my relatively weak performance .
wilfried kindermann , born in 1940 , was a member of the team that won the gold medal in the 4x 400-meter relay race in the european athletics championships in 1962 .
today he is one of the germany 's leading sports-medicine authorities .
he has been the chief physician of germany 's national olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- for seven olympic games ; chief physician at fifa confederation cup 2005 and soccer world cup 2006 , a member of the medical committee of the european football association -lrb- uefa -rrb- ; deputy chairman of the german football association 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- commission on sports medicine ; internist for the german national football team 1990-2000 ; and member of the scientific advisory committee of the german heart association .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 03.09.2007 experts : uk iraq pullout a prelude to chaos , strained relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that the departing british will leave basra to the gangs and militias british troops withdrew from their basra palace base for the relative safety of their main compound outside the city monday .
defense experts predict chaos and strained relations with the us once they leave iraq for good . after four-and-a-half years of inconclusive combat , british forces completed the last withdrawal of troops from the southern iraqi city of basra on monday .
the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .
there will be no winners , just more losers .
for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .
instead , it marks a refocusing of a small army onto a war that is winnable and more important than iraq .
" the british army is at its smallest since 1842 and is hugely overstretched , " he said .
" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .
many policy experts warn of more chaos ahead .
basra left to the gangs and militias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra has proven particularly hard to control the international crisis group , a think tank specializing in conflict issues , warned in june that the withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the shiite militias who have bombarded british bases daily and control much of the city 's economic and political life .
" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .
giles merritt said he believes that the british have every faith that iraqi forces can handle basra but that how the iraqis react to being in control is impossible to predict .
" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .
" however , the future of basra depends on the different loyalties of the iraqi army .
do they uphold the rule of law or remain loyal to whatever militia they are part of ? "
tensions rise between coalition partners the pullout from basra and the eventual total withdrawal of british troops from iraq in the fall is likely to increase the pressure two-fold on the united states .
the security situation is expected to worsen and if the pentagon makes good on its promise to intervene in southern iraq to quell any unrest in basra , us forces will become even more overstretched .
and , calls both at home and abroad for a complete us withdrawal from iraq will increase .
" the writing has been on the wall for a long time in the us , " merritt added .
" policy makers have been openly talking about running down the commitment and if basra erupts , then it 'll make life a lot harder for the us .
washington is already very concerned but if the south burns it 's hard to believe the us decision will be to send in more troops .
" the us would have much preferred to see the british pull out in six months to a year , " he continued .
" politically , there will be tensions over this especially if the british withdrawal causes major security and policy problems for the us . "
armies trading insults and blame the situation in basra and the decision of the british to begin a phased withdrawal from iraq has also caused rising tensions between the two armies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british blame rumsfeld for the post-invasion chaos general jack keane , a former vice chief-of-staff of the us army , said last month there was " frustration " in washington at the deteriorating security situation in the british-run area .
meanwhile retired major general tim cross , the top british officer involved in planning post-war iraq , hit back , saying he had raised serious concerns with then us defense secretary donald rumsfeld about the possibility of the country descending into chaos but rumsfeld had " ignored " or " dismissed " his warnings .
british general sir mike jackson also branded us post-invasion policy " intellectually bankrupt " and said rumsfeld was " one of the most responsible for the current situation in iraq .

defense experts predict chaos and strained relations with the us once they leave iraq for good . after four-and-a-half years of inconclusive combat , british forces completed the last withdrawal of troops from the southern iraqi city of basra on monday .
the 550 soldiers based at the city 's palace joined the rest of the british contingent at its last remaining base in the country , the heavily fortified compound at the local basra airport outside the city limits .
iraqi troops under the command of general mohan farhad took control of the basra palace base in the early hours of monday morning , although british military sources claimed that an unspecified number of british soldiers remained there .
the sources gave no indication of how long they would stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces take control of the basra palace base the evacuation of the british troops from saddam hussein 's former palace on the banks of the shatt al-arab waterway to the desert airbase is seen as the prelude for a full british handover of security in the region to iraqi authorities .
the total number of british soldiers has already been reduced from 2003 invasion levels of 7,500 to 5,500 .
pm defends withdrawal , denies defeat british prime minister gordon brown defended the withdrawal from basra in a statement following the successful pull-out and stressed that british troops stood ready to " intervene " if the security situation demanded .
the british forces at the palace had become besieged in recent months with almost round-the-clock attacks on the base and attacks on supply convoys attempting to reach the palace from the airbase compound becoming more frequent and severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the withdrawal was pre-planned the prime minister denied that the withdrawal amounted to a defeat for britain , saying it had been planned well in advance .
" let me make this very clear .
this is a pre-planned , organized move , " brown told bbc radio .
" this is essentially a move from where we were in a combat role in four provinces , and now we are moving over time to being in an over-watch role . "
britain focusing on " winnable " war giles merrit , director of the brussels-based defense think-tank security & defense agenda , said that concepts of defeat and victory are irrelevant when talking about iraq .
" there was never going to be a victory in the classic sense , or a defeat , in iraq , " merritt said .
" i think it 's just going to get more and more complicated and things will get tougher for the iraqi people .
there will be no winners , just more losers .
for the british , this withdrawal is just a sign that they are desperately overstretched . "
merritt believes that the withdrawal is neither a snub to the united states over its handling of post-invasion iraq nor a forced retreat .
instead , it marks a refocusing of a small army onto a war that is winnable and more important than iraq .
" the british army is at its smallest since 1842 and is hugely overstretched , " he said .
" it ca n't fight in iraq and afghanistan and it is widely agreed that afghanistan is the war that must be done right . "
if and when british troops turn their attention to afghanistan , they will leave behind a city in the grip of a brutal turf war between rival militia .
many policy experts warn of more chaos ahead .
basra left to the gangs and militias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra has proven particularly hard to control the international crisis group , a think tank specializing in conflict issues , warned in june that the withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the shiite militias who have bombarded british bases daily and control much of the city 's economic and political life .
" basra 's residents and militiamen view this as not an orderly withdrawal but rather as an ignominious defeat .
today , the city is controlled by militias , seemingly more powerful and unconstrained than before , " its report said .
giles merritt said he believes that the british have every faith that iraqi forces can handle basra but that how the iraqis react to being in control is impossible to predict .
" the british have trained these forces so know they have what is needed to cope , " he said .
" however , the future of basra depends on the different loyalties of the iraqi army .
do they uphold the rule of law or remain loyal to whatever militia they are part of ? "
tensions rise between coalition partners the pullout from basra and the eventual total withdrawal of british troops from iraq in the fall is likely to increase the pressure two-fold on the united states .
the security situation is expected to worsen and if the pentagon makes good on its promise to intervene in southern iraq to quell any unrest in basra , us forces will become even more overstretched .
and , calls both at home and abroad for a complete us withdrawal from iraq will increase .
" the writing has been on the wall for a long time in the us , " merritt added .
" policy makers have been openly talking about running down the commitment and if basra erupts , then it 'll make life a lot harder for the us .
washington is already very concerned but if the south burns it 's hard to believe the us decision will be to send in more troops .
" the us would have much preferred to see the british pull out in six months to a year , " he continued .
" politically , there will be tensions over this especially if the british withdrawal causes major security and policy problems for the us . "
armies trading insults and blame the situation in basra and the decision of the british to begin a phased withdrawal from iraq has also caused rising tensions between the two armies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british blame rumsfeld for the post-invasion chaos general jack keane , a former vice chief-of-staff of the us army , said last month there was " frustration " in washington at the deteriorating security situation in the british-run area .
meanwhile retired major general tim cross , the top british officer involved in planning post-war iraq , hit back , saying he had raised serious concerns with then us defense secretary donald rumsfeld about the possibility of the country descending into chaos but rumsfeld had " ignored " or " dismissed " his warnings .
british general sir mike jackson also branded us post-invasion policy " intellectually bankrupt " and said rumsfeld was " one of the most responsible for the current situation in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 03.09.2007 work-shy layabout or laborophobic ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i think i 'm coming down with a nasty case of laborophobia " a german psychiatrist believes that many of the millions who are off work sick may be more than just lazy .
they may be suffering from laborophobia : the fear of work . it is likely there is not one among us who didn ’ t feign a stomach bug or attack of influenza to get out of going to school back in the day .
those old tricks like putting the thermometer on the hot water bottle and rubbing soap on your chest used to work a treat when the fear of an math test or sports day got the better of us .
desperate times called for desperate measures .
how glad we all were when we grew up and never had to face choir practice or spelling bees again .
maturity brought this and other rewards .
school was behind us and we could joyfully enter the world of work - free of those gut-wrenching pangs that had us making fake vomit from custard and baked beans .
at least it was a relief for some .
according to a berlin psychiatrist , not all of us got over the fear .
some out there swapped the angst for school for the angst for work .
these people , says michael linden , head of the psychiatric clinic at berlin 's freie university , are laborophobics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear of work can have very serious effects linden believes that the millions of people who are petrified of their jobs , terrified by their co-workers and who have nightmares about work may be suffering from a genuine medical disorder which doctors have overlooked until now .
far from being work-shy layabouts , these people could be suffering from an irrational fear of work .
what makes laborophobia a genuine work-related phobia rather than just an excuse ?
well , linden believes that it can occur in people who do not suffer from general anxiety disorders , making it unique in the field of phobias .
serious symptoms derived from a fear of work and far from eating specially constructed spicy dishes to bring on diarrhea , laborophobics have very real symptoms which would be enough to get you a whole year off school . " like other forms of anxiety , job anxieties can present in the form of panic , hypochondriac fears , work-related worrying , post-traumatic stress , or work-related social anxieties , " linden wrote in a paper on the phobia .
he says that workers who frequently call in sick or who complain of migraines stemming from their workload could in fact be laborophobic . " anxiety can lead to avoidance .
job anxiety can therefore be one explanation for sick leave , work absenteeism or early retirement , " he says .
paranoia strikes ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bullying is not always left at the school gates such people can also have a paranoid fear that they are being mobbed by co-workers or that their boss is intentionally burdening them with inhuman workloads and impossible deadlines .
they resort to alcohol or medication or seeking sick leave or early retirement .
" job anxieties , therefore , must be considered expensive problems , " warns linden , who is one of germany 's leading experts in chronic depression , phobias and psychosomatic rehabilitation treatments .
he estimates that as many as half of all workers on long-term sick leave may in fact show signs and symptoms of work-related anxiety .

they may be suffering from laborophobia : the fear of work . it is likely there is not one among us who didn ’ t feign a stomach bug or attack of influenza to get out of going to school back in the day .

according to a berlin psychiatrist , not all of us got over the fear .
some out there swapped the angst for school for the angst for work .
these people , says michael linden , head of the psychiatric clinic at berlin 's freie university , are laborophobics .

far from being work-shy layabouts , these people could be suffering from an irrational fear of work .
what makes laborophobia a genuine work-related phobia rather than just an excuse ?

serious symptoms derived from a fear of work and far from eating specially constructed spicy dishes to bring on diarrhea , laborophobics have very real symptoms which would be enough to get you a whole year off school . " like other forms of anxiety , job anxieties can present in the form of panic , hypochondriac fears , work-related worrying , post-traumatic stress , or work-related social anxieties , " linden wrote in a paper on the phobia .
he says that workers who frequently call in sick or who complain of migraines stemming from their workload could in fact be laborophobic . " anxiety can lead to avoidance .
job anxiety can therefore be one explanation for sick leave , work absenteeism or early retirement , " he says .

they resort to alcohol or medication or seeking sick leave or early retirement .
" job anxieties , therefore , must be considered expensive problems , " warns linden , who is one of germany 's leading experts in chronic depression , phobias and psychosomatic rehabilitation treatments .

gdf-suez will become one of europe 's biggest energy conglomerates . french president nicolas sarkozy brokered terms of the deal , which the companies ' boards agreed to late sunday .
the new company , called gdf-suez , will become one of europe 's largest energy conglomerates along with russia 's state-run gazprom , electricite de france and germany 's eon .
the two companies have a combined market value of 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122.8 billion -rrb- although suez will spin off many of its environmental assets , valued by analysts at 18-20 billion euros .
merger of equals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protected from foreign takeover the merger was first conceived 18 months ago , but was delayed by disagreements over valuation and control .
the final agreement will include a share exchange ratio of 0.9545 to 1 , or 21 gaz de france shares for 22 suez shares , the groups said in a joint statement .
sarkozy , who was elected in may and has promised economic reforms , pressured suez to abandon most of its water and waste assets to focus on energy .
besides distributing gas and electricity , suez runs power stations , pumps water and manages waste .
under terms of the deal , suez will divest 65 percent of its environmental activities through a stock market listing , scheduled to take place at the same time as the merger .
unions oppose privatization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big business sarkozy pushed for the merger to prevent a foreign takeover of suez and to strengthen gaz de france 's power assets .
the deal is the latest version of a plan first announced by former prime minister dominique de villepin in early 2006 to protect suez from a possible takeover by italy 's enel .
france 's unions and the socialists have opposed the merger because it would remove the government 's control over gaz de france .
the government owns 80 percent of gaz de france .
finance minister christine lagarde said the government will keep significantly more than a blocking minority of 35 percent .
the combined group will be led by suez chief executive officer gerard mestrallet with the state-owned gas utility 's jean-francois cirelli becoming the vice chairman .
the merged company has set a cost savings target of 1 billion euros by 2013 , according to bloomberg news service .
the transaction to create gdf suez will be completed " as early as possible " in 2008 , the companies said in a statement .
" recent developments in the energy sector reinforced the strategic and industrial logic behind the transaction , " which creates a " global energy leader , " the two companies said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karlsruhe university - one of only three elite universities in germany - has been holding a children 's university every summer for the past five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interactive experiments proved to be a favorite " it 's a good way to introduce children of that age to science and research , " explained organizer margarete lehne over the din of 300 children who were anxiously waiting for the start of a science lecture . " they 're naturally very curious and so we want encourage them to use this natural curiosity to find out how things work . " complicated science as a gong sounded at the front of the lecture theater , the children gradually hushed to listen to professor norbert willenbacher , the head of karlsruhe university 's mechanics department .
willenbacher 's area of speciality is " rheology " - the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of applied stress .
it 's a complicated subject to teach to young children . " you have to avoid using scientific terms , and you have to talk a language which kids can understand , " willenbacher said .
luckily , he has four children at home to keep him in line when it comes to explaining science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching kids about science is important to willenbacher " they 're always telling me : ' be short , be precise , and do n't make it too complicated . '
that 's what i hear all the time when i talk to them about my work and my research , " willenbacher said with a smile . hands-on activities willenbacher packs many experiments into his 45-minute talk .
he shows that liquids can have different viscosity by dropping eggs into beakers of water and oil and getting children to measure the rate of fall .
he gets kids to bang on sauce bottles to explain that even though tomato sauce is a fluid , it only acts like one if force is applied . best of all , dozens of children get to run across a bath filled with rice starch mixed to a pudding-like consistency .
when the children run fast , they stay on the surface .
when they go slowly , they sink into the oozing mass .
this demonstrates that plastic solids can have the properties of liquids under a heavy load .
willenbacher said it was lots of extra work to make his lecture kid-friendly , but it was worth it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children 's university proves science can be fun " i think it 's really part of scientists ' job , " he said .
" i am dedicated to science and i have fun with science , and i want to show this to the children . " popular program more than 5,000 children between the ages of five and 12 regularly come to the children 's university in karlsruhe , attending lectures on subjects ranging from electrical engineering to biology , meteorology , and architecture . eleven-year old theresa has been to all of the lectures offered at there this summer .
she thought willenbacher 's lecture was " fantastic . " " the best thing about it was the experiments because they were fun , " she said .
" at school you always have to be careful , and information is just fed to you - they just tell you stuff .
but here they also did experiments . " according to the organizers , the only real complaints about the children 's university come from the adults who are miffed about having to wait outside .

with eu subsidies due to stop in 2009 , it 's predicted the crop will die out .
and given the current anti-smoking climate , there 's not a lot of sympathy for the farmers . farmer markus fischer is the fourth generation in his family to grow tobacco , and he 'll probably be the last .
about a sixth of his 150-hectare -lrb- 370-acre -rrb- farm in the southern palatinate region of germany is currently dedicated to tobacco , the farm 's main source of income .
but fischer is n't sure what the future holds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tobacco harvest is in full swing tobacco is a highly subsided crop in europe .
farmers earn around 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per kilo , and the eu pays about two euros per kilo on top of that . as part of the eu 's agricultural shake-up , these subsidies will be completely phased out by the end of 2009 , which will probably mean the end for germany 's 450 tobacco growers . " we ca n't cover our overheads without the subsidies , " fischer said . " for the amount we 're currently getting from the buyers , we wo n't be able to keep to producing . " examining other options like other farmers in the region , markus fischer and his family have already started looking into alternatives .

fischer , however , still " hopes to keep growing tobacco , " because that is what he knows best . around 10,000 tons of virginia , burley and geudertheimer tobacco are harvested in germany , europe 's fifth biggest tobacco producer -lrb- italy sits in the number one spot -rrb- . most of germany 's tobacco farmers are based in the southwestern regions of baden and palatinate along the sunny rhine plain stretching from basel to mainz . more than 400 years of history tobacco has a long tradition in the palatinate .
the first recorded mention of the plant goes back to 1573 , when a priest started cultivating it as a medicinal herb .
now , approximately 1,200 hectares of tobacco are grown in the region - a third of germany 's total acreage dedicated to the crop . the plant has left an indelible mark on the area .
not only is the countryside dotted with tobacco fields and drying sheds , there are also frescos on houses depicting the harvest , tobacco sculptures , tobacco fountains , a tobacco museum and even a tobacco cycle path . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tobacco fountain in hexenheim is a reminder of the region 's heritage " if tobacco disappears , as it probably will if the situation does n't change , then we will also loose a part of our cultural tradition in the palatinate , " said jürg bähr , the head of the german tobacco grower 's association . the association is lobbying hard for an extension of the subsidies until 2013 so that the tobacco farmers have more time to convert to other crops . there 's no chance of the eu changing its payments scheme though - the subsidy cut was agreed and signed off on back in 2004 . the only chance for more money is from the federal government , but the current political climate is n't exactly supportive of tobacco . smoking bans federal bans on smoking in public transport , taxis , airports and government offices came into power in germany on sept .

the enp is tailored to create a ring of peaceful and economically advanced states around the eu 's borders , and covers 16 countries , including ukraine , moldova , egypt , algeria , tunisia and israel . countries still have choice in the end , each eu country could choose how many immigrants it is willing to take in , and in which fields they should issue work visas , ferrero-waldner specified . but the new initiative is aimed at widening the scope of the eu 's free movement policy , where citizens in the 27-nation bloc can move between member states . by making it easier to get visas , the plan would increase demographic mobility , ferrero-waldner said . during the latest eu expansion , in 2004 , hundreds of thousands of workers from the 10 central and eastern european countries that joined the union headed to the old eu countries for work . germany seeks engineers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu expansion allowed more migration flexibilty countries like great britain , ireland and sweden opened up their labor markets from the beginning - with positive economic results , early studies show .

' this policy makes us all more secure ' while the enp is high on brussels ' political agenda , it has found less resonance among eu citizens .
a recent poll suggested 54 percent of europeans show little interest in what is happening outside the bloc 's borders , the eu observer reported .

the taxpayers ' alliance said emissions in 2005 had done damage worth an estimated £ 11.7bn , but green taxes and charges in that year had made £ 21.9bn.
it claimed ministers were " cynically " raising revenue rather than using the money to improve the environment .
but the treasury said the pressure group 's claims were " ridiculous " .
' over-paying ' but the taxpayers ' alliance said the £ 11.7bn figure covered the " social cost " of climate change to the world , such as weather changes and related disasters .
it added that uk green taxes should not exceed this figure .
the group also said that , on average , uk households were " over-paying " £ 400 a year .
fuel duty and vehicle excise duty were between 30 and 40 times higher than the level needed to cover estimates of the social cost of co2 emissions . "
green taxes in the uk are already well in excess of the level they need to be to meet the academic estimates of the social costs of carbon emissions " corin taylor taxpayers ' alliance the doubling of air passenger duty , announced in last year 's pre-budget report , was actually likely to have increased total emissions from air travel , creating incentives for longer flights , the report added .
meanwhile , it said the landfill tax was raising up to £ 620m more than was needed to meet the social costs of methane emissions from landfill .
corin taylor , research director of the taxpayers ' alliance , said : " green taxes and charges impose substantial costs on , amongst others , northern manufacturers and the nhs .
" green taxes in the uk are already well in excess of the level they need to be to meet the academic estimates of the social costs of carbon emissions .
' unjustified ' " every household is paying more than £ 400 extra in tax every year because green taxes are set too high .
" uk taxpayers are already more than doing their bit to pay for the costs of pollution and additional green taxes would be completely unjustified . "
but a treasury spokesman said : " the government 's definition of environmental taxes includes those taxes that are designed to primarily have an environmental impact - the climate change levy , aggregates levy and landfill tax . "
in arguing against these taxes , the taxpayers ' alliance are being doubly dangerous - it would mean cuts to public services , schools and hospitals , as well as higher carbon emissions leading to accelerated climate change " treasury spokesman " we make clear , for example , when setting fuel duty rates that the government takes into account a range of factors , including costs of motoring such as congestion , and the need to maintain sound public finances .
" it is ridiculous to argue that the government is failing against its environmental objectives .
the uk is one of a few countries on course to meet its kyoto commitments .
by 2010 we will have met it almost twice over - cutting greenhouse gas emissions by more than 20 % . "

worries about the viability of sub-prime mortgage lending have spread around the financial system , and the central banks have been forced to pump in billions of dollars to oil the wheels of lending .
but what happened in previous financial crises , and what are the lessons for today ?
there have been a growing number of financial crises in the world , according to the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
among the key lessons of previous major financial crises are : globalisation has increased the frequency and spread of financial crises , but not necessarily their severity early intervention by central banks is more effective in limiting their spread than later moves it is difficult to tell at the time whether a financial crisis will have broader economic consequences regulators often can not keep up with the pace of financial innovation that may trigger a crisis .
the dot.com crash , 2000 during the late 1990s , stock markets became beguiled by the rise of internet companies such as amazon and aol , which seemed to be ushering in a new era for the economy .
their shares soared when they listed on the nasdaq stock market , despite that fact that few of the firms actually made a profit .
the boom peaked when internet service provider aol bought traditional media company time warner for nearly $ 200bn in january 2000 .
but in march 2000 , the bubble burst , and the technology-weighted nasdaq index fell by 78 % by october 2002 .
the crash had wider repercussions , with business investment falling and the us economy slowing in the following year , a process exacerbated by the 9/11 attacks , which led to the temporary closure of the financial markets .
but the federal reserve , the us central bank , cut interest rates throughout 2001 , gradually lowering rates from 6.25 % to 1 % to stimulate economic growth .
long-term capital management , 1998 the collapse of hedge fund long-term capital market -lrb- ltcm -rrb- occurred during the final stage of the world financial crisis that began in asia in 1997 and spread to russia and brazil in 1998 .
ltcm was a hedge fund set up by nobel prize winners myron scholes and robert merton to trade bonds .
the professors believed that in the long run , the interest rates on different government bonds would converge , and the hedge fund traded on the small differences in the rates .
but when russia defaulted on its government bonds in august 1998 , investors fled from other government paper to the safe haven of us treasury bonds , and interest rate differences between bonds increased sharply .
ltcm , which had borrowed a lot of money from other companies , stood to lose billions of dollars - and in order to liquidate its positions it would have to sell treasury bonds , plunging the us credit markets into turmoil and forcing up interest rates .
so the fed decided that a rescue was needed .
it called together the leading us banks , many of whom had invested in ltcm , and persuaded them to put in $ 3.65bn to save the firm from imminent collapse .
the fed itself made an emergency rate cut in october 1998 and markets soon returned to stability .
ltcm itself was liquidated in 2000 .
the crash of 1987 us stock markets suffered their largest peacetime one-day fall yet on 19 october 1987 , when the dow jones industrial average index of shares in leading us companies dropped 22 % and european and japanese markets followed suit .
the losses were triggered by the widespread belief that insider trading and company takeovers on borrowed money were dominating the markets , while the us economy was entering into an economic slowdown .
there were also worries about the value of the us dollar , which had been declining on international markets .
these fears grew when germany raised a key interest rate , boosting the value of its currency .
newly-introduced computerised trading systems exacerbated the stock market declines , as sell orders were executed automatically .
concerns that major banks might go bust led the fed and other major central banks to lower interest rates sharply .
" circuit-breakers " were also introduced to limit program trading and allow the authorities to suspend all trades for short periods .
the crash seemed to have little direct economic effect and stock markets soon recovered .
but the lower interest rates , especially in the uk , may have contributed to the housing market bubble of 1988-89 and to the pressures on the pound sterling which led to the devaluation of 1992 .
the crash also showed that global stock markets were now closely linked , and changes in economic policy in one country could affect markets around the world .
laws on insider trading were also tightened up in the us and uk .
us savings and loan scandal , 1985 us savings and loans institutions were local banks which made home loans and took deposits from retail investors , similar to building societies in the uk .
under financial deregulation in the 1980s , they were allowed to engage in more complex , and often unwise , financial transactions , competing with the big commercial banks .
by 1985 , many of these institutions were all but bankrupt , and a run began on s & l institutions in ohio and maryland .
the us government insured many of the individual deposits in the s & ls , and therefore had a big financial liability when they collapsed .
it set up the resolution trust company to take over and sell any s & l assets that it could , including repossessed homes , taking over the bankrupt institutions .
the cost of the bail-out eventually totalled about $ 150bn .
however , the crisis probably strengthened the bigger banks by weeding out their weaker rivals , and laid the groundwork for the wave of mergers and consolidations in the retail banking sector in the 1990s .
the crash of 1929 the wall street crash of 1929 , " black thursday , " was an event that sent the us and indeed the global economy into a tailspin , contributing to the great depression of the 1930s .
after a huge speculative rise in the late 1920s , based partly on the rise of new industries such as radio broadcasting and carmaking , shares fell by 13 % on thursday , 24 october .
despite efforts by the stock market authorities to stabilise the market , stocks fell by another 11 % the following tuesday , 29 october .
by the time the market had reached bottom in 1932 , 90 % had been wiped off the value of shares .
it took 25 years before the dow jones industrial average recovered to its 1929 level .
the effect on the real economy was severe , as widespread share ownership meant that the losses were felt by many middle-class consumers .
they cut their purchases of big consumer goods such as cars and homes , while businesses postponed investment and closed factories .
by 1932 , the us economy had declined by half , and one-third of the workforce was unemployed .
the whole us financial system also went into meltdown , with a shutdown of the entire banking system in march 1933 by the time the new president , franklin roosevelt took office and launched the new deal .
many economists on both left and right have criticised the response of the authorities as inadequate .
the us central bank actually raised interest rates to protect the value of the dollar and preserve the gold standard , while the us government raised tariffs and ran a budget surplus .
new deal measures alleviated some of the worst problems of the depression , but the us economy did not fully recover until world war ii , when massive military spending eliminated unemployment and boosted growth .
the new deal also introduced extensive regulation of financial markets and the banking system through the creation of the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- and the federal deposit insurance corporation -lrb- fdic -rrb- , and the separation of commercial and retail banking through the glass-steagall act .
overend & gurney , 1866 ; barings , 1890 the failure of a key london bank in 1866 led to a key change in the role of central banks in managing financial crises .
overend and gurney was a discount bank which provided money for commercial and retail banks in london , the world 's financial centre .
when it declared bankruptcy in may 1866 , many smaller banks were unable to get funds and went under , even though they were otherwise solvent .
as a result , reformers like walter bagehot advocated a new role for the bank of england as the " lender of last resort " to provide liquidity -lrb- cash -rrb- to the financial system during crises , in order to prevent a failure of one bank spilling over and affect all the others -lrb- " systemic failure " -rrb- .
the new doctrine was implemented in the barings crisis in 1890 , when losses by a leading uk bank , barings , made on its investments in argentina , were covered by the bank of england to prevent a systemic collapse of uk banking .
secret negotiations by the bank and london financiers led to the creation of an £ 18m rescue fund in november 1890 , before the extent of barings ' losses became publicly known .
the bankers also organised a committee to renegotiate the outstanding debts owed by argentina , but a banking crisis engulfed the country and foreign lending to argentina dried up for a decade .

the bank of england was at the centre of the world financial system overend and gurney was a discount bank which provided money for commercial and retail banks in london , the world 's financial centre .
when it declared bankruptcy in may 1866 , many smaller banks were unable to get funds and went under , even though they were otherwise solvent .
as a result , reformers like walter bagehot advocated a new role for the bank of england as the " lender of last resort " to provide liquidity -lrb- cash -rrb- to the financial system during crises , in order to prevent a failure of one bank spilling over and affect all the others -lrb- " systemic failure " -rrb- .
the new doctrine was implemented in the barings crisis in 1890 , when losses by a leading uk bank , barings , made on its investments in argentina , were covered by the bank of england to prevent a systemic collapse of uk banking .
secret negotiations by the bank and london financiers led to the creation of an £ 18m rescue fund in november 1890 , before the extent of barings ' losses became publicly known .
the bankers also organised a committee to renegotiate the outstanding debts owed by argentina , but a banking crisis engulfed the country and foreign lending to argentina dried up for a decade .

worries about the viability of sub-prime mortgage lending have spread around the financial system , and the central banks have been forced to pump in billions of dollars to oil the wheels of lending .
but what happened in previous financial crises , and what are the lessons for today ?
there have been a growing number of financial crises in the world , according to the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
among the key lessons of previous major financial crises are : globalisation has increased the frequency and spread of financial crises , but not necessarily their severity early intervention by central banks is more effective in limiting their spread than later moves it is difficult to tell at the time whether a financial crisis will have broader economic consequences regulators often can not keep up with the pace of financial innovation that may trigger a crisis .
the dot.com crash , 2000 during the late 1990s , stock markets became beguiled by the rise of internet companies such as amazon and aol , which seemed to be ushering in a new era for the economy .
when aol 's steve case took over time warner , the dot.com boom peaked their shares soared when they listed on the nasdaq stock market , despite that fact that few of the firms actually made a profit .
the boom peaked when internet service provider aol bought traditional media company time warner for nearly $ 200bn in january 2000 .
but in march 2000 , the bubble burst , and the technology-weighted nasdaq index fell by 78 % by october 2002 .
the crash had wider repercussions , with business investment falling and the us economy slowing in the following year , a process exacerbated by the 9/11 attacks , which led to the temporary closure of the financial markets .
but the federal reserve , the us central bank , cut interest rates throughout 2001 , gradually lowering rates from 6.25 % to 1 % to stimulate economic growth .
long-term capital management , 1998 the collapse of hedge fund long-term capital market -lrb- ltcm -rrb- occurred during the final stage of the world financial crisis that began in asia in 1997 and spread to russia and brazil in 1998 .
ltcm was a hedge fund set up by nobel prize winners myron scholes and robert merton to trade bonds .
the professors believed that in the long run , the interest rates on different government bonds would converge , and the hedge fund traded on the small differences in the rates .
john meriwether , a wall street trader , headed ltcm but when russia defaulted on its government bonds in august 1998 , investors fled from other government paper to the safe haven of us treasury bonds , and interest rate differences between bonds increased sharply .
ltcm , which had borrowed a lot of money from other companies , stood to lose billions of dollars - and in order to liquidate its positions it would have to sell treasury bonds , plunging the us credit markets into turmoil and forcing up interest rates .
so the fed decided that a rescue was needed .
it called together the leading us banks , many of whom had invested in ltcm , and persuaded them to put in $ 3.65bn to save the firm from imminent collapse .
the fed itself made an emergency rate cut in october 1998 and markets soon returned to stability .
ltcm itself was liquidated in 2000 .
the crash of 1987 us stock markets suffered their largest peacetime one-day fall yet on 19 october 1987 , when the dow jones industrial average index of shares in leading us companies dropped 22 % and european and japanese markets followed suit .
program trading on the new york stock market worsened the crisis the losses were triggered by the widespread belief that insider trading and company takeovers on borrowed money were dominating the markets , while the us economy was entering into an economic slowdown .
there were also worries about the value of the us dollar , which had been declining on international markets .
these fears grew when germany raised a key interest rate , boosting the value of its currency .
newly-introduced computerised trading systems exacerbated the stock market declines , as sell orders were executed automatically .
concerns that major banks might go bust led the fed and other major central banks to lower interest rates sharply .
" circuit-breakers " were also introduced to limit program trading and allow the authorities to suspend all trades for short periods .
the crash seemed to have little direct economic effect and stock markets soon recovered .
but the lower interest rates , especially in the uk , may have contributed to the housing market bubble of 1988-89 and to the pressures on the pound sterling which led to the devaluation of 1992 .
the crash also showed that global stock markets were now closely linked , and changes in economic policy in one country could affect markets around the world .
laws on insider trading were also tightened up in the us and uk .
us savings and loan scandal , 1985 us savings and loans institutions were local banks which made home loans and took deposits from retail investors , similar to building societies in the uk .
under financial deregulation in the 1980s , they were allowed to engage in more complex , and often unwise , financial transactions , competing with the big commercial banks .
by 1985 , many of these institutions were all but bankrupt , and a run began on s & l institutions in ohio and maryland .
the us government insured many of the individual deposits in the s & ls , and therefore had a big financial liability when they collapsed .
it set up the resolution trust company to take over and sell any s & l assets that it could , including repossessed homes , taking over the bankrupt institutions .
the cost of the bail-out eventually totalled about $ 150bn .
however , the crisis probably strengthened the bigger banks by weeding out their weaker rivals , and laid the groundwork for the wave of mergers and consolidations in the retail banking sector in the 1990s .
the crash of 1929 the wall street crash of 1929 , " black thursday , " was an event that sent the us and indeed the global economy into a tailspin , contributing to the great depression of the 1930s .
franklin roosevelt became us president after the crash after a huge speculative rise in the late 1920s , based partly on the rise of new industries such as radio broadcasting and carmaking , shares fell by 13 % on thursday , 24 october .
despite efforts by the stock market authorities to stabilise the market , stocks fell by another 11 % the following tuesday , 29 october .
by the time the market had reached bottom in 1932 , 90 % had been wiped off the value of shares .
it took 25 years before the dow jones industrial average recovered to its 1929 level .
the effect on the real economy was severe , as widespread share ownership meant that the losses were felt by many middle-class consumers .
they cut their purchases of big consumer goods such as cars and homes , while businesses postponed investment and closed factories .
by 1932 , the us economy had declined by half , and one-third of the workforce was unemployed .
the whole us financial system also went into meltdown , with a shutdown of the entire banking system in march 1933 by the time the new president , franklin roosevelt took office and launched the new deal .
many economists on both left and right have criticised the response of the authorities as inadequate .
the us central bank actually raised interest rates to protect the value of the dollar and preserve the gold standard , while the us government raised tariffs and ran a budget surplus .
new deal measures alleviated some of the worst problems of the depression , but the us economy did not fully recover until world war ii , when massive military spending eliminated unemployment and boosted growth .
the new deal also introduced extensive regulation of financial markets and the banking system through the creation of the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- and the federal deposit insurance corporation -lrb- fdic -rrb- , and the separation of commercial and retail banking through the glass-steagall act .

the effect on the real economy was severe , as widespread share ownership meant that the losses were felt by many middle-class consumers .
they cut their purchases of big consumer goods such as cars and homes , while businesses postponed investment and closed factories .
by 1932 , the us economy had declined by half , and one-third of the workforce was unemployed .
the whole us financial system also went into meltdown , with a shutdown of the entire banking system in march 1933 by the time the new president , franklin roosevelt took office and launched the new deal .
many economists on both left and right have criticised the response of the authorities as inadequate .
the us central bank actually raised interest rates to protect the value of the dollar and preserve the gold standard , while the us government raised tariffs and ran a budget surplus .
new deal measures alleviated some of the worst problems of the depression , but the us economy did not fully recover until world war ii , when massive military spending eliminated unemployment and boosted growth .
the new deal also introduced extensive regulation of financial markets and the banking system through the creation of the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- and the federal deposit insurance corporation -lrb- fdic -rrb- , and the separation of commercial and retail banking through the glass-steagall act .
overend & gurney , 1866 ; barings , 1890 the failure of a key london bank in 1866 led to a key change in the role of central banks in managing financial crises .
the bank of england was at the centre of the world financial system overend and gurney was a discount bank which provided money for commercial and retail banks in london , the world 's financial centre .
when it declared bankruptcy in may 1866 , many smaller banks were unable to get funds and went under , even though they were otherwise solvent .
as a result , reformers like walter bagehot advocated a new role for the bank of england as the " lender of last resort " to provide liquidity -lrb- cash -rrb- to the financial system during crises , in order to prevent a failure of one bank spilling over and affect all the others -lrb- " systemic failure " -rrb- .
the new doctrine was implemented in the barings crisis in 1890 , when losses by a leading uk bank , barings , made on its investments in argentina , were covered by the bank of england to prevent a systemic collapse of uk banking .
secret negotiations by the bank and london financiers led to the creation of an £ 18m rescue fund in november 1890 , before the extent of barings ' losses became publicly known .
the bankers also organised a committee to renegotiate the outstanding debts owed by argentina , but a banking crisis engulfed the country and foreign lending to argentina dried up for a decade .

all sorts of technical problems on the night and into the next morning .
and by the end of a long , long election night , 146,000 rejected ballots .
exactly four months on from the holyrood elections , a picture has emerged of an electoral ' perfect storm ' where every element conspired to confuse .
there were two elections on the same day - one for holyrood , the other for local councils .
two different voting systems , one of them completely new .
one new ballot paper , the other redesigned to replace two old ones .
two crosses on one ballot paper , numbers on the other .
and everything counted by machine instead of by hand .
auto-adjudicate the enduring image was of candidates and agents scrutinising screens showing the rejected ballots , ready to challenge the decisions of the returning officers and their staffs .
but what they saw was not all they got .
the assumption may have been that every ballot would be adjudicated by a human being - but that 's not what happened .
we have established that the e-counting machines were set to auto-adjudicate - to reject certain types of ballots automatically .
they never appeared on the screens to be challenged by the parties .
they were never adjudicated by the returning officer .
indeed , the last human beings to set eyes on those rejected ballots were the voters who had cast them .
i think it 's really important we get to the bottom of this alex salmond first minister then the machines took over .
it is not just the parties and candidates who did n't know this was going on - never mind the voters .
some of the returning officers did n't know either .
there were circumstances in which the machines would have thought they saw a holyrood ballot paper with a cross in one column but apparently no mark in the other .
the machine , set to auto-adjudicate , would count the good vote .
it would then reject the other one and automatically put the ballot paper in the pile alongside all the correctly-completed ballots .
in some contests that process meant more than half of all the rejected ballots were rejected automatically .
there is no evidence it affected the overall result .
on the other hand , there has been no human check that the machines got every single rejection right - or if not , how many they got wrong .
and this was a squeakingly tight election : the snp emerged as the biggest party by a single seat .
no fewer than 16 msps have been elected with majorities that are smaller than the number of rejected ballots in their contest .
democratic election there 's also the bigger question of what this does to the public 's already battered confidence in electronic counting .
this was a democratic election in which even the candidates , never mind the voters , were not told that machines would be deciding whether thousands of votes would be rejected .
the scotland office , which had responsibility for the holyrood elections , say there is no evidence to suggest the auto-adjudication caused any of the problems for voters .
but first minister alex salmond told bbc scotland that he was astonished .
he said : " i was under the impression - until this revelation - that the ballots that were rejected were actually seen by the election agents as part of the process .
" that was my understanding .
i think that 's deeply disturbing .

new research for leading charity help the aged suggests that more than 250,000 older people in northern ireland think ageism should be banned .
the charity wants the assembly to put ageism on the same footing as racism and sexism .
a spokesman said ageist attitudes were a " blight " affecting health care , insurance and how people are addressed .
about 50 % of those interviewed felt they suffered discrimination from health professionals and care services .
they said some doctors dismissed their symptoms as " just old age " and 54 % felt there was little dignity for older people in hospitals or care homes .
we live in a society where racism and sexism are not tolerated , yet age prejudice is tolerated and even accepted duane farrell help the aged the survey , carried out by icm , interviewed a random sample of 1,321 adults aged 60 and over across the uk .
duane farrell , head of policy , research and communications at help the aged northern ireland , said ageist attitudes were " a daily blight " on people 's lives .
" we live in a society where racism and sexism are not tolerated , yet age prejudice is tolerated and even accepted , " he said .
" unfair treatment wears people down .
ageist attitudes and practices are a daily blight on older people 's lives , affecting the type of care they receive , the insurance options available to them and even the way they are spoken to . "

it is an almost exclusively ultra-orthodox jewish enclave , its narrow streets and crowded apartments teeming with thousands of black-hatted , white-shirted haredi men and their families .
the haredim live in a world apart from modern , westernised west jerusalem , devoting their lives to the study of jewish law and thought , practising what they see as the purest form of judaism .
it is widely accepted that palestinian population growth in israel and the occupied territories is a major strategic issue for israel .
but the proportion of ultra-orthodox haredi jews is also growing , approximately three times as fast as the rest of the population .
in a country where every 18-year-old jew is supposed to join the army - and which has faced six major conflicts with its neighbours and battled two palestinian uprisings - that haredi population growth poses some urgent questions .
spiritual needs the ultra-orthodox do not face compulsory conscription ; they are exempted from national service in order to continue their religious studies .
once it was a tiny minority which took that route ; now they account for more than 10 % of draft-age israeli jews .
by 2019 , the government forecasts they will constitute almost one in four .
former deputy prime minister yosef lapid represents a constituency in israel that asks whether haredi behaviour is not in fact undermining the jewish state .
" i have nothing against them because they are religious , " says mr lapid .
" i very much oppose the fact that they do n't serve in the army .
they represent god in god 's country , but do n't defend god 's country " .
from the yeshivas , or theological colleges , around jerusalem , where the young men sway back and forth as they read and debate centuries of law and commentary , there is a different view .
they believe that the country has spiritual as well as physical needs , and there is no greater service than that of religious study .
" the difficulty a secular israeli is going to have is just not understanding the whole world-view that the religious world is coming from , " says haredi rabbi moshe zeldman .
" if you look at the whole history of the jewish people , it ca n't be explained in physical terms .
what made us survive this long ?
we really believe god has a hand in history , " he says .
welfare rabbi zeldman says he is not living in a dreamland , where only god takes care of the jews and israel does not need an army .
" you also need a balance .
and the balance has to be that as much as you 're worried about your physical survival , you 're also focussed on your spiritual survival , " he says .
but there is a further source of tension - the economy .
at a food distribution scheme in mea shearim , dozens of families come to collect cardboard boxes full of all types of kosher food .
this is not an unusual sight , because most haredim are poor and many rely heavily on welfare .
government figures suggest that two out of three haredi men do not have a paid job .
more and more , israelis are asking if this too can carry on .
demographer mencahem friedman says that either the haredim will have to change their ways or " the government will force them " to contribute more to the economy and defence .
" to keep the status quo as it is now probably will not be possible , " he says .
" everyone has to make a very crucial decision to change the situation .
how they will make it , i do n't know . "
it is one of the most difficult questions of all for israel - what a jewish state should demand of its own jewish citizens .

haredi life is devoted to studying jewish law and thought it is an almost exclusively ultra-orthodox jewish enclave , its narrow streets and crowded apartments teeming with thousands of black-hatted , white-shirted haredi men and their families .
the haredim live in a world apart from modern , westernised west jerusalem , devoting their lives to the study of jewish law and thought , practising what they see as the purest form of judaism .
it is widely accepted that palestinian population growth in israel and the occupied territories is a major strategic issue for israel .
but the proportion of ultra-orthodox haredi jews is also growing , approximately three times as fast as the rest of the population .
in a country where every 18-year-old jew is supposed to join the army - and which has faced six major conflicts with its neighbours and battled two palestinian uprisings - that haredi population growth poses some urgent questions .
spiritual needs the ultra-orthodox do not face compulsory conscription ; they are exempted from national service in order to continue their religious studies .
secular israelis see the army as the state 's most important institution once it was a tiny minority which took that route ; now they account for more than 10 % of draft-age israeli jews .
by 2019 , the government forecasts they will constitute almost one in four .
former deputy prime minister yosef lapid represents a constituency in israel that asks whether haredi behaviour is not in fact undermining the jewish state .
" i have nothing against them because they are religious , " says mr lapid .
" i very much oppose the fact that they do n't serve in the army .
they represent god in god 's country , but do n't defend god 's country " .
from the yeshivas , or theological colleges , around jerusalem , where the young men sway back and forth as they read and debate centuries of law and commentary , there is a different view .
they believe that the country has spiritual as well as physical needs , and there is no greater service than that of religious study .
" the difficulty a secular israeli is going to have is just not understanding the whole world-view that the religious world is coming from , " says haredi rabbi moshe zeldman .
" if you look at the whole history of the jewish people , it ca n't be explained in physical terms .
what made us survive this long ?
we really believe god has a hand in history , " he says .
welfare rabbi zeldman says he is not living in a dreamland , where only god takes care of the jews and israel does not need an army .
the haredi issue will become more central as the population grows " you also need a balance .
and the balance has to be that as much as you 're worried about your physical survival , you 're also focussed on your spiritual survival , " he says .
but there is a further source of tension - the economy .
at a food distribution scheme in mea shearim , dozens of families come to collect cardboard boxes full of all types of kosher food .
this is not an unusual sight , because most haredim are poor and many rely heavily on welfare .
government figures suggest that two out of three haredi men do not have a paid job .
more and more , israelis are asking if this too can carry on .
demographer mencahem friedman says that either the haredim will have to change their ways or " the government will force them " to contribute more to the economy and defence .
" to keep the status quo as it is now probably will not be possible , " he says .
" everyone has to make a very crucial decision to change the situation .
how they will make it , i do n't know . "
it is one of the most difficult questions of all for israel - what a jewish state should demand of its own jewish citizens .

it is not unusual to hear shop owners complaining about the weather , and sometimes the climate can seem like a easy excuse for their own shortcomings .
but when it comes to mobile retailers , whose customers ' battles against the elements this summer have been particularly acute , it is hard not to have some sympathy .
" too wet and the crowds do n't turn out , too hot and people do n't want to carry food around , " says jane taylor , co-founder of the yorkshire dales cheese company , who has been exhibiting her products at more than 25 country shows and food festivals this summer .
one of the wettest summers in recent history has taken its toll on many retailers .
but for those without high street stores to fall back on , it has been a special headache .
" cancellations have been a big problem this year - particularly for traders who had invested in large amounts of stock , " ms taylor adds .
" in addition , refunds for stand costs paid in advance have not always been forthcoming . "
location , location , location " trailer retailers " are now spoilt for choice about where to sell their wares , with thousands of festivals and sporting events across the uk offering an ideal showcase for them .
but when the conditions turn ugly , as they did at royal ascot , wimbledon and glastonbury , firms can be forgiven for hoping the muddy ground will open and swallow them up .
" for the first three days of a show you are trying to cover your costs , " says robin west , co-owner of the traditional pasty and pie company .
" when you get to the last day , you go into profit mode .
there are times when you wo n't manage it .
it is as simple as that . "
" we make sure we are not just selling something but serving the customer with something they will enjoy .
a good caterer will make something with love " robin west , traditional pasty & pie company mr west can be found selling his freshly-made cornish pasties and organic coffee at high-profile events in the sporting and business calendar including cowes week , the farnborough air show , the grand national and glorious goodwood .
this may sound like a great way of touring the country and soaking up the atmosphere of a english summer but , in reality , it is extremely tough and commercially risky work .
racecourses charge retailers a flat fee of between £ 1,000 and £ 2,000 for a small pitch during a prestigious meeting while some music festivals ask five times that amount .
things can quickly unravel - as happened one day at this year 's glorious goodwood race meeting , when mr west made a loss on the day 's trade .
" if you are in the wrong position on a racecourse , you can haemorrhage money , " he says , echoing the old mantra that location is everything .
health and safety while some retailers make handsome money out of sporting events and festivals , the odds seem increasingly stacked against many businesses .
before rent payments are due , there are travel and accommodation costs to pay - and these quickly add up .
the cost of energy , vital to a business like traditional pasty & pie which uses air conditioning to make its puff pastry , has soared in recent years .
" gas and electricity costs have gone through the roof , " says mr west .
" it is a necessary evil that we are dealing with all the time . "
most punitive , however , is the cost of complying with stringent healthy and safety regulations - which must be met every time a retailer sets up shop somewhere .
retailers like mr west are well-used to dealing with council officers , gas safety inspectors and other officials , and he says there is an " understandable " pre-occupation with upholding standards and doing everything possible to prevent the risk of food poisoning .
at the same time , he is frustrated about the escalating cost of red tape .
he believes this plays into the hands of firms not concerned with offering value for money : those he says are happy to charge more than £ 5 for a plain hamburger in a cheap bun .
" we are not after the ' one-hit wonder ' but after continuity , " he says , insisting that meeting customers ' rising culinary expectations is essential to building brand loyalty .
" but the list of expenditure on infrastructure and having to conform with rules and regulations for food and hygiene and safety just goes on . "
private route one way of reducing red tape and keeping costs down is to focus on private customers : the route taken by morfudd richards with her mobile ice cream service lolas on ice .
a former top london chef , she sold her restaurant in 2005 and is now making deluxe , organic ice creams for weddings , private parties and business functions .
" people want me to be outside the church or as a substitute for desert , " she says , adding that she has been " incredibly lucky " with the weather this summer .
although the business has its limitations - she will not take her van on trips of more than 40 miles outside london - she believes she has found a niche in the market , and one not requiring her to work an 80-hour week and manage 20 staff .
" if i was really business-minded , i could probably franchise it , " she says of the concept .
" i think there is a lot of potential in setting up a business based on having your own van , making ice-creams and taking them to parties . "
do n't mention the shop mobile retailing may once have been cheaper than running a shop , but times have changed .
robin west believes the costs are pretty much the same these days , and this explains the increasingly high turnover of operators at festivals and sporting events .
" if you look at ebay , you see a lot of mobile trailers for sale , " he says .
" many people come into the industry , flash through and get out .
they get into trouble and start trying to sell their stock cheaply . "
the nation 's motorways and b-roads may not be paved with gold for most mobile retailers .
but they are doing a job they enjoy and getting satisfaction from keeping customers happy .
" we make sure we are not just selling something but serving the customer with something they will enjoy , " mr west concludes .
" a good caterer will make something with love . "

but when it comes to mobile retailers , whose customers ' battles against the elements this summer have been particularly acute , it is hard not to have some sympathy .
" too wet and the crowds do n't turn out , too hot and people do n't want to carry food around , " says jane taylor , co-founder of the yorkshire dales cheese company , who has been exhibiting her products at more than 25 country shows and food festivals this summer .
one of the wettest summers in recent history has taken its toll on many retailers .
but for those without high street stores to fall back on , it has been a special headache .
" cancellations have been a big problem this year - particularly for traders who had invested in large amounts of stock , " ms taylor adds .
" in addition , refunds for stand costs paid in advance have not always been forthcoming . "
location , location , location " trailer retailers " are now spoilt for choice about where to sell their wares , with thousands of festivals and sporting events across the uk offering an ideal showcase for them .
but when the conditions turn ugly , as they did at royal ascot , wimbledon and glastonbury , firms can be forgiven for hoping the muddy ground will open and swallow them up .
" for the first three days of a show you are trying to cover your costs , " says robin west , co-owner of the traditional pasty and pie company .
" when you get to the last day , you go into profit mode .
there are times when you wo n't manage it .
it is as simple as that . "
we make sure we are not just selling something but serving the customer with something they will enjoy .
a good caterer will make something with love robin west , traditional pasty & pie company mr west can be found selling his freshly-made cornish pasties and organic coffee at high-profile events in the sporting and business calendar including cowes week , the farnborough air show , the grand national and glorious goodwood .
this may sound like a great way of touring the country and soaking up the atmosphere of a english summer but , in reality , it is extremely tough and commercially risky work .
racecourses charge retailers a flat fee of between £ 1,000 and £ 2,000 for a small pitch during a prestigious meeting while some music festivals ask five times that amount .
things can quickly unravel - as happened one day at this year 's glorious goodwood race meeting , when mr west made a loss on the day 's trade .
" if you are in the wrong position on a racecourse , you can haemorrhage money , " he says , echoing the old mantra that location is everything .
health and safety while some retailers make handsome money out of sporting events and festivals , the odds seem increasingly stacked against many businesses .
before rent payments are due , there are travel and accommodation costs to pay - and these quickly add up .
the cost of energy , vital to a business like traditional pasty & pie which uses air conditioning to make its puff pastry , has soared in recent years .
" gas and electricity costs have gone through the roof , " says mr west .
" it is a necessary evil that we are dealing with all the time . "
being in the right location is of paramount importance to all firms most punitive , however , is the cost of complying with stringent healthy and safety regulations - which must be met every time a retailer sets up shop somewhere .
retailers like mr west are well-used to dealing with council officers , gas safety inspectors and other officials , and he says there is an " understandable " pre-occupation with upholding standards and doing everything possible to prevent the risk of food poisoning .
at the same time , he is frustrated about the escalating cost of red tape .
he believes this plays into the hands of firms not concerned with offering value for money : those he says are happy to charge more than £ 5 for a plain hamburger in a cheap bun .
" we are not after the ' one-hit wonder ' but after continuity , " he says , insisting that meeting customers ' rising culinary expectations is essential to building brand loyalty .
" but the list of expenditure on infrastructure and having to conform with rules and regulations for food and hygiene and safety just goes on . "
private route one way of reducing red tape and keeping costs down is to focus on private customers : the route taken by morfudd richards with her mobile ice cream service lolas on ice .
a former top london chef , she sold her restaurant in 2005 and is now making deluxe , organic ice creams for weddings , private parties and business functions .
" people want me to be outside the church or as a substitute for desert , " she says , adding that she has been " incredibly lucky " with the weather this summer .
although the business has its limitations - she will not take her van on trips of more than 40 miles outside london - she believes she has found a niche in the market , and one not requiring her to work an 80-hour week and manage 20 staff .
" if i was really business-minded , i could probably franchise it , " she says of the concept .
" i think there is a lot of potential in setting up a business based on having your own van , making ice-creams and taking them to parties . "
do n't mention the shop mobile retailing may once have been cheaper than running a shop , but times have changed .
robin west believes the costs are pretty much the same these days , and this explains the increasingly high turnover of operators at festivals and sporting events .
there are some advantages in not having to mind the shop every day " if you look at ebay , you see a lot of mobile trailers for sale , " he says .
" many people come into the industry , flash through and get out .
they get into trouble and start trying to sell their stock cheaply . "
the nation 's motorways and b-roads may not be paved with gold for most mobile retailers .
but they are doing a job they enjoy and getting satisfaction from keeping customers happy .
" we make sure we are not just selling something but serving the customer with something they will enjoy , " mr west concludes .
" a good caterer will make something with love . "
