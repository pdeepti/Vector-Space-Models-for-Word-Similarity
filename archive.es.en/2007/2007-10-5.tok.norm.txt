those polled said they supported minimum wage requirements , better unemployment benefits and fewer taxes . the survey , conducted at the beginning of october , was commissioned by the public broadcaster ard .
a full 78 percent of german voters who were questioned said they had not profited from germany 's good economic times .
germany has been on an economic upswing for the past two years , with a predicted growth rate in 2007 of 2.5 percent .
unemployment in germany was 8.4 percent in september , the lowest it has been in the past 12 years .
yet despite the good economic times , germans seem relatively pessimistic about their personal gain .
while a majority of people across age , occupational and income groups said they had not benefited from the economic boom , the feeling was especially strong among low-income earners .
nine of 10 people with a household income under 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,116 -rrb- per month felt left out of the boom .
among families who made more than 3,000 euros per month , 48 percent thought that they had indeed done well for themselves during the economic good times .
in eastern germany people were more likely to have been unhappy with their personal gains -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- than in western germany -lrb- 77 percent -rrb- .
not seeing the benefits of the boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left out of the economic boom this survey comes on the heels of two recent reports which showed that german workers are not a happy bunch .
a report released by the bild newspaper in september showed that net salaries of german workers were at their lowest point in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros , the newspaper said , citing government figures .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
additionally , a survey in september commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation , found that one of three employees in germany believes it wo n't be possible to continue working until reaching retirement age .
only every eighth worker surveyed is happy with his job and working conditions .
respondents think the government could do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many taxes , many said respondents were asked what measures the german government could take to improve equality between the rich and poor .
some 85 percent supported improving unemployment benefits for those people who have worked and paid into the social security system .
seven out of 10 said they support a minimum wage .
germany 's ruling left-right coalition recently agreed to set a minimum wage for postal workers .
but the coalition ca n't agree on whether to institute a general minimum wage or limit it to certain industrial sectors .

5 , in a strike over wages .
despite contingency plans , delays were reported during the morning commute . train drivers went on a three-hour strike across germany starting at 8 a.m.
friday morning , complicating the morning commute .
in some german cities , such as stuttgart , two commuter train lines had been closed for lack of drivers and many regional trains had also been either delayed or cancelled .
in other cities , strike contingency plans put into place by germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn kept trains running , although less frequently .
the contingency plans aimed to keep half of the country 's 19,000 regional trains and two of every three long-distance trains operating , according to a deutsche bahn spokesman .
some drivers are not members of the union , allowing deutsche bahn to staff some of its most important commuter routes .
in germany 's industrial heartland of north rhine-westphalia , commuters seemed to have taken other modes of transportation .
commuter trains in essen , bochum and dortmund were relatively empty as the strike got underway friday morning .
drawn-out wage dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for a connection deutsche bahn has been in a months-long wage dispute with the german train drivers ' union , gdl .
the union says its members are underpaid when compared with train drivers elsewhere in europe .
in june , two larger unions representing 134,000 workers launched a series of small strikes .
deutsche bahn eventually agreed to give them an inflation-beating 4.5-percent pay increase .
the gdl broke ranks with the two other rail unions and rejected the deal . the union wants a separate labor contract and a pay raise of up to 31 percent .
the two sides held new talks in september to try to come to an agreement on wages , but have been unable to reach a compromise .
" if they do n't do this , then they should prepare for another battle with labor , " union boss manfred schell said .
long-distance trains barred from striking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a court ruled that freight train drivers could n't strike a labor court in the eastern german city of chemnitz ruled early friday morning that long-distance trains could not be included in the strike due to concerns that it would harm the economy .
the strike would have to be limited to local trains , the court ruled .
schell welcomed the green light the court gave to go ahead and strike on local trains , but said the drivers felt other trains should have been included in the strike as well .
" we can not comprehend why we ca n't strike on freight and long-distance lines , " he said after the court ruling .
deutsche bahn carries 5 million passengers each day and is an important engine of the german economy .
transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has warned that a drawn-out strike could have " disastrous consequences " for germany 's economic upswing . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not everyone was pleased to see him . on the second of a three-day celebration making the 80th birthday of german nobel laureate günter grass , the party in the author 's birth city of gdansk was marred by polish conservatives who threatened to strip grass of his citizenship should prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski be re-elected .
grass , who actually celebrates his birthday on oct .
16 , angered and shocked conservative poles when he admitted in august 2006 that he had been a member of the nazi waffen ss during world war ii , a secret the writer had kept for more than half a century .
the revelation sparked calls from politicians that the author be stripped of his honorary citizenship in gdansk .
grass responded in a letter to the city 's mayor in which he said that only in his old age did he find the " right formula " to talk about serving in the ss .
the mayor accepted grass ' explanation , and the author kept his honorary citizenship of the city .
however , the prospect of the citizenship being stripped has once again been raised as grass continues to rile the country 's conservatives .
polish government criticized by grass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass hopes prime minister kaczynski is not re-elected grass caused more offense earlier this year by describing the polish government as a " misfortune " and saying he hoped prime minister kaczynski would fail at the coming elections which have been called two years ahead of schedule after the collapse of the country 's conservative-led coalition .
he did little to distance himself from the controversy thursday when he called for a massive turn-out in the coming vote on october 21 in the hope that a new government would be chosen by the people .
" i am happy to be able to come here and meet my friends on the eve of my birthday , " grass said to an ecstatic crowd in gdansk .
" a huge turn out in the elections would be the most beautiful gift for me , " he added .
gdansk 's favorite son - despite nazi admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass writes about his ss career in " skinning the onion " despite his nazi admission , grass is still the city 's favorite son .
when he was born in 1927 , gdansk was known as the free city of danzig , after having been carved out of the defeated german empire following world war i. the city was awarded to poland after world war ii , when its mainly german-speaking inhabitants - including the young grass - fled or were expelled .
since beginning a new life in germany , grass has long been seen as a beacon in the process of post-world war ii polish-german reconciliation .
his best known and nobel-winning novel " the tin drum " -lrb- 1959 -rrb- is set in danzig and cologne in the 1920s through to the 1950s and is considered one of the finest examples of german post-war literature .
conservatives protest celebration , honorary citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have often stirred anti-german feeling however , not all poles are fans .
despite being invited by the gdansk municipality , which is controlled by poland 's liberal opposition , city councilors from poland 's governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party voiced their objection to the festivities in grass ' honor .
" it 's outrageous to spend so much money , " pis councilor kazimierz koralewski was quoted as saying by polish radio .

5 about the decision to remove a controversial photo exhibition which portrayed the horros of the war in chechnya . the removal of the exhibit from the european parliament was " monstrous " helga trupel , a german member of the european parliament told german news agency dpa . the ongoing fighting in chechnya can not be discussed without referring to its brutality , said trupel , who is a member of the greens .
the photos were taken down on tuesday , oct .
2 .
the photographs , some of which showed wounded chechens , mass graves and other atrocities from russia 's war in chechnya were deemed controversial and were removed .
" the pictures shown were of a really horrific nature , " an eu parliament spokesman said earlier this week .
organizers say removal was censorship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landsbergis said the removal of the exhibition amounts to censorship conservative former lithuanian president , vytautas landsbergis and right-wing polish deputy , konrad szymanski were the drivinng forces behind the photo exhibition , " chechnya : the final solution . "
the two had compiled photos that document the suffering in the war-torn breakaway republic .
their goal was to raise questions about russia 's human rights record ahead of a summit between the european union and russia scheduled for later in october .
the exhibit opened briefly before being shut down by quaestors , members of parliament in charge of overseeing internal regulations .
the quaestors had deemed the pictures too graphic and disturbing .
szymanski and landsbergis responded with outrage , calling the move " a dishonorable example of lawlessness and censorship " which " brings shame and moral injustice to this assembly " in a letter to eu parliament president , hans-gert pottering .
problems anticipated with exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of a deadly truck bomb in northern chechnya the place for politics is in the debating chamber or in parliamentary committees , a spokesman for pottering said .
problems had been anticipated with the exhibit earlier this spring , but the organizers had n't responded to concerns despite three reminders , said the quaestor who made the decision , szabolcs fazakas .
" i absolutely refute your statement that this issue is at the cost of parliament 's credibility or is a form of censorship ...
if your intention was really to organize this exhibition , why did n't you follow parliament 's rules ? " he asked .
chechnya has fought two separatist wars in a bid to gain independence .
russian president putin vowed to crush the rebels when he took office seven years ago .
russia has been accused of human rights violations during and after the two wars fought there .

5 about the decision to remove a controversial photo exhibition which portrayed the horros of the war in chechnya . the removal of the exhibit from the european parliament was " monstrous " helga trupel , a german member of the european parliament told german news agency dpa . the ongoing fighting in chechnya can not be discussed without referring to its brutality , said trupel , who is a member of the greens .

their goal was to raise questions about russia 's human rights record ahead of a summit between the european union and russia scheduled for later in october .
the exhibit opened briefly before being shut down by quaestors , members of parliament in charge of overseeing internal regulations .
the quaestors had deemed the pictures too graphic and disturbing .
szymanski and landsbergis responded with outrage , calling the move " a dishonorable example of lawlessness and censorship " which " brings shame and moral injustice to this assembly " in a letter to eu parliament president , hans-gert pottering .

not everyone was pleased to see him . on the second of a three-day celebration making the 80th birthday of german nobel laureate günter grass , the party in the author 's birth city of gdansk was marred by polish conservatives who threatened to strip grass of his citizenship should prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski be re-elected .
grass , who actually celebrates his birthday on oct .
16 , angered and shocked conservative poles when he admitted in august 2006 that he had been a member of the nazi waffen ss during world war ii , a secret the writer had kept for more than half a century .
the revelation sparked calls from politicians that the author be stripped of his honorary citizenship in gdansk .
grass responded in a letter to the city 's mayor in which he said that only in his old age did he find the " right formula " to talk about serving in the ss .
the mayor accepted grass ' explanation , and the author kept his honorary citizenship of the city .
however , the prospect of the citizenship being stripped has once again been raised as grass continues to rile the country 's conservatives .
polish government criticized by grass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass hopes prime minister kaczynski is not re-elected grass caused more offense earlier this year by describing the polish government as a " misfortune " and saying he hoped prime minister kaczynski would fail at the coming elections which have been called two years ahead of schedule after the collapse of the country 's conservative-led coalition .
he did little to distance himself from the controversy thursday when he called for a massive turn-out in the coming vote on october 21 in the hope that a new government would be chosen by the people .
" i am happy to be able to come here and meet my friends on the eve of my birthday , " grass said to an ecstatic crowd in gdansk .
" a huge turn out in the elections would be the most beautiful gift for me , " he added .
gdansk 's favorite son - despite nazi admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass writes about his ss career in " skinning the onion " despite his nazi admission , grass is still the city 's favorite son .
when he was born in 1927 , gdansk was known as the free city of danzig , after having been carved out of the defeated german empire following world war i. the city was awarded to poland after world war ii , when its mainly german-speaking inhabitants - including the young grass - fled or were expelled .
since beginning a new life in germany , grass has long been seen as a beacon in the process of post-world war ii polish-german reconciliation .
his best known and nobel-winning novel " the tin drum " -lrb- 1959 -rrb- is set in danzig and cologne in the 1920s through to the 1950s and is considered one of the finest examples of german post-war literature .
conservatives protest celebration , honorary citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have often stirred anti-german feeling however , not all poles are fans .
despite being invited by the gdansk municipality , which is controlled by poland 's liberal opposition , city councilors from poland 's governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party voiced their objection to the festivities in grass ' honor .
" it 's outrageous to spend so much money , " pis councilor kazimierz koralewski was quoted as saying by polish radio .
" grass does n't enjoy the respect of germans or of polish people any more , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those polled said they supported minimum wage requirements , better unemployment benefits and fewer taxes . the survey , conducted at the beginning of october , was commissioned by the public broadcaster ard .
a full 78 percent of german voters who were questioned said they had not profited from germany 's good economic times .
germany has been on an economic upswing for the past two years , with a predicted growth rate in 2007 of 2.5 percent .
unemployment in germany was 8.4 percent in september , the lowest it has been in the past 12 years .
yet despite the good economic times , germans seem relatively pessimistic about their personal gain .
while a majority of people across age , occupational and income groups said they had not benefited from the economic boom , the feeling was especially strong among low-income earners .
nine of 10 people with a household income under 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,116 -rrb- per month felt left out of the boom .
among families who made more than 3,000 euros per month , 48 percent thought that they had indeed done well for themselves during the economic good times .
in eastern germany people were more likely to have been unhappy with their personal gains -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- than in western germany -lrb- 77 percent -rrb- .
not seeing the benefits of the boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left out of the economic boom this survey comes on the heels of two recent reports which showed that german workers are not a happy bunch .
a report released by the bild newspaper in september showed that net salaries of german workers were at their lowest point in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros , the newspaper said , citing government figures .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
additionally , a survey in september commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation , found that one of three employees in germany believes it wo n't be possible to continue working until reaching retirement age .
only every eighth worker surveyed is happy with his job and working conditions .
respondents think the government could do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many taxes , many said respondents were asked what measures the german government could take to improve equality between the rich and poor .
some 85 percent supported improving unemployment benefits for those people who have worked and paid into the social security system .
seven out of 10 said they support a minimum wage .
germany 's ruling left-right coalition recently agreed to set a minimum wage for postal workers .
but the coalition ca n't agree on whether to institute a general minimum wage or limit it to certain industrial sectors .
respondents also felt the government could ease the tax burden , with 61 percent of respondents saying it would help improve equality .
the survey , done by infratest dimap for ard , questioned more than 1,000 eligible voters . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 . , merkel said transparency , respecting human rights and freedom of the press were all ingredients that not only helped to stabilize nations but also helped economic development .
human rights were a key issue on the first day of merkel 's visit as she visited addis ababa , the ethiopian capital .
ethiopia has been heavily criticized by human rights organizations monitoring events there since the 2005 elections , when unrest broke out over suspected vote rigging .
a number of people were killed and many more arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and zenawi amnesty international estimated the number of political prisoners at 200 .
the press in ethiopia is still largely state controlled two years after the violence .
after his discussions with merkel , zenawi pledged renewed efforts and said his government was working toward a separation of powers between the government , parliament and judiciary .
but he said ethiopia 's path towards a democracy meeting western standards was a difficult one .
merkel confident of peaceful end to border dispute for her part , merkel said that the talks with zenawi had been " constructive , " and the chancellor added that she was confident the acrimonious border dispute between ethiopia and neighboring eritrea would be peacefully settled since ethiopia had accepted the ruling of an impartial border commission .
she also pledged germany 's help in achieving stability in the region .
" it seems that the problems are mainly in the implementation -lsb- of the border commission 's recommendations -rsb- , " she said .
" wherever we can be of any assistance , germany will certainly be ready to do so . "
she did not specify how germany could help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called on europe to do more for africa at the same time , the german leader called for stronger european efforts for africa .
saying that " europe must do more , " merkel conceded that europeans had neglected africa in recent years , but europe had done some introspection , she added self-critically .
it was " in europe 's own best interest to intensify relations , " she said .
in a speech she later gave to the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , merkel reassured her audience that promises to increase development aid by 2015 would be kept .
as current president of the group of eight leading industrial nations , merkel explained that for the promises to be kept industrial nations would have to donate 0.7 percent of their economic power .
combined au and un force to protect dafur merkel said she saw africa as a whole " in motion . "
one trend , she said , had been clear for years : " fewer conflicts , more democratic elections and peaceful transitions of power .
economic growth has increased significantly , " merkel told the au .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union should join with the un to protect sudan she also spoke of a " reform partnership " with africa based on " shared values , such as the respect for universal human rights , democracy and constitutionalism " and reiterated her recent appeal for a " common spirit " between africa and the developed world to reduce poverty , ensure respect for human rights , fight disease and improve education .
the chancellor concluded by calling for the rapid deployment of a joint peacekeeping force to war-ravaged sudan .
logistical and financial hurdles must be overcome , she said , in a bid to send a joint african union-united nations force into darfur .
" the unamid mission must come to action quickly and will hopefully lead to the desired success , " she said , while emphasizing " the central responsibility for peace , stability and security lies within africa itself . "
merkel traveled on to johannesburg , south africa , on thursday evening and is to meet president thabo mbeki on friday .
she concludes her visit with a short stop-over in liberia on sunday before returning to berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

grass responded in a letter to the city 's mayor in which he said that only in his old age did he find the " right formula " to talk about serving in the ss .

4 . , merkel said transparency , respecting human rights and freedom of the press were all ingredients that not only helped to stabilize nations but also helped economic development .
human rights were a key issue on the first day of merkel 's visit as she visited addis ababa , the ethiopian capital .
ethiopia has been heavily criticized by human rights organizations monitoring events there since the 2005 elections , when unrest broke out over suspected vote rigging .
a number of people were killed and many more arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and zenawi amnesty international estimated the number of political prisoners at 200 .
the press in ethiopia is still largely state controlled two years after the violence .
after his discussions with merkel , zenawi pledged renewed efforts and said his government was working toward a separation of powers between the government , parliament and judiciary .
but he said ethiopia 's path towards a democracy meeting western standards was a difficult one .
merkel confident of peaceful end to border dispute for her part , merkel said that the talks with zenawi had been " constructive , " and the chancellor added that she was confident the acrimonious border dispute between ethiopia and neighboring eritrea would be peacefully settled since ethiopia had accepted the ruling of an impartial border commission .
she also pledged germany 's help in achieving stability in the region .
" it seems that the problems are mainly in the implementation -lsb- of the border commission 's recommendations -rsb- , " she said .
" wherever we can be of any assistance , germany will certainly be ready to do so . "
she did not specify how germany could help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called on europe to do more for africa at the same time , the german leader called for stronger european efforts for africa .
saying that " europe must do more , " merkel conceded that europeans had neglected africa in recent years , but europe had done some introspection , she added self-critically .
it was " in europe 's own best interest to intensify relations , " she said .
in a speech she later gave to the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , merkel reassured her audience that promises to increase development aid by 2015 would be kept .
as current president of the group of eight leading industrial nations , merkel explained that for the promises to be kept industrial nations would have to donate 0.7 percent of their economic power .
combined au and un force to protect dafur merkel said she saw africa as a whole " in motion . "
one trend , she said , had been clear for years : " fewer conflicts , more democratic elections and peaceful transitions of power .
economic growth has increased significantly , " merkel told the au .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union should join with the un to protect sudan she also spoke of a " reform partnership " with africa based on " shared values , such as the respect for universal human rights , democracy and constitutionalism " and reiterated her recent appeal for a " common spirit " between africa and the developed world to reduce poverty , ensure respect for human rights , fight disease and improve education .
the chancellor concluded by calling for the rapid deployment of a joint peacekeeping force to war-ravaged sudan .
logistical and financial hurdles must be overcome , she said , in a bid to send a joint african union-united nations force into darfur .
" the unamid mission must come to action quickly and will hopefully lead to the desired success , " she said , while emphasizing " the central responsibility for peace , stability and security lies within africa itself . "
merkel traveled on to johannesburg , south africa , on thursday evening and is to meet president thabo mbeki on friday .
she concludes her visit with a short stop-over in liberia on sunday before returning to berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those polled said they supported minimum wage requirements , better unemployment benefits and fewer taxes . the survey , conducted at the beginning of october , was commissioned by the public broadcaster ard .
a full 78 percent of german voters who were questioned said they had not profited from germany 's good economic times .
germany has been on an economic upswing for the past two years , with a predicted growth rate in 2007 of 2.5 percent .
unemployment in germany was 8.4 percent in september , the lowest it has been in the past 12 years .
yet despite the good economic times , germans seem relatively pessimistic about their personal gain .
while a majority of people across age , occupational and income groups said they had not benefited from the economic boom , the feeling was especially strong among low-income earners .
nine of 10 people with a household income under 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,116 -rrb- per month felt left out of the boom .
among families who made more than 3,000 euros per month , 48 percent thought that they had indeed done well for themselves during the economic good times .
in eastern germany people were more likely to have been unhappy with their personal gains -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- than in western germany -lrb- 77 percent -rrb- .
not seeing the benefits of the boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left out of the economic boom this survey comes on the heels of two recent reports which showed that german workers are not a happy bunch .
a report released by the bild newspaper in september showed that net salaries of german workers were at their lowest point in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros , the newspaper said , citing government figures .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
additionally , a survey in september commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation , found that one of three employees in germany believes it wo n't be possible to continue working until reaching retirement age .
only every eighth worker surveyed is happy with his job and working conditions .
respondents think the government could do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many taxes , many said respondents were asked what measures the german government could take to improve equality between the rich and poor .
some 85 percent supported improving unemployment benefits for those people who have worked and paid into the social security system .
seven out of 10 said they support a minimum wage .
germany 's ruling left-right coalition recently agreed to set a minimum wage for postal workers .
but the coalition ca n't agree on whether to institute a general minimum wage or limit it to certain industrial sectors .
respondents also felt the government could ease the tax burden , with 61 percent of respondents saying it would help improve equality .

4 . , merkel said transparency , respecting human rights and freedom of the press were all ingredients that not only helped to stabilize nations but also helped economic development .
human rights were a key issue on the first day of merkel 's visit as she visited addis ababa , the ethiopian capital .
ethiopia has been heavily criticized by human rights organizations monitoring events there since the 2005 elections , when unrest broke out over suspected vote rigging .
a number of people were killed and many more arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and zenawi amnesty international estimated the number of political prisoners at 200 .
the press in ethiopia is still largely state controlled two years after the violence .
after his discussions with merkel , zenawi pledged renewed efforts and said his government was working toward a separation of powers between the government , parliament and judiciary .
but he said ethiopia 's path towards a democracy meeting western standards was a difficult one .
merkel confident of peaceful end to border dispute for her part , merkel said that the talks with zenawi had been " constructive , " and the chancellor added that she was confident the acrimonious border dispute between ethiopia and neighboring eritrea would be peacefully settled since ethiopia had accepted the ruling of an impartial border commission .
she also pledged germany 's help in achieving stability in the region .
" it seems that the problems are mainly in the implementation -lsb- of the border commission 's recommendations -rsb- , " she said .
" wherever we can be of any assistance , germany will certainly be ready to do so . "

saying that " europe must do more , " merkel conceded that europeans had neglected africa in recent years , but europe had done some introspection , she added self-critically .
it was " in europe 's own best interest to intensify relations , " she said .
in a speech she later gave to the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , merkel reassured her audience that promises to increase development aid by 2015 would be kept .
as current president of the group of eight leading industrial nations , merkel explained that for the promises to be kept industrial nations would have to donate 0.7 percent of their economic power .
combined au and un force to protect dafur merkel said she saw africa as a whole " in motion . "
one trend , she said , had been clear for years : " fewer conflicts , more democratic elections and peaceful transitions of power .
economic growth has increased significantly , " merkel told the au .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union should join with the un to protect sudan she also spoke of a " reform partnership " with africa based on " shared values , such as the respect for universal human rights , democracy and constitutionalism " and reiterated her recent appeal for a " common spirit " between africa and the developed world to reduce poverty , ensure respect for human rights , fight disease and improve education .
the chancellor concluded by calling for the rapid deployment of a joint peacekeeping force to war-ravaged sudan .
logistical and financial hurdles must be overcome , she said , in a bid to send a joint african union-united nations force into darfur .
" the unamid mission must come to action quickly and will hopefully lead to the desired success , " she said , while emphasizing " the central responsibility for peace , stability and security lies within africa itself . "

4 . , merkel said transparency , respecting human rights and freedom of the press were all ingredients that not only helped to stabilize nations but also helped economic development .
human rights were a key issue on the first day of merkel 's visit as she visited addis ababa , the ethiopian capital .
ethiopia has been heavily criticized by human rights organizations monitoring events there since the 2005 elections , when unrest broke out over suspected vote rigging .
a number of people were killed and many more arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and zenawi amnesty international estimated the number of political prisoners at 200 .
the press in ethiopia is still largely state controlled two years after the violence .
after his discussions with merkel , zenawi pledged renewed efforts and said his government was working toward a separation of powers between the government , parliament and judiciary .
but he said ethiopia 's path towards a democracy meeting western standards was a difficult one .
merkel confident of peaceful end to border dispute for her part , merkel said that the talks with zenawi had been " constructive , " and the chancellor added that she was confident the acrimonious border dispute between ethiopia and neighboring eritrea would be peacefully settled since ethiopia had accepted the ruling of an impartial border commission .
she also pledged germany 's help in achieving stability in the region .
" it seems that the problems are mainly in the implementation -lsb- of the border commission 's recommendations -rsb- , " she said .
" wherever we can be of any assistance , germany will certainly be ready to do so . "
she did not specify how germany could help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called on europe to do more for africa at the same time , the german leader called for stronger european efforts for africa .
saying that " europe must do more , " merkel conceded that europeans had neglected africa in recent years , but europe had done some introspection , she added self-critically .
it was " in europe 's own best interest to intensify relations , " she said .
in a speech she later gave to the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , merkel reassured her audience that promises to increase development aid by 2015 would be kept .
as current president of the group of eight leading industrial nations , merkel explained that for the promises to be kept industrial nations would have to donate 0.7 percent of their economic power .
combined au and un force to protect dafur merkel said she saw africa as a whole " in motion . "
one trend , she said , had been clear for years : " fewer conflicts , more democratic elections and peaceful transitions of power .
economic growth has increased significantly , " merkel told the au .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union should join with the un to protect sudan she also spoke of a " reform partnership " with africa based on " shared values , such as the respect for universal human rights , democracy and constitutionalism " and reiterated her recent appeal for a " common spirit " between africa and the developed world to reduce poverty , ensure respect for human rights , fight disease and improve education .
the chancellor concluded by calling for the rapid deployment of a joint peacekeeping force to war-ravaged sudan .
logistical and financial hurdles must be overcome , she said , in a bid to send a joint african union-united nations force into darfur .
" the unamid mission must come to action quickly and will hopefully lead to the desired success , " she said , while emphasizing " the central responsibility for peace , stability and security lies within africa itself . "
merkel traveled on to johannesburg , south africa , on thursday evening and is to meet president thabo mbeki on friday .
she concludes her visit with a short stop-over in liberia on sunday before returning to berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not everyone was pleased to see him . on the second of a three-day celebration making the 80th birthday of german nobel laureate günter grass , the party in the author 's birth city of gdansk was marred by polish conservatives who threatened to strip grass of his citizenship should prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski be re-elected .
grass , who actually celebrates his birthday on oct .
16 , angered and shocked conservative poles when he admitted in august 2006 that he had been a member of the nazi waffen ss during world war ii , a secret the writer had kept for more than half a century .
the revelation sparked calls from politicians that the author be stripped of his honorary citizenship in gdansk .
grass responded in a letter to the city 's mayor in which he said that only in his old age did he find the " right formula " to talk about serving in the ss .
the mayor accepted grass ' explanation , and the author kept his honorary citizenship of the city .

he did little to distance himself from the controversy thursday when he called for a massive turn-out in the coming vote on october 21 in the hope that a new government would be chosen by the people .

since beginning a new life in germany , grass has long been seen as a beacon in the process of post-world war ii polish-german reconciliation .
his best known and nobel-winning novel " the tin drum " -lrb- 1959 -rrb- is set in danzig and cologne in the 1920s through to the 1950s and is considered one of the finest examples of german post-war literature .

a us film about a german hero who plotted to kill hitler has been highly controversial - not least because of its main star , tom cruise .
on top of it all , the production firm 's now facing the ultimate nightmare . tom cruise really tried to get it right : after all the criticism surrounding his plan to film crucial scenes of his new movie at original locations - some feared that the movie shoot would dishonor a german war memorial , others simply objected because of cruise 's scientology membership - the us actor had finally received permission to film from the german government , put on his uniform and was ready to die as colonel claus graf von stauffenberg , who had been executed by the nazis for the failed attempt on hitler 's life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film material from the finance ministry seems to have survived development " shortly before we started filming … tom cruise made brief remarks and then asked for a minute of silence - out of respect for the place and out of respect for the life achievement of these people who were executed there , " german actor christian berkel , who plays one of stauffenberg 's co-conspirators , told german tabloid bild am sonntag at the time .
unlike a previous shoot at germany 's nazi-era finance ministry - where several extras got injured after falling off a truck - things seemed to go just fine .
stauffenberg 's execution was in the can and the crew moved on to less controversial locations .

on friday , oct .

the only scene to survive the mysterious mess-up was apparently the actual execution .

berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper meanwhile reported that the rolls of film had been dipped into the wrong kind of developing agent .

on top of it all , the production firm 's now facing the ultimate nightmare . tom cruise really tried to get it right : after all the criticism surrounding his plan to film crucial scenes of his new movie at original locations - some feared that the movie shoot would dishonor a german war memorial , others simply objected because of cruise 's scientology membership - the us actor had finally received permission to film from the german government , put on his uniform and was ready to die as colonel claus graf von stauffenberg , who had been executed by the nazis for the failed attempt on hitler 's life .

those polled said they supported minimum wage requirements , better unemployment benefits and fewer taxes . the survey , conducted at the beginning of october , was commissioned by the public broadcaster ard .
a full 78 percent of german voters who were questioned said they had not profited from germany 's good economic times .
germany has been on an economic upswing for the past two years , with a predicted growth rate in 2007 of 2.5 percent .
unemployment in germany was 8.4 percent in september , the lowest it has been in the past 12 years .
yet despite the good economic times , germans seem relatively pessimistic about their personal gain .
while a majority of people across age , occupational and income groups said they had not benefited from the economic boom , the feeling was especially strong among low-income earners .
nine of 10 people with a household income under 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,116 -rrb- per month felt left out of the boom .
among families who made more than 3,000 euros per month , 48 percent thought that they had indeed done well for themselves during the economic good times .
in eastern germany people were more likely to have been unhappy with their personal gains -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- than in western germany -lrb- 77 percent -rrb- .
not seeing the benefits of the boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left out of the economic boom this survey comes on the heels of two recent reports which showed that german workers are not a happy bunch .
a report released by the bild newspaper in september showed that net salaries of german workers were at their lowest point in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros , the newspaper said , citing government figures .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
additionally , a survey in september commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation , found that one of three employees in germany believes it wo n't be possible to continue working until reaching retirement age .
only every eighth worker surveyed is happy with his job and working conditions .
respondents think the government could do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many taxes , many said respondents were asked what measures the german government could take to improve equality between the rich and poor .
some 85 percent supported improving unemployment benefits for those people who have worked and paid into the social security system .
seven out of 10 said they support a minimum wage .
germany 's ruling left-right coalition recently agreed to set a minimum wage for postal workers .
but the coalition ca n't agree on whether to institute a general minimum wage or limit it to certain industrial sectors .
respondents also felt the government could ease the tax burden , with 61 percent of respondents saying it would help improve equality .

" i 'd rather discuss the strengths and weaknesses of something and leave it up to people to decide what they believe , " said fischer , a mechanical engineer by trade . while saying that the theory of evolution explained a lot , but was unproven , he added that he was in favor of germany 's system of teaching the story of creation in religion classes and the theory of evolution in science classes . respecting religion separate from science supporters of the resolution on the other hand said that it was not meant as an attack on religious beliefs . " there are different views of the creation of the world and we respect that , " anne brasseur , a liberal parliamentarian from luxembourg , who presented the report , recently told reuters .
" the message we wanted to send was to avoid creationism passing itself off as science and being taught as science .
that 's where the danger lies . " the resolution is not binding for member states , but pace decisions carry some weight , as the body is made up of parliamentarians from the national assemblies of member states . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not everyone was pleased to see him . on the second of a three-day celebration making the 80th birthday of german nobel laureate günter grass , the party in the author 's birth city of gdansk was marred by polish conservatives who threatened to strip grass of his citizenship should prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski be re-elected .
grass , who actually celebrates his birthday on oct .
16 , angered and shocked conservative poles when he admitted in august 2006 that he had been a member of the nazi waffen ss during world war ii , a secret the writer had kept for more than half a century .
the revelation sparked calls from politicians that the author be stripped of his honorary citizenship in gdansk .
grass responded in a letter to the city 's mayor in which he said that only in his old age did he find the " right formula " to talk about serving in the ss .
the mayor accepted grass ' explanation , and the author kept his honorary citizenship of the city .
however , the prospect of the citizenship being stripped has once again been raised as grass continues to rile the country 's conservatives .
polish government criticized by grass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass hopes prime minister kaczynski is not re-elected grass caused more offense earlier this year by describing the polish government as a " misfortune " and saying he hoped prime minister kaczynski would fail at the coming elections which have been called two years ahead of schedule after the collapse of the country 's conservative-led coalition .
he did little to distance himself from the controversy thursday when he called for a massive turn-out in the coming vote on october 21 in the hope that a new government would be chosen by the people .
" i am happy to be able to come here and meet my friends on the eve of my birthday , " grass said to an ecstatic crowd in gdansk .
" a huge turn out in the elections would be the most beautiful gift for me , " he added .
gdansk 's favorite son - despite nazi admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass writes about his ss career in " skinning the onion " despite his nazi admission , grass is still the city 's favorite son .
when he was born in 1927 , gdansk was known as the free city of danzig , after having been carved out of the defeated german empire following world war i. the city was awarded to poland after world war ii , when its mainly german-speaking inhabitants - including the young grass - fled or were expelled .
since beginning a new life in germany , grass has long been seen as a beacon in the process of post-world war ii polish-german reconciliation .
his best known and nobel-winning novel " the tin drum " -lrb- 1959 -rrb- is set in danzig and cologne in the 1920s through to the 1950s and is considered one of the finest examples of german post-war literature .
conservatives protest celebration , honorary citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have often stirred anti-german feeling however , not all poles are fans .
despite being invited by the gdansk municipality , which is controlled by poland 's liberal opposition , city councilors from poland 's governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party voiced their objection to the festivities in grass ' honor .
" it 's outrageous to spend so much money , " pis councilor kazimierz koralewski was quoted as saying by polish radio .
" grass does n't enjoy the respect of germans or of polish people any more , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all think it 's the best way to deal with the issue . the resolution , entitled " the dangers of creationism in education , " was adopted in a vote on thursday , oct .
4 , during a plenary session of the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- .
while 48 members approved the document , 25 voted against it . based on a report on attempts to have creationism taught in science classes in europe , the resolution 's " aim is to warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science … the parliamentary assembly is worried about the possible ill-effect of the spread of creationist ideas within our education systems and about the consequences for our democracies .
if we are not careful , creationism could become a threat to human rights . " the document also urges member states to " defend and promote scientific knowledge " in schools and oppose attempts to place creationism on equal footing with charles darwin 's theory of evolution , the basis of modern biology . europe-wide cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first " creation museum " opened in the us in 2007 while creationism , which says that god created the world in six days , has been mainly propagated by christians in the united states , the pace report was initiated after a turkish muslim publishing group sent an islamic creationist book to schools in several countries , reuters news service reported . the pace report , however , cites cases of attempts to introduce creationism to science classes in several european countries , including belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , the netherlands , poland , russia , serbia , spain , sweden , switzerland , turkey and the united kingdom . in germany , the culture minister of the central state of hesse , karin wolff , a member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor angela merkel , recently made headlines when she suggested that the biblical concept of creation should be discussed during biology classes .
she had , however , warned that the text should not be taken literally , according to reports . conservatives complain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should students instead discuss creation in science class ?
the pace report had already been up for a vote earlier this year , but was sent back for reworking after several conservative parliamentarians had complained about it . german cdu parliamentarian axel fischer , who voted against the resolution on thursday , said that he felt that the resolution had been sloppy and included a " negative undertone against churches . " " i missed a justification for why creationism is a threat to human rights , " he told dw-world.de , adding that he thought it was wrong to ban certain things from schools from the outset . " i 'd rather discuss the strengths and weaknesses of something and leave it up to people to decide what they believe , " said fischer , a mechanical engineer by trade . while saying that the theory of evolution explained a lot , but was unproven , he added that he was in favor of germany 's system of teaching the story of creation in religion classes and the theory of evolution in science classes . respecting religion separate from science supporters of the resolution on the other hand said that it was not meant as an attack on religious beliefs . " there are different views of the creation of the world and we respect that , " anne brasseur , a liberal parliamentarian from luxembourg , who presented the report , recently told reuters .
" the message we wanted to send was to avoid creationism passing itself off as science and being taught as science .
that 's where the danger lies . " the resolution is not binding for member states , but pace decisions carry some weight , as the body is made up of parliamentarians from the national assemblies of member states . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , in a strike over wages .
despite contingency plans , delays were reported during the morning commute . train drivers went on a three-hour strike across germany starting at 8 a.m.
friday morning , complicating the morning commute .
in some german cities , such as stuttgart , two commuter train lines had been closed for lack of drivers and many regional trains had also been either delayed or cancelled .
in other cities , strike contingency plans put into place by germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn kept trains running , although less frequently .
the contingency plans aimed to keep half of the country 's 19,000 regional trains and two of every three long-distance trains operating , according to a deutsche bahn spokesman .
some drivers are not members of the union , allowing deutsche bahn to staff some of its most important commuter routes .
in germany 's industrial heartland of north rhine-westphalia , commuters seemed to have taken other modes of transportation .
commuter trains in essen , bochum and dortmund were relatively empty as the strike got underway friday morning .
drawn-out wage dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for a connection deutsche bahn has been in a months-long wage dispute with the german train drivers ' union , gdl .
the union says its members are underpaid when compared with train drivers elsewhere in europe .
in june , two larger unions representing 134,000 workers launched a series of small strikes .
deutsche bahn eventually agreed to give them an inflation-beating 4.5-percent pay increase .
the gdl broke ranks with the two other rail unions and rejected the deal . the union wants a separate labor contract and a pay raise of up to 31 percent .
the two sides held new talks in september to try to come to an agreement on wages , but have been unable to reach a compromise .
" if they do n't do this , then they should prepare for another battle with labor , " union boss manfred schell said .
long-distance trains barred from striking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a court ruled that freight train drivers could n't strike a labor court in the eastern german city of chemnitz ruled early friday morning that long-distance trains could not be included in the strike due to concerns that it would harm the economy .
the strike would have to be limited to local trains , the court ruled .
schell welcomed the green light the court gave to go ahead and strike on local trains , but said the drivers felt other trains should have been included in the strike as well .
" we can not comprehend why we ca n't strike on freight and long-distance lines , " he said after the court ruling .
deutsche bahn carries 5 million passengers each day and is an important engine of the german economy .
transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has warned that a drawn-out strike could have " disastrous consequences " for germany 's economic upswing . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a number of people were killed and many more arrested .

human rights were a key issue on the first day of merkel 's visit as she visited addis ababa , the ethiopian capital .
ethiopia has been heavily criticized by human rights organizations monitoring events there since the 2005 elections , when unrest broke out over suspected vote rigging .

not everyone was pleased to see him . on the second of a three-day celebration making the 80th birthday of german nobel laureate günter grass , the party in the author 's birth city of gdansk was marred by polish conservatives who threatened to strip grass of his citizenship should prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski be re-elected .
grass , who actually celebrates his birthday on oct .
16 , angered and shocked conservative poles when he admitted in august 2006 that he had been a member of the nazi waffen ss during world war ii , a secret the writer had kept for more than half a century .
the revelation sparked calls from politicians that the author be stripped of his honorary citizenship in gdansk .
grass responded in a letter to the city 's mayor in which he said that only in his old age did he find the " right formula " to talk about serving in the ss .
the mayor accepted grass ' explanation , and the author kept his honorary citizenship of the city .
however , the prospect of the citizenship being stripped has once again been raised as grass continues to rile the country 's conservatives .
polish government criticized by grass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass hopes prime minister kaczynski is not re-elected grass caused more offense earlier this year by describing the polish government as a " misfortune " and saying he hoped prime minister kaczynski would fail at the coming elections which have been called two years ahead of schedule after the collapse of the country 's conservative-led coalition .
he did little to distance himself from the controversy thursday when he called for a massive turn-out in the coming vote on october 21 in the hope that a new government would be chosen by the people .
" i am happy to be able to come here and meet my friends on the eve of my birthday , " grass said to an ecstatic crowd in gdansk .
" a huge turn out in the elections would be the most beautiful gift for me , " he added .
gdansk 's favorite son - despite nazi admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass writes about his ss career in " skinning the onion " despite his nazi admission , grass is still the city 's favorite son .
when he was born in 1927 , gdansk was known as the free city of danzig , after having been carved out of the defeated german empire following world war i. the city was awarded to poland after world war ii , when its mainly german-speaking inhabitants - including the young grass - fled or were expelled .
since beginning a new life in germany , grass has long been seen as a beacon in the process of post-world war ii polish-german reconciliation .
his best known and nobel-winning novel " the tin drum " -lrb- 1959 -rrb- is set in danzig and cologne in the 1920s through to the 1950s and is considered one of the finest examples of german post-war literature .
conservatives protest celebration , honorary citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have often stirred anti-german feeling however , not all poles are fans .
despite being invited by the gdansk municipality , which is controlled by poland 's liberal opposition , city councilors from poland 's governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party voiced their objection to the festivities in grass ' honor .
" it 's outrageous to spend so much money , " pis councilor kazimierz koralewski was quoted as saying by polish radio .
" grass does n't enjoy the respect of germans or of polish people any more , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those polled said they supported minimum wage requirements , better unemployment benefits and fewer taxes . the survey , conducted at the beginning of october , was commissioned by the public broadcaster ard .
a full 78 percent of german voters who were questioned said they had not profited from germany 's good economic times .
germany has been on an economic upswing for the past two years , with a predicted growth rate in 2007 of 2.5 percent .
unemployment in germany was 8.4 percent in september , the lowest it has been in the past 12 years .
yet despite the good economic times , germans seem relatively pessimistic about their personal gain .
while a majority of people across age , occupational and income groups said they had not benefited from the economic boom , the feeling was especially strong among low-income earners .
nine of 10 people with a household income under 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,116 -rrb- per month felt left out of the boom .
among families who made more than 3,000 euros per month , 48 percent thought that they had indeed done well for themselves during the economic good times .
in eastern germany people were more likely to have been unhappy with their personal gains -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- than in western germany -lrb- 77 percent -rrb- .
not seeing the benefits of the boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left out of the economic boom this survey comes on the heels of two recent reports which showed that german workers are not a happy bunch .
a report released by the bild newspaper in september showed that net salaries of german workers were at their lowest point in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros , the newspaper said , citing government figures .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
additionally , a survey in september commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation , found that one of three employees in germany believes it wo n't be possible to continue working until reaching retirement age .
only every eighth worker surveyed is happy with his job and working conditions .
respondents think the government could do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many taxes , many said respondents were asked what measures the german government could take to improve equality between the rich and poor .
some 85 percent supported improving unemployment benefits for those people who have worked and paid into the social security system .
seven out of 10 said they support a minimum wage .
germany 's ruling left-right coalition recently agreed to set a minimum wage for postal workers .
but the coalition ca n't agree on whether to institute a general minimum wage or limit it to certain industrial sectors .
respondents also felt the government could ease the tax burden , with 61 percent of respondents saying it would help improve equality .
the survey , done by infratest dimap for ard , questioned more than 1,000 eligible voters . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those polled said they supported minimum wage requirements , better unemployment benefits and fewer taxes . the survey , conducted at the beginning of october , was commissioned by the public broadcaster ard .
a full 78 percent of german voters who were questioned said they had not profited from germany 's good economic times .
germany has been on an economic upswing for the past two years , with a predicted growth rate in 2007 of 2.5 percent .
unemployment in germany was 8.4 percent in september , the lowest it has been in the past 12 years .
yet despite the good economic times , germans seem relatively pessimistic about their personal gain .
while a majority of people across age , occupational and income groups said they had not benefited from the economic boom , the feeling was especially strong among low-income earners .
nine of 10 people with a household income under 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,116 -rrb- per month felt left out of the boom .
among families who made more than 3,000 euros per month , 48 percent thought that they had indeed done well for themselves during the economic good times .
in eastern germany people were more likely to have been unhappy with their personal gains -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- than in western germany -lrb- 77 percent -rrb- .
not seeing the benefits of the boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left out of the economic boom this survey comes on the heels of two recent reports which showed that german workers are not a happy bunch .
a report released by the bild newspaper in september showed that net salaries of german workers were at their lowest point in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros , the newspaper said , citing government figures .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
additionally , a survey in september commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation , found that one of three employees in germany believes it wo n't be possible to continue working until reaching retirement age .
only every eighth worker surveyed is happy with his job and working conditions .
respondents think the government could do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many taxes , many said respondents were asked what measures the german government could take to improve equality between the rich and poor .
some 85 percent supported improving unemployment benefits for those people who have worked and paid into the social security system .
seven out of 10 said they support a minimum wage .
germany 's ruling left-right coalition recently agreed to set a minimum wage for postal workers .
but the coalition ca n't agree on whether to institute a general minimum wage or limit it to certain industrial sectors .
respondents also felt the government could ease the tax burden , with 61 percent of respondents saying it would help improve equality .

a us film about a german hero who plotted to kill hitler has been highly controversial - not least because of its main star , tom cruise .
on top of it all , the production firm 's now facing the ultimate nightmare . tom cruise really tried to get it right : after all the criticism surrounding his plan to film crucial scenes of his new movie at original locations - some feared that the movie shoot would dishonor a german war memorial , others simply objected because of cruise 's scientology membership - the us actor had finally received permission to film from the german government , put on his uniform and was ready to die as colonel claus graf von stauffenberg , who had been executed by the nazis for the failed attempt on hitler 's life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film material from the finance ministry seems to have survived development " shortly before we started filming … tom cruise made brief remarks and then asked for a minute of silence - out of respect for the place and out of respect for the life achievement of these people who were executed there , " german actor christian berkel , who plays one of stauffenberg 's co-conspirators , told german tabloid bild am sonntag at the time .
unlike a previous shoot at germany 's nazi-era finance ministry - where several extras got injured after falling off a truck - things seemed to go just fine .
stauffenberg 's execution was in the can and the crew moved on to less controversial locations .
a case of sabotage ?
it might have been smart to check the film material before dismantling the set .
on friday , oct .
5 , production officials confirmed reports that most of the celluloid had been damaged and that scenes would thus have to be re-shot as a result .
the only scene to survive the mysterious mess-up was apparently the actual execution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first round of filming at bendlerblock took place in september " it 's a material defect and that can happen , " a production spokeswoman said , according to german news service dpa .
berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper meanwhile reported that the rolls of film had been dipped into the wrong kind of developing agent .
the daily suggested the possibility of sabotage and quoted an unnamed expert who said that it was highly unlikely that several rolls of film would be " put into the wrong kind of soup . "
it 's also highly unlikely that opponents of the $ 80-million -lrb- 56.5 million euros -rrb- project would have done such a thing , as cruise and co. will now have to return to the so-called bendlerblock memorial in the german defense ministry for a second time . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de tom cruise marks disputed filming with moment of silence tom cruise finally filmed a bitterly disputed scene from his new world war ii film " valkyrie , " at the site of a memorial to the anti-nazi resistance on german defense ministry grounds .
-lrb- 24.09.2007 -rrb- report : tom cruise allowed to film in german defense ministry in a complete turnaround to an initial ban on us actor tom cruise to film at a berlin memorial to the men who tried to kill adolf hitler , german government officials have now reportedly changed their minds .

a us film about a german hero who plotted to kill hitler has been highly controversial - not least because of its main star , tom cruise .
on top of it all , the production firm 's now facing the ultimate nightmare . tom cruise really tried to get it right : after all the criticism surrounding his plan to film crucial scenes of his new movie at original locations - some feared that the movie shoot would dishonor a german war memorial , others simply objected because of cruise 's scientology membership - the us actor had finally received permission to film from the german government , put on his uniform and was ready to die as colonel claus graf von stauffenberg , who had been executed by the nazis for the failed attempt on hitler 's life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film material from the finance ministry seems to have survived development " shortly before we started filming … tom cruise made brief remarks and then asked for a minute of silence - out of respect for the place and out of respect for the life achievement of these people who were executed there , " german actor christian berkel , who plays one of stauffenberg 's co-conspirators , told german tabloid bild am sonntag at the time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 05.10.2007 polish conservatives protest as gdansk honors günter grass großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel laureate günter grass remains gdansk 's favorite son günter grass returned to his birthplace of gdansk this week to start celebrations for his forthcoming 80th birthday .
not everyone was pleased to see him . on the second of a three-day celebration making the 80th birthday of german nobel laureate günter grass , the party in the author 's birth city of gdansk was marred by polish conservatives who threatened to strip grass of his citizenship should prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski be re-elected .
grass , who actually celebrates his birthday on oct .
16 , angered and shocked conservative poles when he admitted in august 2006 that he had been a member of the nazi waffen ss during world war ii , a secret the writer had kept for more than half a century .
the revelation sparked calls from politicians that the author be stripped of his honorary citizenship in gdansk .
grass responded in a letter to the city 's mayor in which he said that only in his old age did he find the " right formula " to talk about serving in the ss .
the mayor accepted grass ' explanation , and the author kept his honorary citizenship of the city .
however , the prospect of the citizenship being stripped has once again been raised as grass continues to rile the country 's conservatives .
polish government criticized by grass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass hopes prime minister kaczynski is not re-elected grass caused more offense earlier this year by describing the polish government as a " misfortune " and saying he hoped prime minister kaczynski would fail at the coming elections which have been called two years ahead of schedule after the collapse of the country 's conservative-led coalition .
he did little to distance himself from the controversy thursday when he called for a massive turn-out in the coming vote on october 21 in the hope that a new government would be chosen by the people .
" i am happy to be able to come here and meet my friends on the eve of my birthday , " grass said to an ecstatic crowd in gdansk .
" a huge turn out in the elections would be the most beautiful gift for me , " he added .
gdansk 's favorite son - despite nazi admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass writes about his ss career in " skinning the onion " despite his nazi admission , grass is still the city 's favorite son .
when he was born in 1927 , gdansk was known as the free city of danzig , after having been carved out of the defeated german empire following world war i. the city was awarded to poland after world war ii , when its mainly german-speaking inhabitants - including the young grass - fled or were expelled .
since beginning a new life in germany , grass has long been seen as a beacon in the process of post-world war ii polish-german reconciliation .
his best known and nobel-winning novel " the tin drum " -lrb- 1959 -rrb- is set in danzig and cologne in the 1920s through to the 1950s and is considered one of the finest examples of german post-war literature .
conservatives protest celebration , honorary citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have often stirred anti-german feeling however , not all poles are fans .
despite being invited by the gdansk municipality , which is controlled by poland 's liberal opposition , city councilors from poland 's governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party voiced their objection to the festivities in grass ' honor .
" it 's outrageous to spend so much money , " pis councilor kazimierz koralewski was quoted as saying by polish radio .
" grass does n't enjoy the respect of germans or of polish people any more , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" his great message us that we need peace on earth to resolve the world 's conflicts .
the many conflicts in africa that we have at the moment show that his way is the right way and we should take it to heart , " she said .

" there was a common determination to conclude them -lrb- the talks -rrb- as quickly as possible , " mbeki told reporters .
" we are confident they will reach an agreement on all of these matters so , at least as far as the political challenges are concerned , there was a united voice , " mbeki added .
" very good progress is in fact being made at the negotiations . "
mbeki confident that zimbabwe elections will be fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflation is out of control and crippling zimbabwe " both the ruling party and opposition are committed to making sure the elections are free and fair , " he added .
" next year after the elections it will be very important they take the same approach with regard to economic challenges that they together evolve a common approach . "
the talks between mugabe 's zanu-pf party and the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- have focused on constitutional changes , changes to some laws , the reconstitution of the electoral commission and the creation of conditions conducive to free and fair presidential and parliamentary elections in zimbabwe in march 2008 , mbeki said .
while zimbabwe dominated the talks between merkel and mbeki , there was time for a lighter topic , that of the 2010 world cup .
merkel pledges german support to 2010 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after initial concerns , south africa is building its world cup after presiding over the remarkably successful 2006 tournament , merkel offered germany 's assistance in making the south african event just as memorable .
" this will open up an opportunity to project a new image for your country and indeed for the continent as a whole , " she said .
" wherever we can , we would like to help you , we would like to give our contribution .
we already cooperate to a certain extent on the construction of stadiums and exchange of experience on how best to cooperate with fifa , " added merkel who later toured the site where the host stadium for the 2010 final is under construction .
mbeki thanked his german counterpart and praised germany 's hosting of last year 's event .
" we are very fortunate to be holding the fifa world cup after germany .

" the pictures shown were of a really horrific nature , " an eu parliament spokesman said earlier this week .
organizers say removal was censorship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landsbergis said the removal of the exhibition amounts to censorship conservative former lithuanian president , vytautas landsbergis and right-wing polish deputy , konrad szymanski were the drivinng forces behind the photo exhibition , " chechnya : the final solution . "
the two had compiled photos that document the suffering in the war-torn breakaway republic .
their goal was to raise questions about russia 's human rights record ahead of a summit between the european union and russia scheduled for later in october .
the exhibit opened briefly before being shut down by quaestors , members of parliament in charge of overseeing internal regulations .
the quaestors had deemed the pictures too graphic and disturbing .
szymanski and landsbergis responded with outrage , calling the move " a dishonorable example of lawlessness and censorship " which " brings shame and moral injustice to this assembly " in a letter to eu parliament president , hans-gert pottering .
problems anticipated with exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of a deadly truck bomb in northern chechnya the place for politics is in the debating chamber or in parliamentary committees , a spokesman for pottering said .
problems had been anticipated with the exhibit earlier this spring , but the organizers had n't responded to concerns despite three reminders , said the quaestor who made the decision , szabolcs fazakas .
" i absolutely refute your statement that this issue is at the cost of parliament 's credibility or is a form of censorship ...
if your intention was really to organize this exhibition , why did n't you follow parliament 's rules ? " he asked .
chechnya has fought two separatist wars in a bid to gain independence .
russian president putin vowed to crush the rebels when he took office seven years ago .
russia has been accused of human rights violations during and after the two wars fought there .
human rights groups want the eu to raise the issue with russia at a summit on oct .

the revelation sparked calls from politicians that the author be stripped of his honorary citizenship in gdansk .
grass responded in a letter to the city 's mayor in which he said that only in his old age did he find the " right formula " to talk about serving in the ss .

not everyone was pleased to see him . on the second of a three-day celebration making the 80th birthday of german nobel laureate günter grass , the party in the author 's birth city of gdansk was marred by polish conservatives who threatened to strip grass of his citizenship should prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski be re-elected .
grass , who actually celebrates his birthday on oct .
16 , angered and shocked conservative poles when he admitted in august 2006 that he had been a member of the nazi waffen ss during world war ii , a secret the writer had kept for more than half a century .
the revelation sparked calls from politicians that the author be stripped of his honorary citizenship in gdansk .
grass responded in a letter to the city 's mayor in which he said that only in his old age did he find the " right formula " to talk about serving in the ss .
the mayor accepted grass ' explanation , and the author kept his honorary citizenship of the city .
however , the prospect of the citizenship being stripped has once again been raised as grass continues to rile the country 's conservatives .
polish government criticized by grass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass hopes prime minister kaczynski is not re-elected grass caused more offense earlier this year by describing the polish government as a " misfortune " and saying he hoped prime minister kaczynski would fail at the coming elections which have been called two years ahead of schedule after the collapse of the country 's conservative-led coalition .
he did little to distance himself from the controversy thursday when he called for a massive turn-out in the coming vote on october 21 in the hope that a new government would be chosen by the people .
" i am happy to be able to come here and meet my friends on the eve of my birthday , " grass said to an ecstatic crowd in gdansk .
" a huge turn out in the elections would be the most beautiful gift for me , " he added .
gdansk 's favorite son - despite nazi admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass writes about his ss career in " skinning the onion " despite his nazi admission , grass is still the city 's favorite son .
when he was born in 1927 , gdansk was known as the free city of danzig , after having been carved out of the defeated german empire following world war i. the city was awarded to poland after world war ii , when its mainly german-speaking inhabitants - including the young grass - fled or were expelled .
since beginning a new life in germany , grass has long been seen as a beacon in the process of post-world war ii polish-german reconciliation .
his best known and nobel-winning novel " the tin drum " -lrb- 1959 -rrb- is set in danzig and cologne in the 1920s through to the 1950s and is considered one of the finest examples of german post-war literature .
conservatives protest celebration , honorary citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have often stirred anti-german feeling however , not all poles are fans .
despite being invited by the gdansk municipality , which is controlled by poland 's liberal opposition , city councilors from poland 's governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party voiced their objection to the festivities in grass ' honor .
" it 's outrageous to spend so much money , " pis councilor kazimierz koralewski was quoted as saying by polish radio .
" grass does n't enjoy the respect of germans or of polish people any more , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a us film about a german hero who plotted to kill hitler has been highly controversial - not least because of its main star , tom cruise .
on top of it all , the production firm 's now facing the ultimate nightmare . tom cruise really tried to get it right : after all the criticism surrounding his plan to film crucial scenes of his new movie at original locations - some feared that the movie shoot would dishonor a german war memorial , others simply objected because of cruise 's scientology membership - the us actor had finally received permission to film from the german government , put on his uniform and was ready to die as colonel claus graf von stauffenberg , who had been executed by the nazis for the failed attempt on hitler 's life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film material from the finance ministry seems to have survived development " shortly before we started filming … tom cruise made brief remarks and then asked for a minute of silence - out of respect for the place and out of respect for the life achievement of these people who were executed there , " german actor christian berkel , who plays one of stauffenberg 's co-conspirators , told german tabloid bild am sonntag at the time .
unlike a previous shoot at germany 's nazi-era finance ministry - where several extras got injured after falling off a truck - things seemed to go just fine .
stauffenberg 's execution was in the can and the crew moved on to less controversial locations .
a case of sabotage ?
it might have been smart to check the film material before dismantling the set .
on friday , oct .
5 , production officials confirmed reports that most of the celluloid had been damaged and that scenes would thus have to be re-shot as a result .
the only scene to survive the mysterious mess-up was apparently the actual execution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first round of filming at bendlerblock took place in september " it 's a material defect and that can happen , " a production spokeswoman said , according to german news service dpa .
berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper meanwhile reported that the rolls of film had been dipped into the wrong kind of developing agent .
the daily suggested the possibility of sabotage and quoted an unnamed expert who said that it was highly unlikely that several rolls of film would be " put into the wrong kind of soup . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film material from the finance ministry seems to have survived development " shortly before we started filming … tom cruise made brief remarks and then asked for a minute of silence - out of respect for the place and out of respect for the life achievement of these people who were executed there , " german actor christian berkel , who plays one of stauffenberg 's co-conspirators , told german tabloid bild am sonntag at the time .
unlike a previous shoot at germany 's nazi-era finance ministry - where several extras got injured after falling off a truck - things seemed to go just fine .
stauffenberg 's execution was in the can and the crew moved on to less controversial locations .
a case of sabotage ?
it might have been smart to check the film material before dismantling the set .
on friday , oct .
5 , production officials confirmed reports that most of the celluloid had been damaged and that scenes would thus have to be re-shot as a result .
the only scene to survive the mysterious mess-up was apparently the actual execution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first round of filming at bendlerblock took place in september " it 's a material defect and that can happen , " a production spokeswoman said , according to german news service dpa .
berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper meanwhile reported that the rolls of film had been dipped into the wrong kind of developing agent .

those polled said they supported minimum wage requirements , better unemployment benefits and fewer taxes . the survey , conducted at the beginning of october , was commissioned by the public broadcaster ard .
a full 78 percent of german voters who were questioned said they had not profited from germany 's good economic times .
germany has been on an economic upswing for the past two years , with a predicted growth rate in 2007 of 2.5 percent .
unemployment in germany was 8.4 percent in september , the lowest it has been in the past 12 years .
yet despite the good economic times , germans seem relatively pessimistic about their personal gain .
while a majority of people across age , occupational and income groups said they had not benefited from the economic boom , the feeling was especially strong among low-income earners .
nine of 10 people with a household income under 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,116 -rrb- per month felt left out of the boom .
among families who made more than 3,000 euros per month , 48 percent thought that they had indeed done well for themselves during the economic good times .
in eastern germany people were more likely to have been unhappy with their personal gains -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- than in western germany -lrb- 77 percent -rrb- .
not seeing the benefits of the boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left out of the economic boom this survey comes on the heels of two recent reports which showed that german workers are not a happy bunch .
a report released by the bild newspaper in september showed that net salaries of german workers were at their lowest point in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros , the newspaper said , citing government figures .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
additionally , a survey in september commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation , found that one of three employees in germany believes it wo n't be possible to continue working until reaching retirement age .
only every eighth worker surveyed is happy with his job and working conditions .
respondents think the government could do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many taxes , many said respondents were asked what measures the german government could take to improve equality between the rich and poor .
some 85 percent supported improving unemployment benefits for those people who have worked and paid into the social security system .
seven out of 10 said they support a minimum wage .
germany 's ruling left-right coalition recently agreed to set a minimum wage for postal workers .
but the coalition ca n't agree on whether to institute a general minimum wage or limit it to certain industrial sectors .
respondents also felt the government could ease the tax burden , with 61 percent of respondents saying it would help improve equality .

those polled said they supported minimum wage requirements , better unemployment benefits and fewer taxes . the survey , conducted at the beginning of october , was commissioned by the public broadcaster ard .
a full 78 percent of german voters who were questioned said they had not profited from germany 's good economic times .
germany has been on an economic upswing for the past two years , with a predicted growth rate in 2007 of 2.5 percent .
unemployment in germany was 8.4 percent in september , the lowest it has been in the past 12 years .
yet despite the good economic times , germans seem relatively pessimistic about their personal gain .
while a majority of people across age , occupational and income groups said they had not benefited from the economic boom , the feeling was especially strong among low-income earners .
nine of 10 people with a household income under 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,116 -rrb- per month felt left out of the boom .
among families who made more than 3,000 euros per month , 48 percent thought that they had indeed done well for themselves during the economic good times .
in eastern germany people were more likely to have been unhappy with their personal gains -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- than in western germany -lrb- 77 percent -rrb- .
not seeing the benefits of the boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left out of the economic boom this survey comes on the heels of two recent reports which showed that german workers are not a happy bunch .
a report released by the bild newspaper in september showed that net salaries of german workers were at their lowest point in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros , the newspaper said , citing government figures .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
additionally , a survey in september commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation , found that one of three employees in germany believes it wo n't be possible to continue working until reaching retirement age .
only every eighth worker surveyed is happy with his job and working conditions .
respondents think the government could do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many taxes , many said respondents were asked what measures the german government could take to improve equality between the rich and poor .

" i 'd rather discuss the strengths and weaknesses of something and leave it up to people to decide what they believe , " said fischer , a mechanical engineer by trade . while saying that the theory of evolution explained a lot , but was unproven , he added that he was in favor of germany 's system of teaching the story of creation in religion classes and the theory of evolution in science classes . respecting religion separate from science supporters of the resolution on the other hand said that it was not meant as an attack on religious beliefs .

in other cities , strike contingency plans put into place by germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn kept trains running , although less frequently .
the contingency plans aimed to keep half of the country 's 19,000 regional trains and two of every three long-distance trains operating , according to a deutsche bahn spokesman .

the contingency plans aimed to keep half of the country 's 19,000 regional trains and two of every three long-distance trains operating , according to a deutsche bahn spokesman .

the gdl broke ranks with the two other rail unions and rejected the deal . the union wants a separate labor contract and a pay raise of up to 31 percent .
the two sides held new talks in september to try to come to an agreement on wages , but have been unable to reach a compromise .

schell welcomed the green light the court gave to go ahead and strike on local trains , but said the drivers felt other trains should have been included in the strike as well .
" we can not comprehend why we ca n't strike on freight and long-distance lines , " he said after the court ruling .

4 . , merkel said transparency , respecting human rights and freedom of the press were all ingredients that not only helped to stabilize nations but also helped economic development .
human rights were a key issue on the first day of merkel 's visit as she visited addis ababa , the ethiopian capital .
ethiopia has been heavily criticized by human rights organizations monitoring events there since the 2005 elections , when unrest broke out over suspected vote rigging .
a number of people were killed and many more arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and zenawi amnesty international estimated the number of political prisoners at 200 .
the press in ethiopia is still largely state controlled two years after the violence .
after his discussions with merkel , zenawi pledged renewed efforts and said his government was working toward a separation of powers between the government , parliament and judiciary .
but he said ethiopia 's path towards a democracy meeting western standards was a difficult one .
merkel confident of peaceful end to border dispute for her part , merkel said that the talks with zenawi had been " constructive , " and the chancellor added that she was confident the acrimonious border dispute between ethiopia and neighboring eritrea would be peacefully settled since ethiopia had accepted the ruling of an impartial border commission .
she also pledged germany 's help in achieving stability in the region .
" it seems that the problems are mainly in the implementation -lsb- of the border commission 's recommendations -rsb- , " she said .
" wherever we can be of any assistance , germany will certainly be ready to do so . "
she did not specify how germany could help .

saying that " europe must do more , " merkel conceded that europeans had neglected africa in recent years , but europe had done some introspection , she added self-critically .
it was " in europe 's own best interest to intensify relations , " she said .
in a speech she later gave to the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , merkel reassured her audience that promises to increase development aid by 2015 would be kept .
as current president of the group of eight leading industrial nations , merkel explained that for the promises to be kept industrial nations would have to donate 0.7 percent of their economic power .
combined au and un force to protect dafur merkel said she saw africa as a whole " in motion . "
one trend , she said , had been clear for years : " fewer conflicts , more democratic elections and peaceful transitions of power .
economic growth has increased significantly , " merkel told the au .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union should join with the un to protect sudan she also spoke of a " reform partnership " with africa based on " shared values , such as the respect for universal human rights , democracy and constitutionalism " and reiterated her recent appeal for a " common spirit " between africa and the developed world to reduce poverty , ensure respect for human rights , fight disease and improve education .
the chancellor concluded by calling for the rapid deployment of a joint peacekeeping force to war-ravaged sudan .
logistical and financial hurdles must be overcome , she said , in a bid to send a joint african union-united nations force into darfur .
" the unamid mission must come to action quickly and will hopefully lead to the desired success , " she said , while emphasizing " the central responsibility for peace , stability and security lies within africa itself . "

4 . , merkel said transparency , respecting human rights and freedom of the press were all ingredients that not only helped to stabilize nations but also helped economic development .
human rights were a key issue on the first day of merkel 's visit as she visited addis ababa , the ethiopian capital .
ethiopia has been heavily criticized by human rights organizations monitoring events there since the 2005 elections , when unrest broke out over suspected vote rigging .
a number of people were killed and many more arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and zenawi amnesty international estimated the number of political prisoners at 200 .
the press in ethiopia is still largely state controlled two years after the violence .
after his discussions with merkel , zenawi pledged renewed efforts and said his government was working toward a separation of powers between the government , parliament and judiciary .
but he said ethiopia 's path towards a democracy meeting western standards was a difficult one .
merkel confident of peaceful end to border dispute for her part , merkel said that the talks with zenawi had been " constructive , " and the chancellor added that she was confident the acrimonious border dispute between ethiopia and neighboring eritrea would be peacefully settled since ethiopia had accepted the ruling of an impartial border commission .
she also pledged germany 's help in achieving stability in the region .
" it seems that the problems are mainly in the implementation -lsb- of the border commission 's recommendations -rsb- , " she said .
" wherever we can be of any assistance , germany will certainly be ready to do so . "
she did not specify how germany could help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called on europe to do more for africa at the same time , the german leader called for stronger european efforts for africa .
saying that " europe must do more , " merkel conceded that europeans had neglected africa in recent years , but europe had done some introspection , she added self-critically .
it was " in europe 's own best interest to intensify relations , " she said .
in a speech she later gave to the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , merkel reassured her audience that promises to increase development aid by 2015 would be kept .
as current president of the group of eight leading industrial nations , merkel explained that for the promises to be kept industrial nations would have to donate 0.7 percent of their economic power .
combined au and un force to protect dafur merkel said she saw africa as a whole " in motion . "
one trend , she said , had been clear for years : " fewer conflicts , more democratic elections and peaceful transitions of power .
economic growth has increased significantly , " merkel told the au .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union should join with the un to protect sudan she also spoke of a " reform partnership " with africa based on " shared values , such as the respect for universal human rights , democracy and constitutionalism " and reiterated her recent appeal for a " common spirit " between africa and the developed world to reduce poverty , ensure respect for human rights , fight disease and improve education .
the chancellor concluded by calling for the rapid deployment of a joint peacekeeping force to war-ravaged sudan .
logistical and financial hurdles must be overcome , she said , in a bid to send a joint african union-united nations force into darfur .
" the unamid mission must come to action quickly and will hopefully lead to the desired success , " she said , while emphasizing " the central responsibility for peace , stability and security lies within africa itself . "
merkel traveled on to johannesburg , south africa , on thursday evening and is to meet president thabo mbeki on friday .

the photographs , some of which showed wounded chechens , mass graves and other atrocities from russia 's war in chechnya were deemed controversial and were removed .
" the pictures shown were of a really horrific nature , " an eu parliament spokesman said earlier this week .
organizers say removal was censorship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landsbergis said the removal of the exhibition amounts to censorship conservative former lithuanian president , vytautas landsbergis and right-wing polish deputy , konrad szymanski were the drivinng forces behind the photo exhibition , " chechnya : the final solution .

the two had compiled photos that document the suffering in the war-torn breakaway republic .
their goal was to raise questions about russia 's human rights record ahead of a summit between the european union and russia scheduled for later in october .
the exhibit opened briefly before being shut down by quaestors , members of parliament in charge of overseeing internal regulations .
the quaestors had deemed the pictures too graphic and disturbing .
szymanski and landsbergis responded with outrage , calling the move " a dishonorable example of lawlessness and censorship " which " brings shame and moral injustice to this assembly " in a letter to eu parliament president , hans-gert pottering .

5 , in a strike over wages .
despite contingency plans , delays were reported during the morning commute . train drivers went on a three-hour strike across germany starting at 8 a.m.
friday morning , complicating the morning commute .
in some german cities , such as stuttgart , two commuter train lines had been closed for lack of drivers and many regional trains had also been either delayed or cancelled .
in other cities , strike contingency plans put into place by germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn kept trains running , although less frequently .
the contingency plans aimed to keep half of the country 's 19,000 regional trains and two of every three long-distance trains operating , according to a deutsche bahn spokesman .
some drivers are not members of the union , allowing deutsche bahn to staff some of its most important commuter routes .
in germany 's industrial heartland of north rhine-westphalia , commuters seemed to have taken other modes of transportation .
commuter trains in essen , bochum and dortmund were relatively empty as the strike got underway friday morning .
drawn-out wage dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for a connection deutsche bahn has been in a months-long wage dispute with the german train drivers ' union , gdl .
the union says its members are underpaid when compared with train drivers elsewhere in europe .
in june , two larger unions representing 134,000 workers launched a series of small strikes .
deutsche bahn eventually agreed to give them an inflation-beating 4.5-percent pay increase .
the gdl broke ranks with the two other rail unions and rejected the deal . the union wants a separate labor contract and a pay raise of up to 31 percent .
the two sides held new talks in september to try to come to an agreement on wages , but have been unable to reach a compromise .
" if they do n't do this , then they should prepare for another battle with labor , " union boss manfred schell said .
long-distance trains barred from striking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a court ruled that freight train drivers could n't strike a labor court in the eastern german city of chemnitz ruled early friday morning that long-distance trains could not be included in the strike due to concerns that it would harm the economy .
the strike would have to be limited to local trains , the court ruled .
schell welcomed the green light the court gave to go ahead and strike on local trains , but said the drivers felt other trains should have been included in the strike as well .
" we can not comprehend why we ca n't strike on freight and long-distance lines , " he said after the court ruling .
deutsche bahn carries 5 million passengers each day and is an important engine of the german economy .
transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has warned that a drawn-out strike could have " disastrous consequences " for germany 's economic upswing . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 about the decision to remove a controversial photo exhibition which portrayed the horros of the war in chechnya . the removal of the exhibit from the european parliament was " monstrous " helga trupel , a german member of the european parliament told german news agency dpa . the ongoing fighting in chechnya can not be discussed without referring to its brutality , said trupel , who is a member of the greens .
the photos were taken down on tuesday , oct .
2 .
the photographs , some of which showed wounded chechens , mass graves and other atrocities from russia 's war in chechnya were deemed controversial and were removed .
" the pictures shown were of a really horrific nature , " an eu parliament spokesman said earlier this week .
organizers say removal was censorship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landsbergis said the removal of the exhibition amounts to censorship conservative former lithuanian president , vytautas landsbergis and right-wing polish deputy , konrad szymanski were the drivinng forces behind the photo exhibition , " chechnya : the final solution . "
the two had compiled photos that document the suffering in the war-torn breakaway republic .
their goal was to raise questions about russia 's human rights record ahead of a summit between the european union and russia scheduled for later in october .
the exhibit opened briefly before being shut down by quaestors , members of parliament in charge of overseeing internal regulations .
the quaestors had deemed the pictures too graphic and disturbing .
szymanski and landsbergis responded with outrage , calling the move " a dishonorable example of lawlessness and censorship " which " brings shame and moral injustice to this assembly " in a letter to eu parliament president , hans-gert pottering .
problems anticipated with exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of a deadly truck bomb in northern chechnya the place for politics is in the debating chamber or in parliamentary committees , a spokesman for pottering said .
problems had been anticipated with the exhibit earlier this spring , but the organizers had n't responded to concerns despite three reminders , said the quaestor who made the decision , szabolcs fazakas .
" i absolutely refute your statement that this issue is at the cost of parliament 's credibility or is a form of censorship ...
if your intention was really to organize this exhibition , why did n't you follow parliament 's rules ? " he asked .
chechnya has fought two separatist wars in a bid to gain independence .
russian president putin vowed to crush the rebels when he took office seven years ago .
russia has been accused of human rights violations during and after the two wars fought there .

human rights were a key issue on the first day of merkel 's visit as she visited addis ababa , the ethiopian capital .
ethiopia has been heavily criticized by human rights organizations monitoring events there since the 2005 elections , when unrest broke out over suspected vote rigging .
a number of people were killed and many more arrested .

but he said ethiopia 's path towards a democracy meeting western standards was a difficult one .
merkel confident of peaceful end to border dispute for her part , merkel said that the talks with zenawi had been " constructive , " and the chancellor added that she was confident the acrimonious border dispute between ethiopia and neighboring eritrea would be peacefully settled since ethiopia had accepted the ruling of an impartial border commission .
she also pledged germany 's help in achieving stability in the region .

4 . , merkel said transparency , respecting human rights and freedom of the press were all ingredients that not only helped to stabilize nations but also helped economic development .
human rights were a key issue on the first day of merkel 's visit as she visited addis ababa , the ethiopian capital .
ethiopia has been heavily criticized by human rights organizations monitoring events there since the 2005 elections , when unrest broke out over suspected vote rigging .
a number of people were killed and many more arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and zenawi amnesty international estimated the number of political prisoners at 200 .
the press in ethiopia is still largely state controlled two years after the violence .
after his discussions with merkel , zenawi pledged renewed efforts and said his government was working toward a separation of powers between the government , parliament and judiciary .
but he said ethiopia 's path towards a democracy meeting western standards was a difficult one .
merkel confident of peaceful end to border dispute for her part , merkel said that the talks with zenawi had been " constructive , " and the chancellor added that she was confident the acrimonious border dispute between ethiopia and neighboring eritrea would be peacefully settled since ethiopia had accepted the ruling of an impartial border commission .
she also pledged germany 's help in achieving stability in the region .
" it seems that the problems are mainly in the implementation -lsb- of the border commission 's recommendations -rsb- , " she said .
" wherever we can be of any assistance , germany will certainly be ready to do so . "
she did not specify how germany could help .

saying that " europe must do more , " merkel conceded that europeans had neglected africa in recent years , but europe had done some introspection , she added self-critically .
it was " in europe 's own best interest to intensify relations , " she said .
in a speech she later gave to the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , merkel reassured her audience that promises to increase development aid by 2015 would be kept .
as current president of the group of eight leading industrial nations , merkel explained that for the promises to be kept industrial nations would have to donate 0.7 percent of their economic power .
combined au and un force to protect dafur merkel said she saw africa as a whole " in motion . "
one trend , she said , had been clear for years : " fewer conflicts , more democratic elections and peaceful transitions of power .
economic growth has increased significantly , " merkel told the au .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union should join with the un to protect sudan she also spoke of a " reform partnership " with africa based on " shared values , such as the respect for universal human rights , democracy and constitutionalism " and reiterated her recent appeal for a " common spirit " between africa and the developed world to reduce poverty , ensure respect for human rights , fight disease and improve education .
the chancellor concluded by calling for the rapid deployment of a joint peacekeeping force to war-ravaged sudan .
logistical and financial hurdles must be overcome , she said , in a bid to send a joint african union-united nations force into darfur .
" the unamid mission must come to action quickly and will hopefully lead to the desired success , " she said , while emphasizing " the central responsibility for peace , stability and security lies within africa itself . "

5 about the decision to remove a controversial photo exhibition which portrayed the horros of the war in chechnya . the removal of the exhibit from the european parliament was " monstrous " helga trupel , a german member of the european parliament told german news agency dpa . the ongoing fighting in chechnya can not be discussed without referring to its brutality , said trupel , who is a member of the greens .
the photos were taken down on tuesday , oct .
2 .
the photographs , some of which showed wounded chechens , mass graves and other atrocities from russia 's war in chechnya were deemed controversial and were removed .
" the pictures shown were of a really horrific nature , " an eu parliament spokesman said earlier this week .
organizers say removal was censorship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landsbergis said the removal of the exhibition amounts to censorship conservative former lithuanian president , vytautas landsbergis and right-wing polish deputy , konrad szymanski were the drivinng forces behind the photo exhibition , " chechnya : the final solution . "
the two had compiled photos that document the suffering in the war-torn breakaway republic .
their goal was to raise questions about russia 's human rights record ahead of a summit between the european union and russia scheduled for later in october .
the exhibit opened briefly before being shut down by quaestors , members of parliament in charge of overseeing internal regulations .
the quaestors had deemed the pictures too graphic and disturbing .
szymanski and landsbergis responded with outrage , calling the move " a dishonorable example of lawlessness and censorship " which " brings shame and moral injustice to this assembly " in a letter to eu parliament president , hans-gert pottering .
problems anticipated with exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of a deadly truck bomb in northern chechnya the place for politics is in the debating chamber or in parliamentary committees , a spokesman for pottering said .
problems had been anticipated with the exhibit earlier this spring , but the organizers had n't responded to concerns despite three reminders , said the quaestor who made the decision , szabolcs fazakas .
" i absolutely refute your statement that this issue is at the cost of parliament 's credibility or is a form of censorship ...
if your intention was really to organize this exhibition , why did n't you follow parliament 's rules ? " he asked .
chechnya has fought two separatist wars in a bid to gain independence .
russian president putin vowed to crush the rebels when he took office seven years ago .
russia has been accused of human rights violations during and after the two wars fought there .
human rights groups want the eu to raise the issue with russia at a summit on oct .

the soldiers have already been discharged from hospital , the german military said in afghanistan .
but it remained unclear whether the incident was a targeted attack as it could also have been an anti-tank mine , sources added .
the attack follows a similar one in july in which three senior german police officers were killed when their vehicles were hit by a roadside bomb on the eastern outskirts of kabul .
in may , three bundeswehr soldiers were killed and two others wounded when a bomb went off in a crowded bazaar in kabul .
twenty-four german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 .

" several coalition force members were wounded as a result of heavy fighting , " a coalition statement said .

not all think it 's the best way to deal with the issue . the resolution , entitled " the dangers of creationism in education , " was adopted in a vote on thursday , oct .
4 , during a plenary session of the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- .
while 48 members approved the document , 25 voted against it . based on a report on attempts to have creationism taught in science classes in europe , the resolution 's " aim is to warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science … the parliamentary assembly is worried about the possible ill-effect of the spread of creationist ideas within our education systems and about the consequences for our democracies .
if we are not careful , creationism could become a threat to human rights . " the document also urges member states to " defend and promote scientific knowledge " in schools and oppose attempts to place creationism on equal footing with charles darwin 's theory of evolution , the basis of modern biology . europe-wide cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first " creation museum " opened in the us in 2007 while creationism , which says that god created the world in six days , has been mainly propagated by christians in the united states , the pace report was initiated after a turkish muslim publishing group sent an islamic creationist book to schools in several countries , reuters news service reported . the pace report , however , cites cases of attempts to introduce creationism to science classes in several european countries , including belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , the netherlands , poland , russia , serbia , spain , sweden , switzerland , turkey and the united kingdom . in germany , the culture minister of the central state of hesse , karin wolff , a member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor angela merkel , recently made headlines when she suggested that the biblical concept of creation should be discussed during biology classes .
she had , however , warned that the text should not be taken literally , according to reports . conservatives complain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should students instead discuss creation in science class ?
the pace report had already been up for a vote earlier this year , but was sent back for reworking after several conservative parliamentarians had complained about it . german cdu parliamentarian axel fischer , who voted against the resolution on thursday , said that he felt that the resolution had been sloppy and included a " negative undertone against churches . " " i missed a justification for why creationism is a threat to human rights , " he told dw-world.de , adding that he thought it was wrong to ban certain things from schools from the outset . " i 'd rather discuss the strengths and weaknesses of something and leave it up to people to decide what they believe , " said fischer , a mechanical engineer by trade . while saying that the theory of evolution explained a lot , but was unproven , he added that he was in favor of germany 's system of teaching the story of creation in religion classes and the theory of evolution in science classes . respecting religion separate from science supporters of the resolution on the other hand said that it was not meant as an attack on religious beliefs . " there are different views of the creation of the world and we respect that , " anne brasseur , a liberal parliamentarian from luxembourg , who presented the report , recently told reuters .
" the message we wanted to send was to avoid creationism passing itself off as science and being taught as science .
that 's where the danger lies .

those polled said they supported minimum wage requirements , better unemployment benefits and fewer taxes . the survey , conducted at the beginning of october , was commissioned by the public broadcaster ard .
a full 78 percent of german voters who were questioned said they had not profited from germany 's good economic times .
germany has been on an economic upswing for the past two years , with a predicted growth rate in 2007 of 2.5 percent .
unemployment in germany was 8.4 percent in september , the lowest it has been in the past 12 years .
yet despite the good economic times , germans seem relatively pessimistic about their personal gain .
while a majority of people across age , occupational and income groups said they had not benefited from the economic boom , the feeling was especially strong among low-income earners .
nine of 10 people with a household income under 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,116 -rrb- per month felt left out of the boom .
among families who made more than 3,000 euros per month , 48 percent thought that they had indeed done well for themselves during the economic good times .
in eastern germany people were more likely to have been unhappy with their personal gains -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- than in western germany -lrb- 77 percent -rrb- .
not seeing the benefits of the boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left out of the economic boom this survey comes on the heels of two recent reports which showed that german workers are not a happy bunch .
a report released by the bild newspaper in september showed that net salaries of german workers were at their lowest point in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros , the newspaper said , citing government figures .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
additionally , a survey in september commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation , found that one of three employees in germany believes it wo n't be possible to continue working until reaching retirement age .
only every eighth worker surveyed is happy with his job and working conditions .
respondents think the government could do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many taxes , many said respondents were asked what measures the german government could take to improve equality between the rich and poor .
some 85 percent supported improving unemployment benefits for those people who have worked and paid into the social security system .
seven out of 10 said they support a minimum wage .
germany 's ruling left-right coalition recently agreed to set a minimum wage for postal workers .
but the coalition ca n't agree on whether to institute a general minimum wage or limit it to certain industrial sectors .

those polled said they supported minimum wage requirements , better unemployment benefits and fewer taxes . the survey , conducted at the beginning of october , was commissioned by the public broadcaster ard .
a full 78 percent of german voters who were questioned said they had not profited from germany 's good economic times .
germany has been on an economic upswing for the past two years , with a predicted growth rate in 2007 of 2.5 percent .
unemployment in germany was 8.4 percent in september , the lowest it has been in the past 12 years .
yet despite the good economic times , germans seem relatively pessimistic about their personal gain .
while a majority of people across age , occupational and income groups said they had not benefited from the economic boom , the feeling was especially strong among low-income earners .
nine of 10 people with a household income under 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,116 -rrb- per month felt left out of the boom .
among families who made more than 3,000 euros per month , 48 percent thought that they had indeed done well for themselves during the economic good times .
in eastern germany people were more likely to have been unhappy with their personal gains -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- than in western germany -lrb- 77 percent -rrb- .
not seeing the benefits of the boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left out of the economic boom this survey comes on the heels of two recent reports which showed that german workers are not a happy bunch .
a report released by the bild newspaper in september showed that net salaries of german workers were at their lowest point in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros , the newspaper said , citing government figures .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
additionally , a survey in september commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation , found that one of three employees in germany believes it wo n't be possible to continue working until reaching retirement age .
only every eighth worker surveyed is happy with his job and working conditions .
respondents think the government could do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many taxes , many said respondents were asked what measures the german government could take to improve equality between the rich and poor .
some 85 percent supported improving unemployment benefits for those people who have worked and paid into the social security system .
seven out of 10 said they support a minimum wage .
germany 's ruling left-right coalition recently agreed to set a minimum wage for postal workers .

a us film about a german hero who plotted to kill hitler has been highly controversial - not least because of its main star , tom cruise .
on top of it all , the production firm 's now facing the ultimate nightmare . tom cruise really tried to get it right : after all the criticism surrounding his plan to film crucial scenes of his new movie at original locations - some feared that the movie shoot would dishonor a german war memorial , others simply objected because of cruise 's scientology membership - the us actor had finally received permission to film from the german government , put on his uniform and was ready to die as colonel claus graf von stauffenberg , who had been executed by the nazis for the failed attempt on hitler 's life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film material from the finance ministry seems to have survived development " shortly before we started filming … tom cruise made brief remarks and then asked for a minute of silence - out of respect for the place and out of respect for the life achievement of these people who were executed there , " german actor christian berkel , who plays one of stauffenberg 's co-conspirators , told german tabloid bild am sonntag at the time .
unlike a previous shoot at germany 's nazi-era finance ministry - where several extras got injured after falling off a truck - things seemed to go just fine .
stauffenberg 's execution was in the can and the crew moved on to less controversial locations .
a case of sabotage ?
it might have been smart to check the film material before dismantling the set .
on friday , oct .
5 , production officials confirmed reports that most of the celluloid had been damaged and that scenes would thus have to be re-shot as a result .
the only scene to survive the mysterious mess-up was apparently the actual execution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first round of filming at bendlerblock took place in september " it 's a material defect and that can happen , " a production spokeswoman said , according to german news service dpa .
berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper meanwhile reported that the rolls of film had been dipped into the wrong kind of developing agent .
the daily suggested the possibility of sabotage and quoted an unnamed expert who said that it was highly unlikely that several rolls of film would be " put into the wrong kind of soup . "
it 's also highly unlikely that opponents of the $ 80-million -lrb- 56.5 million euros -rrb- project would have done such a thing , as cruise and co. will now have to return to the so-called bendlerblock memorial in the german defense ministry for a second time . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de tom cruise marks disputed filming with moment of silence tom cruise finally filmed a bitterly disputed scene from his new world war ii film " valkyrie , " at the site of a memorial to the anti-nazi resistance on german defense ministry grounds .
-lrb- 24.09.2007 -rrb- report : tom cruise allowed to film in german defense ministry in a complete turnaround to an initial ban on us actor tom cruise to film at a berlin memorial to the men who tried to kill adolf hitler , german government officials have now reportedly changed their minds .

6 . merkel who is on a visit to south africa as part of three-nation african tour met a frail looking mandela and his wife graca machel at the offices of his foundation in johannesburg .
afterward merkel , speaking in german , said she was moved by her meeting with mandela .
" his great message us that we need peace on earth to resolve the world 's conflicts .
the many conflicts in africa that we have at the moment show that his way is the right way and we should take it to heart , " she said .
merkel says zimbabwe a " disaster " earlier , during talks with south african president mbeki , merkel said that zimbabwean president robert mugabe was residing over a " disaster " after the topic of the dictator 's possible inclusion in a forthcoming europe-africa summit was discussed during talks with south african leader thabo mbeki in pretoria friday .
" the situation is a very difficult one , " the german leader said at a joint press conference with mbeki during her first sub-saharan africa tour , referring to the current instability and persecution taking place in zimbabwe .
" it 's a disastrous one , which i very clearly stated in our conversation . "
" i have said right from the start that the president of the republic of germany wanted to invite all african countries to that summit and it 's up to countries themselves to decide how they are going to be represented at the table , " said merkel .
" i also said -lrb- to mbeki -rrb- that obviously we will make all our assessments heard .

we would do so in the presence of each and everyone and obviously each and every one has the right to attend . "

mbeki , who is a mediator between zimbabwe 's opposition and mugabe 's ruling party , assured merkel that elections in inflation-ravaged zimbabwe next year would be free and fair , saying he had detected a mood of cooperation among all sides in talks that he has hosted .
" there was a common determination to conclude them -lrb- the talks -rrb- as quickly as possible , " mbeki told reporters .
" we are confident they will reach an agreement on all of these matters so , at least as far as the political challenges are concerned , there was a united voice , " mbeki added .
" very good progress is in fact being made at the negotiations . "
mbeki confident that zimbabwe elections will be fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflation is out of control and crippling zimbabwe " both the ruling party and opposition are committed to making sure the elections are free and fair , " he added .
" next year after the elections it will be very important they take the same approach with regard to economic challenges that they together evolve a common approach . "
the talks between mugabe 's zanu-pf party and the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- have focused on constitutional changes , changes to some laws , the reconstitution of the electoral commission and the creation of conditions conducive to free and fair presidential and parliamentary elections in zimbabwe in march 2008 , mbeki said .
while zimbabwe dominated the talks between merkel and mbeki , there was time for a lighter topic , that of the 2010 world cup .
merkel pledges german support to 2010 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after initial concerns , south africa is building its world cup after presiding over the remarkably successful 2006 tournament , merkel offered germany 's assistance in making the south african event just as memorable .
" this will open up an opportunity to project a new image for your country and indeed for the continent as a whole , " she said .
" wherever we can , we would like to help you , we would like to give our contribution .
we already cooperate to a certain extent on the construction of stadiums and exchange of experience on how best to cooperate with fifa , " added merkel who later toured the site where the host stadium for the 2010 final is under construction .
mbeki thanked his german counterpart and praised germany 's hosting of last year 's event .
" we are very fortunate to be holding the fifa world cup after germany .
it enables us to draw on your success ...
we will remain in close contact about this , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a us film about a german hero who plotted to kill hitler has been highly controversial - not least because of its main star , tom cruise .
on top of it all , the production firm 's now facing the ultimate nightmare . tom cruise really tried to get it right : after all the criticism surrounding his plan to film crucial scenes of his new movie at original locations - some feared that the movie shoot would dishonor a german war memorial , others simply objected because of cruise 's scientology membership - the us actor had finally received permission to film from the german government , put on his uniform and was ready to die as colonel claus graf von stauffenberg , who had been executed by the nazis for the failed attempt on hitler 's life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film material from the finance ministry seems to have survived development " shortly before we started filming … tom cruise made brief remarks and then asked for a minute of silence - out of respect for the place and out of respect for the life achievement of these people who were executed there , " german actor christian berkel , who plays one of stauffenberg 's co-conspirators , told german tabloid bild am sonntag at the time .
unlike a previous shoot at germany 's nazi-era finance ministry - where several extras got injured after falling off a truck - things seemed to go just fine .
stauffenberg 's execution was in the can and the crew moved on to less controversial locations .
a case of sabotage ?
it might have been smart to check the film material before dismantling the set .
on friday , oct .
5 , production officials confirmed reports that most of the celluloid had been damaged and that scenes would thus have to be re-shot as a result .
the only scene to survive the mysterious mess-up was apparently the actual execution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first round of filming at bendlerblock took place in september " it 's a material defect and that can happen , " a production spokeswoman said , according to german news service dpa .
berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper meanwhile reported that the rolls of film had been dipped into the wrong kind of developing agent .
the daily suggested the possibility of sabotage and quoted an unnamed expert who said that it was highly unlikely that several rolls of film would be " put into the wrong kind of soup . "
it 's also highly unlikely that opponents of the $ 80-million -lrb- 56.5 million euros -rrb- project would have done such a thing , as cruise and co. will now have to return to the so-called bendlerblock memorial in the german defense ministry for a second time . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the revelation sparked calls from politicians that the author be stripped of his honorary citizenship in gdansk .

a us film about a german hero who plotted to kill hitler has been highly controversial - not least because of its main star , tom cruise .
on top of it all , the production firm 's now facing the ultimate nightmare . tom cruise really tried to get it right : after all the criticism surrounding his plan to film crucial scenes of his new movie at original locations - some feared that the movie shoot would dishonor a german war memorial , others simply objected because of cruise 's scientology membership - the us actor had finally received permission to film from the german government , put on his uniform and was ready to die as colonel claus graf von stauffenberg , who had been executed by the nazis for the failed attempt on hitler 's life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film material from the finance ministry seems to have survived development " shortly before we started filming … tom cruise made brief remarks and then asked for a minute of silence - out of respect for the place and out of respect for the life achievement of these people who were executed there , " german actor christian berkel , who plays one of stauffenberg 's co-conspirators , told german tabloid bild am sonntag at the time .
unlike a previous shoot at germany 's nazi-era finance ministry - where several extras got injured after falling off a truck - things seemed to go just fine .

on friday , oct .

the only scene to survive the mysterious mess-up was apparently the actual execution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first round of filming at bendlerblock took place in september " it 's a material defect and that can happen , " a production spokeswoman said , according to german news service dpa .

5 about the decision to remove a controversial photo exhibition which portrayed the horros of the war in chechnya . the removal of the exhibit from the european parliament was " monstrous " helga trupel , a german member of the european parliament told german news agency dpa . the ongoing fighting in chechnya can not be discussed without referring to its brutality , said trupel , who is a member of the greens .
the photos were taken down on tuesday , oct .
2 .
the photographs , some of which showed wounded chechens , mass graves and other atrocities from russia 's war in chechnya were deemed controversial and were removed .
" the pictures shown were of a really horrific nature , " an eu parliament spokesman said earlier this week .
organizers say removal was censorship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landsbergis said the removal of the exhibition amounts to censorship conservative former lithuanian president , vytautas landsbergis and right-wing polish deputy , konrad szymanski were the drivinng forces behind the photo exhibition , " chechnya : the final solution . "
the two had compiled photos that document the suffering in the war-torn breakaway republic .
their goal was to raise questions about russia 's human rights record ahead of a summit between the european union and russia scheduled for later in october .
the exhibit opened briefly before being shut down by quaestors , members of parliament in charge of overseeing internal regulations .
the quaestors had deemed the pictures too graphic and disturbing .
szymanski and landsbergis responded with outrage , calling the move " a dishonorable example of lawlessness and censorship " which " brings shame and moral injustice to this assembly " in a letter to eu parliament president , hans-gert pottering .
problems anticipated with exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of a deadly truck bomb in northern chechnya the place for politics is in the debating chamber or in parliamentary committees , a spokesman for pottering said .
problems had been anticipated with the exhibit earlier this spring , but the organizers had n't responded to concerns despite three reminders , said the quaestor who made the decision , szabolcs fazakas .
" i absolutely refute your statement that this issue is at the cost of parliament 's credibility or is a form of censorship ...
if your intention was really to organize this exhibition , why did n't you follow parliament 's rules ? " he asked .
chechnya has fought two separatist wars in a bid to gain independence .

not all think it 's the best way to deal with the issue . the resolution , entitled " the dangers of creationism in education , " was adopted in a vote on thursday , oct .
4 , during a plenary session of the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- .
while 48 members approved the document , 25 voted against it . based on a report on attempts to have creationism taught in science classes in europe , the resolution 's " aim is to warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science … the parliamentary assembly is worried about the possible ill-effect of the spread of creationist ideas within our education systems and about the consequences for our democracies .
if we are not careful , creationism could become a threat to human rights . " the document also urges member states to " defend and promote scientific knowledge " in schools and oppose attempts to place creationism on equal footing with charles darwin 's theory of evolution , the basis of modern biology . europe-wide cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first " creation museum " opened in the us in 2007 while creationism , which says that god created the world in six days , has been mainly propagated by christians in the united states , the pace report was initiated after a turkish muslim publishing group sent an islamic creationist book to schools in several countries , reuters news service reported . the pace report , however , cites cases of attempts to introduce creationism to science classes in several european countries , including belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , the netherlands , poland , russia , serbia , spain , sweden , switzerland , turkey and the united kingdom . in germany , the culture minister of the central state of hesse , karin wolff , a member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor angela merkel , recently made headlines when she suggested that the biblical concept of creation should be discussed during biology classes .

the pace report had already been up for a vote earlier this year , but was sent back for reworking after several conservative parliamentarians had complained about it . german cdu parliamentarian axel fischer , who voted against the resolution on thursday , said that he felt that the resolution had been sloppy and included a " negative undertone against churches . " " i missed a justification for why creationism is a threat to human rights , " he told dw-world.de , adding that he thought it was wrong to ban certain things from schools from the outset . " i 'd rather discuss the strengths and weaknesses of something and leave it up to people to decide what they believe , " said fischer , a mechanical engineer by trade . while saying that the theory of evolution explained a lot , but was unproven , he added that he was in favor of germany 's system of teaching the story of creation in religion classes and the theory of evolution in science classes . respecting religion separate from science supporters of the resolution on the other hand said that it was not meant as an attack on religious beliefs . " there are different views of the creation of the world and we respect that , " anne brasseur , a liberal parliamentarian from luxembourg , who presented the report , recently told reuters .
" the message we wanted to send was to avoid creationism passing itself off as science and being taught as science .
that 's where the danger lies .

" his great message us that we need peace on earth to resolve the world 's conflicts .
the many conflicts in africa that we have at the moment show that his way is the right way and we should take it to heart , " she said .
merkel says zimbabwe a " disaster " earlier , during talks with south african president mbeki , merkel said that zimbabwean president robert mugabe was residing over a " disaster " after the topic of the dictator 's possible inclusion in a forthcoming europe-africa summit was discussed during talks with south african leader thabo mbeki in pretoria friday .
" the situation is a very difficult one , " the german leader said at a joint press conference with mbeki during her first sub-saharan africa tour , referring to the current instability and persecution taking place in zimbabwe .
" it 's a disastrous one , which i very clearly stated in our conversation . "
" i have said right from the start that the president of the republic of germany wanted to invite all african countries to that summit and it 's up to countries themselves to decide how they are going to be represented at the table , " said merkel .
" i also said -lrb- to mbeki -rrb- that obviously we will make all our assessments heard .

" there was a common determination to conclude them -lrb- the talks -rrb- as quickly as possible , " mbeki told reporters .

we already cooperate to a certain extent on the construction of stadiums and exchange of experience on how best to cooperate with fifa , " added merkel who later toured the site where the host stadium for the 2010 final is under construction .

4 . , merkel said transparency , respecting human rights and freedom of the press were all ingredients that not only helped to stabilize nations but also helped economic development .
human rights were a key issue on the first day of merkel 's visit as she visited addis ababa , the ethiopian capital .
ethiopia has been heavily criticized by human rights organizations monitoring events there since the 2005 elections , when unrest broke out over suspected vote rigging .
a number of people were killed and many more arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and zenawi amnesty international estimated the number of political prisoners at 200 .
the press in ethiopia is still largely state controlled two years after the violence .
after his discussions with merkel , zenawi pledged renewed efforts and said his government was working toward a separation of powers between the government , parliament and judiciary .
but he said ethiopia 's path towards a democracy meeting western standards was a difficult one .
merkel confident of peaceful end to border dispute for her part , merkel said that the talks with zenawi had been " constructive , " and the chancellor added that she was confident the acrimonious border dispute between ethiopia and neighboring eritrea would be peacefully settled since ethiopia had accepted the ruling of an impartial border commission .
she also pledged germany 's help in achieving stability in the region .
" it seems that the problems are mainly in the implementation -lsb- of the border commission 's recommendations -rsb- , " she said .
" wherever we can be of any assistance , germany will certainly be ready to do so . "
she did not specify how germany could help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called on europe to do more for africa at the same time , the german leader called for stronger european efforts for africa .
saying that " europe must do more , " merkel conceded that europeans had neglected africa in recent years , but europe had done some introspection , she added self-critically .
it was " in europe 's own best interest to intensify relations , " she said .
in a speech she later gave to the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , merkel reassured her audience that promises to increase development aid by 2015 would be kept .
as current president of the group of eight leading industrial nations , merkel explained that for the promises to be kept industrial nations would have to donate 0.7 percent of their economic power .
combined au and un force to protect dafur merkel said she saw africa as a whole " in motion . "
one trend , she said , had been clear for years : " fewer conflicts , more democratic elections and peaceful transitions of power .
economic growth has increased significantly , " merkel told the au .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union should join with the un to protect sudan she also spoke of a " reform partnership " with africa based on " shared values , such as the respect for universal human rights , democracy and constitutionalism " and reiterated her recent appeal for a " common spirit " between africa and the developed world to reduce poverty , ensure respect for human rights , fight disease and improve education .
the chancellor concluded by calling for the rapid deployment of a joint peacekeeping force to war-ravaged sudan .
logistical and financial hurdles must be overcome , she said , in a bid to send a joint african union-united nations force into darfur .
" the unamid mission must come to action quickly and will hopefully lead to the desired success , " she said , while emphasizing " the central responsibility for peace , stability and security lies within africa itself . "

4 . , merkel said transparency , respecting human rights and freedom of the press were all ingredients that not only helped to stabilize nations but also helped economic development .
human rights were a key issue on the first day of merkel 's visit as she visited addis ababa , the ethiopian capital .
ethiopia has been heavily criticized by human rights organizations monitoring events there since the 2005 elections , when unrest broke out over suspected vote rigging .
a number of people were killed and many more arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and zenawi amnesty international estimated the number of political prisoners at 200 .
the press in ethiopia is still largely state controlled two years after the violence .
after his discussions with merkel , zenawi pledged renewed efforts and said his government was working toward a separation of powers between the government , parliament and judiciary .
but he said ethiopia 's path towards a democracy meeting western standards was a difficult one .
merkel confident of peaceful end to border dispute for her part , merkel said that the talks with zenawi had been " constructive , " and the chancellor added that she was confident the acrimonious border dispute between ethiopia and neighboring eritrea would be peacefully settled since ethiopia had accepted the ruling of an impartial border commission .
she also pledged germany 's help in achieving stability in the region .
" it seems that the problems are mainly in the implementation -lsb- of the border commission 's recommendations -rsb- , " she said .
" wherever we can be of any assistance , germany will certainly be ready to do so . "
she did not specify how germany could help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called on europe to do more for africa at the same time , the german leader called for stronger european efforts for africa .
saying that " europe must do more , " merkel conceded that europeans had neglected africa in recent years , but europe had done some introspection , she added self-critically .
it was " in europe 's own best interest to intensify relations , " she said .
in a speech she later gave to the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , merkel reassured her audience that promises to increase development aid by 2015 would be kept .
as current president of the group of eight leading industrial nations , merkel explained that for the promises to be kept industrial nations would have to donate 0.7 percent of their economic power .
combined au and un force to protect dafur merkel said she saw africa as a whole " in motion . "
one trend , she said , had been clear for years : " fewer conflicts , more democratic elections and peaceful transitions of power .
economic growth has increased significantly , " merkel told the au .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union should join with the un to protect sudan she also spoke of a " reform partnership " with africa based on " shared values , such as the respect for universal human rights , democracy and constitutionalism " and reiterated her recent appeal for a " common spirit " between africa and the developed world to reduce poverty , ensure respect for human rights , fight disease and improve education .
the chancellor concluded by calling for the rapid deployment of a joint peacekeeping force to war-ravaged sudan .
logistical and financial hurdles must be overcome , she said , in a bid to send a joint african union-united nations force into darfur .
" the unamid mission must come to action quickly and will hopefully lead to the desired success , " she said , while emphasizing " the central responsibility for peace , stability and security lies within africa itself . "
merkel traveled on to johannesburg , south africa , on thursday evening and is to meet president thabo mbeki on friday .

4 , during a plenary session of the council of europe parliamentary assembly -lrb- pace -rrb- .
while 48 members approved the document , 25 voted against it . based on a report on attempts to have creationism taught in science classes in europe , the resolution 's " aim is to warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science … the parliamentary assembly is worried about the possible ill-effect of the spread of creationist ideas within our education systems and about the consequences for our democracies .
if we are not careful , creationism could become a threat to human rights . " the document also urges member states to " defend and promote scientific knowledge " in schools and oppose attempts to place creationism on equal footing with charles darwin 's theory of evolution , the basis of modern biology . europe-wide cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first " creation museum " opened in the us in 2007 while creationism , which says that god created the world in six days , has been mainly propagated by christians in the united states , the pace report was initiated after a turkish muslim publishing group sent an islamic creationist book to schools in several countries , reuters news service reported . the pace report , however , cites cases of attempts to introduce creationism to science classes in several european countries , including belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , the netherlands , poland , russia , serbia , spain , sweden , switzerland , turkey and the united kingdom . in germany , the culture minister of the central state of hesse , karin wolff , a member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor angela merkel , recently made headlines when she suggested that the biblical concept of creation should be discussed during biology classes .

the pace report had already been up for a vote earlier this year , but was sent back for reworking after several conservative parliamentarians had complained about it . german cdu parliamentarian axel fischer , who voted against the resolution on thursday , said that he felt that the resolution had been sloppy and included a " negative undertone against churches . " " i missed a justification for why creationism is a threat to human rights , " he told dw-world.de , adding that he thought it was wrong to ban certain things from schools from the outset . " i 'd rather discuss the strengths and weaknesses of something and leave it up to people to decide what they believe , " said fischer , a mechanical engineer by trade . while saying that the theory of evolution explained a lot , but was unproven , he added that he was in favor of germany 's system of teaching the story of creation in religion classes and the theory of evolution in science classes . respecting religion separate from science supporters of the resolution on the other hand said that it was not meant as an attack on religious beliefs . " there are different views of the creation of the world and we respect that , " anne brasseur , a liberal parliamentarian from luxembourg , who presented the report , recently told reuters .
" the message we wanted to send was to avoid creationism passing itself off as science and being taught as science .
that 's where the danger lies . " the resolution is not binding for member states , but pace decisions carry some weight , as the body is made up of parliamentarians from the national assemblies of member states . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the revelation sparked calls from politicians that the author be stripped of his honorary citizenship in gdansk .
grass responded in a letter to the city 's mayor in which he said that only in his old age did he find the " right formula " to talk about serving in the ss .

" it 's a disastrous one , which i very clearly stated in our conversation . "

those polled said they supported minimum wage requirements , better unemployment benefits and fewer taxes . the survey , conducted at the beginning of october , was commissioned by the public broadcaster ard .
a full 78 percent of german voters who were questioned said they had not profited from germany 's good economic times .
germany has been on an economic upswing for the past two years , with a predicted growth rate in 2007 of 2.5 percent .
unemployment in germany was 8.4 percent in september , the lowest it has been in the past 12 years .
yet despite the good economic times , germans seem relatively pessimistic about their personal gain .
while a majority of people across age , occupational and income groups said they had not benefited from the economic boom , the feeling was especially strong among low-income earners .
nine of 10 people with a household income under 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,116 -rrb- per month felt left out of the boom .
among families who made more than 3,000 euros per month , 48 percent thought that they had indeed done well for themselves during the economic good times .

not seeing the benefits of the boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left out of the economic boom this survey comes on the heels of two recent reports which showed that german workers are not a happy bunch .
a report released by the bild newspaper in september showed that net salaries of german workers were at their lowest point in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros , the newspaper said , citing government figures .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
additionally , a survey in september commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation , found that one of three employees in germany believes it wo n't be possible to continue working until reaching retirement age .
only every eighth worker surveyed is happy with his job and working conditions .
respondents think the government could do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many taxes , many said respondents were asked what measures the german government could take to improve equality between the rich and poor .
some 85 percent supported improving unemployment benefits for those people who have worked and paid into the social security system .
seven out of 10 said they support a minimum wage .
germany 's ruling left-right coalition recently agreed to set a minimum wage for postal workers .
but the coalition ca n't agree on whether to institute a general minimum wage or limit it to certain industrial sectors .
respondents also felt the government could ease the tax burden , with 61 percent of respondents saying it would help improve equality .

those polled said they supported minimum wage requirements , better unemployment benefits and fewer taxes . the survey , conducted at the beginning of october , was commissioned by the public broadcaster ard .
a full 78 percent of german voters who were questioned said they had not profited from germany 's good economic times .
germany has been on an economic upswing for the past two years , with a predicted growth rate in 2007 of 2.5 percent .
unemployment in germany was 8.4 percent in september , the lowest it has been in the past 12 years .
yet despite the good economic times , germans seem relatively pessimistic about their personal gain .
while a majority of people across age , occupational and income groups said they had not benefited from the economic boom , the feeling was especially strong among low-income earners .
nine of 10 people with a household income under 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,116 -rrb- per month felt left out of the boom .
among families who made more than 3,000 euros per month , 48 percent thought that they had indeed done well for themselves during the economic good times .
in eastern germany people were more likely to have been unhappy with their personal gains -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- than in western germany -lrb- 77 percent -rrb- .
not seeing the benefits of the boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left out of the economic boom this survey comes on the heels of two recent reports which showed that german workers are not a happy bunch .
a report released by the bild newspaper in september showed that net salaries of german workers were at their lowest point in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros , the newspaper said , citing government figures .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
additionally , a survey in september commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation , found that one of three employees in germany believes it wo n't be possible to continue working until reaching retirement age .
only every eighth worker surveyed is happy with his job and working conditions .
respondents think the government could do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many taxes , many said respondents were asked what measures the german government could take to improve equality between the rich and poor .
some 85 percent supported improving unemployment benefits for those people who have worked and paid into the social security system .
seven out of 10 said they support a minimum wage .
germany 's ruling left-right coalition recently agreed to set a minimum wage for postal workers .
but the coalition ca n't agree on whether to institute a general minimum wage or limit it to certain industrial sectors .
respondents also felt the government could ease the tax burden , with 61 percent of respondents saying it would help improve equality .
the survey , done by infratest dimap for ard , questioned more than 1,000 eligible voters . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

problems had been anticipated with the exhibit earlier this spring , but the organizers had n't responded to concerns despite three reminders , said the quaestor who made the decision , szabolcs fazakas .
" i absolutely refute your statement that this issue is at the cost of parliament 's credibility or is a form of censorship ...
if your intention was really to organize this exhibition , why did n't you follow parliament 's rules ? " he asked .

a us film about a german hero who plotted to kill hitler has been highly controversial - not least because of its main star , tom cruise .
on top of it all , the production firm 's now facing the ultimate nightmare . tom cruise really tried to get it right : after all the criticism surrounding his plan to film crucial scenes of his new movie at original locations - some feared that the movie shoot would dishonor a german war memorial , others simply objected because of cruise 's scientology membership - the us actor had finally received permission to film from the german government , put on his uniform and was ready to die as colonel claus graf von stauffenberg , who had been executed by the nazis for the failed attempt on hitler 's life .

the contingency plans aimed to keep half of the country 's 19,000 regional trains and two of every three long-distance trains operating , according to a deutsche bahn spokesman .

4 . , merkel said transparency , respecting human rights and freedom of the press were all ingredients that not only helped to stabilize nations but also helped economic development .
human rights were a key issue on the first day of merkel 's visit as she visited addis ababa , the ethiopian capital .
ethiopia has been heavily criticized by human rights organizations monitoring events there since the 2005 elections , when unrest broke out over suspected vote rigging .
a number of people were killed and many more arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and zenawi amnesty international estimated the number of political prisoners at 200 .
the press in ethiopia is still largely state controlled two years after the violence .
after his discussions with merkel , zenawi pledged renewed efforts and said his government was working toward a separation of powers between the government , parliament and judiciary .
but he said ethiopia 's path towards a democracy meeting western standards was a difficult one .
merkel confident of peaceful end to border dispute for her part , merkel said that the talks with zenawi had been " constructive , " and the chancellor added that she was confident the acrimonious border dispute between ethiopia and neighboring eritrea would be peacefully settled since ethiopia had accepted the ruling of an impartial border commission .
she also pledged germany 's help in achieving stability in the region .
" it seems that the problems are mainly in the implementation -lsb- of the border commission 's recommendations -rsb- , " she said .
" wherever we can be of any assistance , germany will certainly be ready to do so . "
she did not specify how germany could help .

saying that " europe must do more , " merkel conceded that europeans had neglected africa in recent years , but europe had done some introspection , she added self-critically .
it was " in europe 's own best interest to intensify relations , " she said .
in a speech she later gave to the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , merkel reassured her audience that promises to increase development aid by 2015 would be kept .
as current president of the group of eight leading industrial nations , merkel explained that for the promises to be kept industrial nations would have to donate 0.7 percent of their economic power .
combined au and un force to protect dafur merkel said she saw africa as a whole " in motion . "
one trend , she said , had been clear for years : " fewer conflicts , more democratic elections and peaceful transitions of power .
economic growth has increased significantly , " merkel told the au .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union should join with the un to protect sudan she also spoke of a " reform partnership " with africa based on " shared values , such as the respect for universal human rights , democracy and constitutionalism " and reiterated her recent appeal for a " common spirit " between africa and the developed world to reduce poverty , ensure respect for human rights , fight disease and improve education .
the chancellor concluded by calling for the rapid deployment of a joint peacekeeping force to war-ravaged sudan .
logistical and financial hurdles must be overcome , she said , in a bid to send a joint african union-united nations force into darfur .
" the unamid mission must come to action quickly and will hopefully lead to the desired success , " she said , while emphasizing " the central responsibility for peace , stability and security lies within africa itself . "

4 . , merkel said transparency , respecting human rights and freedom of the press were all ingredients that not only helped to stabilize nations but also helped economic development .
human rights were a key issue on the first day of merkel 's visit as she visited addis ababa , the ethiopian capital .
ethiopia has been heavily criticized by human rights organizations monitoring events there since the 2005 elections , when unrest broke out over suspected vote rigging .
a number of people were killed and many more arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and zenawi amnesty international estimated the number of political prisoners at 200 .
the press in ethiopia is still largely state controlled two years after the violence .
after his discussions with merkel , zenawi pledged renewed efforts and said his government was working toward a separation of powers between the government , parliament and judiciary .
but he said ethiopia 's path towards a democracy meeting western standards was a difficult one .
merkel confident of peaceful end to border dispute for her part , merkel said that the talks with zenawi had been " constructive , " and the chancellor added that she was confident the acrimonious border dispute between ethiopia and neighboring eritrea would be peacefully settled since ethiopia had accepted the ruling of an impartial border commission .
she also pledged germany 's help in achieving stability in the region .
" it seems that the problems are mainly in the implementation -lsb- of the border commission 's recommendations -rsb- , " she said .
" wherever we can be of any assistance , germany will certainly be ready to do so . "
she did not specify how germany could help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called on europe to do more for africa at the same time , the german leader called for stronger european efforts for africa .
saying that " europe must do more , " merkel conceded that europeans had neglected africa in recent years , but europe had done some introspection , she added self-critically .
it was " in europe 's own best interest to intensify relations , " she said .
in a speech she later gave to the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , merkel reassured her audience that promises to increase development aid by 2015 would be kept .
as current president of the group of eight leading industrial nations , merkel explained that for the promises to be kept industrial nations would have to donate 0.7 percent of their economic power .
combined au and un force to protect dafur merkel said she saw africa as a whole " in motion . "
one trend , she said , had been clear for years : " fewer conflicts , more democratic elections and peaceful transitions of power .
economic growth has increased significantly , " merkel told the au .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union should join with the un to protect sudan she also spoke of a " reform partnership " with africa based on " shared values , such as the respect for universal human rights , democracy and constitutionalism " and reiterated her recent appeal for a " common spirit " between africa and the developed world to reduce poverty , ensure respect for human rights , fight disease and improve education .

the attack follows a similar one in july in which three senior german police officers were killed when their vehicles were hit by a roadside bomb on the eastern outskirts of kabul .
in may , three bundeswehr soldiers were killed and two others wounded when a bomb went off in a crowded bazaar in kabul .

" his great message us that we need peace on earth to resolve the world 's conflicts .
the many conflicts in africa that we have at the moment show that his way is the right way and we should take it to heart , " she said .
merkel says zimbabwe a " disaster " earlier , during talks with south african president mbeki , merkel said that zimbabwean president robert mugabe was residing over a " disaster " after the topic of the dictator 's possible inclusion in a forthcoming europe-africa summit was discussed during talks with south african leader thabo mbeki in pretoria friday .
" the situation is a very difficult one , " the german leader said at a joint press conference with mbeki during her first sub-saharan africa tour , referring to the current instability and persecution taking place in zimbabwe .
" it 's a disastrous one , which i very clearly stated in our conversation . "

5 about the decision to remove a controversial photo exhibition which portrayed the horros of the war in chechnya . the removal of the exhibit from the european parliament was " monstrous " helga trupel , a german member of the european parliament told german news agency dpa . the ongoing fighting in chechnya can not be discussed without referring to its brutality , said trupel , who is a member of the greens .
the photos were taken down on tuesday , oct .
2 .
the photographs , some of which showed wounded chechens , mass graves and other atrocities from russia 's war in chechnya were deemed controversial and were removed .
" the pictures shown were of a really horrific nature , " an eu parliament spokesman said earlier this week .
organizers say removal was censorship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landsbergis said the removal of the exhibition amounts to censorship conservative former lithuanian president , vytautas landsbergis and right-wing polish deputy , konrad szymanski were the drivinng forces behind the photo exhibition , " chechnya : the final solution . "
the two had compiled photos that document the suffering in the war-torn breakaway republic .
their goal was to raise questions about russia 's human rights record ahead of a summit between the european union and russia scheduled for later in october .
the exhibit opened briefly before being shut down by quaestors , members of parliament in charge of overseeing internal regulations .
the quaestors had deemed the pictures too graphic and disturbing .
szymanski and landsbergis responded with outrage , calling the move " a dishonorable example of lawlessness and censorship " which " brings shame and moral injustice to this assembly " in a letter to eu parliament president , hans-gert pottering .

not everyone was pleased to see him . on the second of a three-day celebration making the 80th birthday of german nobel laureate günter grass , the party in the author 's birth city of gdansk was marred by polish conservatives who threatened to strip grass of his citizenship should prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski be re-elected .
grass , who actually celebrates his birthday on oct .
16 , angered and shocked conservative poles when he admitted in august 2006 that he had been a member of the nazi waffen ss during world war ii , a secret the writer had kept for more than half a century .
the revelation sparked calls from politicians that the author be stripped of his honorary citizenship in gdansk .
grass responded in a letter to the city 's mayor in which he said that only in his old age did he find the " right formula " to talk about serving in the ss .
the mayor accepted grass ' explanation , and the author kept his honorary citizenship of the city .
however , the prospect of the citizenship being stripped has once again been raised as grass continues to rile the country 's conservatives .
polish government criticized by grass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass hopes prime minister kaczynski is not re-elected grass caused more offense earlier this year by describing the polish government as a " misfortune " and saying he hoped prime minister kaczynski would fail at the coming elections which have been called two years ahead of schedule after the collapse of the country 's conservative-led coalition .
he did little to distance himself from the controversy thursday when he called for a massive turn-out in the coming vote on october 21 in the hope that a new government would be chosen by the people .
" i am happy to be able to come here and meet my friends on the eve of my birthday , " grass said to an ecstatic crowd in gdansk .

when he was born in 1927 , gdansk was known as the free city of danzig , after having been carved out of the defeated german empire following world war i. the city was awarded to poland after world war ii , when its mainly german-speaking inhabitants - including the young grass - fled or were expelled .
since beginning a new life in germany , grass has long been seen as a beacon in the process of post-world war ii polish-german reconciliation .
his best known and nobel-winning novel " the tin drum " -lrb- 1959 -rrb- is set in danzig and cologne in the 1920s through to the 1950s and is considered one of the finest examples of german post-war literature .

grass , who actually celebrates his birthday on oct .
16 , angered and shocked conservative poles when he admitted in august 2006 that he had been a member of the nazi waffen ss during world war ii , a secret the writer had kept for more than half a century .
the revelation sparked calls from politicians that the author be stripped of his honorary citizenship in gdansk .
grass responded in a letter to the city 's mayor in which he said that only in his old age did he find the " right formula " to talk about serving in the ss .
the mayor accepted grass ' explanation , and the author kept his honorary citizenship of the city .
however , the prospect of the citizenship being stripped has once again been raised as grass continues to rile the country 's conservatives .
polish government criticized by grass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass hopes prime minister kaczynski is not re-elected grass caused more offense earlier this year by describing the polish government as a " misfortune " and saying he hoped prime minister kaczynski would fail at the coming elections which have been called two years ahead of schedule after the collapse of the country 's conservative-led coalition .
he did little to distance himself from the controversy thursday when he called for a massive turn-out in the coming vote on october 21 in the hope that a new government would be chosen by the people .
" i am happy to be able to come here and meet my friends on the eve of my birthday , " grass said to an ecstatic crowd in gdansk .

since beginning a new life in germany , grass has long been seen as a beacon in the process of post-world war ii polish-german reconciliation .
his best known and nobel-winning novel " the tin drum " -lrb- 1959 -rrb- is set in danzig and cologne in the 1920s through to the 1950s and is considered one of the finest examples of german post-war literature .

a us film about a german hero who plotted to kill hitler has been highly controversial - not least because of its main star , tom cruise .
on top of it all , the production firm 's now facing the ultimate nightmare . tom cruise really tried to get it right : after all the criticism surrounding his plan to film crucial scenes of his new movie at original locations - some feared that the movie shoot would dishonor a german war memorial , others simply objected because of cruise 's scientology membership - the us actor had finally received permission to film from the german government , put on his uniform and was ready to die as colonel claus graf von stauffenberg , who had been executed by the nazis for the failed attempt on hitler 's life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film material from the finance ministry seems to have survived development " shortly before we started filming … tom cruise made brief remarks and then asked for a minute of silence - out of respect for the place and out of respect for the life achievement of these people who were executed there , " german actor christian berkel , who plays one of stauffenberg 's co-conspirators , told german tabloid bild am sonntag at the time .
unlike a previous shoot at germany 's nazi-era finance ministry - where several extras got injured after falling off a truck - things seemed to go just fine .

a us film about a german hero who plotted to kill hitler has been highly controversial - not least because of its main star , tom cruise .
on top of it all , the production firm 's now facing the ultimate nightmare . tom cruise really tried to get it right : after all the criticism surrounding his plan to film crucial scenes of his new movie at original locations - some feared that the movie shoot would dishonor a german war memorial , others simply objected because of cruise 's scientology membership - the us actor had finally received permission to film from the german government , put on his uniform and was ready to die as colonel claus graf von stauffenberg , who had been executed by the nazis for the failed attempt on hitler 's life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film material from the finance ministry seems to have survived development " shortly before we started filming … tom cruise made brief remarks and then asked for a minute of silence - out of respect for the place and out of respect for the life achievement of these people who were executed there , " german actor christian berkel , who plays one of stauffenberg 's co-conspirators , told german tabloid bild am sonntag at the time .
unlike a previous shoot at germany 's nazi-era finance ministry - where several extras got injured after falling off a truck - things seemed to go just fine .
stauffenberg 's execution was in the can and the crew moved on to less controversial locations .
a case of sabotage ?
it might have been smart to check the film material before dismantling the set .
on friday , oct .

the only scene to survive the mysterious mess-up was apparently the actual execution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first round of filming at bendlerblock took place in september " it 's a material defect and that can happen , " a production spokeswoman said , according to german news service dpa .
berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper meanwhile reported that the rolls of film had been dipped into the wrong kind of developing agent .
the daily suggested the possibility of sabotage and quoted an unnamed expert who said that it was highly unlikely that several rolls of film would be " put into the wrong kind of soup . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.10.2007 germans feel left out of economic boom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans feel their hard work has n't been rewarded a vast majority of germans feel the economic boom has passed them by , according to a recent survey .
those polled said they supported minimum wage requirements , better unemployment benefits and fewer taxes . the survey , conducted at the beginning of october , was commissioned by the public broadcaster ard .
a full 78 percent of german voters who were questioned said they had not profited from germany 's good economic times .
germany has been on an economic upswing for the past two years , with a predicted growth rate in 2007 of 2.5 percent .
unemployment in germany was 8.4 percent in september , the lowest it has been in the past 12 years .
yet despite the good economic times , germans seem relatively pessimistic about their personal gain .
while a majority of people across age , occupational and income groups said they had not benefited from the economic boom , the feeling was especially strong among low-income earners .
nine of 10 people with a household income under 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,116 -rrb- per month felt left out of the boom .
among families who made more than 3,000 euros per month , 48 percent thought that they had indeed done well for themselves during the economic good times .
in eastern germany people were more likely to have been unhappy with their personal gains -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- than in western germany -lrb- 77 percent -rrb- .
not seeing the benefits of the boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left out of the economic boom this survey comes on the heels of two recent reports which showed that german workers are not a happy bunch .
a report released by the bild newspaper in september showed that net salaries of german workers were at their lowest point in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros , the newspaper said , citing government figures .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
additionally , a survey in september commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation , found that one of three employees in germany believes it wo n't be possible to continue working until reaching retirement age .
only every eighth worker surveyed is happy with his job and working conditions .
respondents think the government could do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many taxes , many said respondents were asked what measures the german government could take to improve equality between the rich and poor .
some 85 percent supported improving unemployment benefits for those people who have worked and paid into the social security system .
seven out of 10 said they support a minimum wage .
germany 's ruling left-right coalition recently agreed to set a minimum wage for postal workers .
but the coalition ca n't agree on whether to institute a general minimum wage or limit it to certain industrial sectors .

those polled said they supported minimum wage requirements , better unemployment benefits and fewer taxes . the survey , conducted at the beginning of october , was commissioned by the public broadcaster ard .
a full 78 percent of german voters who were questioned said they had not profited from germany 's good economic times .
germany has been on an economic upswing for the past two years , with a predicted growth rate in 2007 of 2.5 percent .
unemployment in germany was 8.4 percent in september , the lowest it has been in the past 12 years .
yet despite the good economic times , germans seem relatively pessimistic about their personal gain .
while a majority of people across age , occupational and income groups said they had not benefited from the economic boom , the feeling was especially strong among low-income earners .
nine of 10 people with a household income under 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,116 -rrb- per month felt left out of the boom .
among families who made more than 3,000 euros per month , 48 percent thought that they had indeed done well for themselves during the economic good times .
in eastern germany people were more likely to have been unhappy with their personal gains -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- than in western germany -lrb- 77 percent -rrb- .
not seeing the benefits of the boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left out of the economic boom this survey comes on the heels of two recent reports which showed that german workers are not a happy bunch .
a report released by the bild newspaper in september showed that net salaries of german workers were at their lowest point in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros , the newspaper said , citing government figures .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
additionally , a survey in september commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation , found that one of three employees in germany believes it wo n't be possible to continue working until reaching retirement age .
only every eighth worker surveyed is happy with his job and working conditions .
respondents think the government could do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many taxes , many said respondents were asked what measures the german government could take to improve equality between the rich and poor .
some 85 percent supported improving unemployment benefits for those people who have worked and paid into the social security system .
seven out of 10 said they support a minimum wage .
germany 's ruling left-right coalition recently agreed to set a minimum wage for postal workers .

those polled said they supported minimum wage requirements , better unemployment benefits and fewer taxes . the survey , conducted at the beginning of october , was commissioned by the public broadcaster ard .
a full 78 percent of german voters who were questioned said they had not profited from germany 's good economic times .
germany has been on an economic upswing for the past two years , with a predicted growth rate in 2007 of 2.5 percent .
unemployment in germany was 8.4 percent in september , the lowest it has been in the past 12 years .
yet despite the good economic times , germans seem relatively pessimistic about their personal gain .
while a majority of people across age , occupational and income groups said they had not benefited from the economic boom , the feeling was especially strong among low-income earners .
nine of 10 people with a household income under 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,116 -rrb- per month felt left out of the boom .
among families who made more than 3,000 euros per month , 48 percent thought that they had indeed done well for themselves during the economic good times .
in eastern germany people were more likely to have been unhappy with their personal gains -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- than in western germany -lrb- 77 percent -rrb- .
not seeing the benefits of the boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left out of the economic boom this survey comes on the heels of two recent reports which showed that german workers are not a happy bunch .
a report released by the bild newspaper in september showed that net salaries of german workers were at their lowest point in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros , the newspaper said , citing government figures .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
additionally , a survey in september commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation , found that one of three employees in germany believes it wo n't be possible to continue working until reaching retirement age .
only every eighth worker surveyed is happy with his job and working conditions .
respondents think the government could do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many taxes , many said respondents were asked what measures the german government could take to improve equality between the rich and poor .
some 85 percent supported improving unemployment benefits for those people who have worked and paid into the social security system .
seven out of 10 said they support a minimum wage .
germany 's ruling left-right coalition recently agreed to set a minimum wage for postal workers .
but the coalition ca n't agree on whether to institute a general minimum wage or limit it to certain industrial sectors .
respondents also felt the government could ease the tax burden , with 61 percent of respondents saying it would help improve equality .

while 48 members approved the document , 25 voted against it . based on a report on attempts to have creationism taught in science classes in europe , the resolution 's " aim is to warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science … the parliamentary assembly is worried about the possible ill-effect of the spread of creationist ideas within our education systems and about the consequences for our democracies .

" i 'd rather discuss the strengths and weaknesses of something and leave it up to people to decide what they believe , " said fischer , a mechanical engineer by trade . while saying that the theory of evolution explained a lot , but was unproven , he added that he was in favor of germany 's system of teaching the story of creation in religion classes and the theory of evolution in science classes . respecting religion separate from science supporters of the resolution on the other hand said that it was not meant as an attack on religious beliefs .

5 , in a strike over wages .
despite contingency plans , delays were reported during the morning commute . train drivers went on a three-hour strike across germany starting at 8 a.m.
friday morning , complicating the morning commute .
in some german cities , such as stuttgart , two commuter train lines had been closed for lack of drivers and many regional trains had also been either delayed or cancelled .
in other cities , strike contingency plans put into place by germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn kept trains running , although less frequently .
the contingency plans aimed to keep half of the country 's 19,000 regional trains and two of every three long-distance trains operating , according to a deutsche bahn spokesman .
some drivers are not members of the union , allowing deutsche bahn to staff some of its most important commuter routes .
in germany 's industrial heartland of north rhine-westphalia , commuters seemed to have taken other modes of transportation .
commuter trains in essen , bochum and dortmund were relatively empty as the strike got underway friday morning .
drawn-out wage dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for a connection deutsche bahn has been in a months-long wage dispute with the german train drivers ' union , gdl .
the union says its members are underpaid when compared with train drivers elsewhere in europe .
in june , two larger unions representing 134,000 workers launched a series of small strikes .
deutsche bahn eventually agreed to give them an inflation-beating 4.5-percent pay increase .
the gdl broke ranks with the two other rail unions and rejected the deal . the union wants a separate labor contract and a pay raise of up to 31 percent .
the two sides held new talks in september to try to come to an agreement on wages , but have been unable to reach a compromise .
" if they do n't do this , then they should prepare for another battle with labor , " union boss manfred schell said .
long-distance trains barred from striking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a court ruled that freight train drivers could n't strike a labor court in the eastern german city of chemnitz ruled early friday morning that long-distance trains could not be included in the strike due to concerns that it would harm the economy .
the strike would have to be limited to local trains , the court ruled .
schell welcomed the green light the court gave to go ahead and strike on local trains , but said the drivers felt other trains should have been included in the strike as well .
" we can not comprehend why we ca n't strike on freight and long-distance lines , " he said after the court ruling .
deutsche bahn carries 5 million passengers each day and is an important engine of the german economy .
transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has warned that a drawn-out strike could have " disastrous consequences " for germany 's economic upswing . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the soldiers have already been discharged from hospital , the german military said in afghanistan .
but it remained unclear whether the incident was a targeted attack as it could also have been an anti-tank mine , sources added .
the attack follows a similar one in july in which three senior german police officers were killed when their vehicles were hit by a roadside bomb on the eastern outskirts of kabul .
in may , three bundeswehr soldiers were killed and two others wounded when a bomb went off in a crowded bazaar in kabul .
twenty-four german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 .

" several coalition force members were wounded as a result of heavy fighting , " a coalition statement said .
the statement said afghan and coalition forces responded with small-arms fire and precision-guided munitions , destroying the building housing the militants while some damage occurred to other buildings on the compound .

not everyone was pleased to see him . on the second of a three-day celebration making the 80th birthday of german nobel laureate günter grass , the party in the author 's birth city of gdansk was marred by polish conservatives who threatened to strip grass of his citizenship should prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski be re-elected .
grass , who actually celebrates his birthday on oct .
16 , angered and shocked conservative poles when he admitted in august 2006 that he had been a member of the nazi waffen ss during world war ii , a secret the writer had kept for more than half a century .
the revelation sparked calls from politicians that the author be stripped of his honorary citizenship in gdansk .
grass responded in a letter to the city 's mayor in which he said that only in his old age did he find the " right formula " to talk about serving in the ss .
the mayor accepted grass ' explanation , and the author kept his honorary citizenship of the city .
however , the prospect of the citizenship being stripped has once again been raised as grass continues to rile the country 's conservatives .
polish government criticized by grass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass hopes prime minister kaczynski is not re-elected grass caused more offense earlier this year by describing the polish government as a " misfortune " and saying he hoped prime minister kaczynski would fail at the coming elections which have been called two years ahead of schedule after the collapse of the country 's conservative-led coalition .
he did little to distance himself from the controversy thursday when he called for a massive turn-out in the coming vote on october 21 in the hope that a new government would be chosen by the people .
" i am happy to be able to come here and meet my friends on the eve of my birthday , " grass said to an ecstatic crowd in gdansk .
" a huge turn out in the elections would be the most beautiful gift for me , " he added .
gdansk 's favorite son - despite nazi admission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass writes about his ss career in " skinning the onion " despite his nazi admission , grass is still the city 's favorite son .
when he was born in 1927 , gdansk was known as the free city of danzig , after having been carved out of the defeated german empire following world war i. the city was awarded to poland after world war ii , when its mainly german-speaking inhabitants - including the young grass - fled or were expelled .
since beginning a new life in germany , grass has long been seen as a beacon in the process of post-world war ii polish-german reconciliation .
his best known and nobel-winning novel " the tin drum " -lrb- 1959 -rrb- is set in danzig and cologne in the 1920s through to the 1950s and is considered one of the finest examples of german post-war literature .
conservatives protest celebration , honorary citizenship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have often stirred anti-german feeling however , not all poles are fans .
despite being invited by the gdansk municipality , which is controlled by poland 's liberal opposition , city councilors from poland 's governing conservative-nationalist law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party voiced their objection to the festivities in grass ' honor .
" it 's outrageous to spend so much money , " pis councilor kazimierz koralewski was quoted as saying by polish radio .
" grass does n't enjoy the respect of germans or of polish people any more , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the soldiers have already been discharged from hospital , the german military said in afghanistan .
but it remained unclear whether the incident was a targeted attack as it could also have been an anti-tank mine , sources added .
the attack follows a similar one in july in which three senior german police officers were killed when their vehicles were hit by a roadside bomb on the eastern outskirts of kabul .
in may , three bundeswehr soldiers were killed and two others wounded when a bomb went off in a crowded bazaar in kabul .
twenty-four german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 .
in a separate incident , one soldier serving in nato-led international forces was killed and two wounded in an explosion in southern afghanistan while several militants were killed after they attacked foreign soldiers , officials said friday .

us , british , dutch and canadian soldiers dominate the foreign forces based in afghanistan 's southern provinces .
germany has 3,000 troops in the north of afghanistan as part of the isaf 's reconstruction mission as well as six tornado reconnaissance jets and their crews .
afghan and us-led coalition forces also killed " several militants " friday in the south-eastern province of paktika , a coalition official said .
a military statement released from the us base at bagram outside kabul said afghan and coalition forces were on a search operation in waza khawa district and came under attack by taliban militants .

the kaguya orbiter was launched last month from japan 's space base on the southern island of tanegashima .
it will deploy two smaller satellites and , over a year , gather data on the moon 's origin and evolution .
japanese scientists say it is the most complex lunar mission since nasa 's apollo programme in the 1960s and 70s , when astronauts walked on the moon .
" we believe this is a big step , " said yoshisada takizawa , a project manager at japan 's aerospace exploration agency -lrb- jaxa -rrb- .
" everything is going well and we are confident . "
space race the three-tonne probe is formally called selene , the selenological and engineering explorer .
its nickname , kaguya , refers to a princess in a folk story who ascended to the moon .
the main orbiting unit will ultimately be positioned 100km -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- above the surface of the moon , while two smaller satellites will be deployed in polar orbits .
they will collect data on the moon 's geology , topography and environment , japan 's space agency said .
engineers confirmed that the main unit had entered lunar orbit early on friday , mr takizawa said .
it will gradually move into a lower orbit as it maps the moon 's surface .
the data collection phase of the mission will begin in mid-december , he said .
japan launched its first satellite in 1970 , but in recent years its space programme has been hit by technical and financial problems .
it trails china , which in 2003 became the first asian country to put an astronaut in space .
both china and india are expected to launch lunar probes in the next few months .
so jaxa has been working to expand its activities - its stated aim is to achieve manned space flight by 2020 .

the next couple of weeks are , traditionally , some of the busiest the skipton countryside is stunning .
craggy green hills , cloaked in hazy mist on an otherwise clear , golden , autumn day in yorkshire .
the sheep in the fields , to an outsider , look like attractive additions but to the farmers , they are the visible signs of impending ruin .
it 's believed the word skipton is derived from the anglo-saxon word for sheep - which gives a good idea of how important the animals have been for the town 's prosperity .
they once brought wealth and prestige .
but now , most farmers find it hard to make a living from livestock .
with the restrictions imposed as a result of foot-and-mouth , they say that has now become nigh on impossible .
restriction worries the outbreak could not have come at a worse time for british livestock farmers .
restricted areas foot-and-mouth risk areas : west sussex , hampshire , surrey , berkshire , hertfordshire , oxfordshire , greater london and buckinghamshire fmd low risk area : the rest of england , wales and scotland bluetongue controls : suffolk , parts of norfolk , essex and cambridgeshire animal markets back the next couple of weeks are traditionally some of the busiest of the year , with hill farmers making the bulk of their annual profit at the autumn sales .
they sell on " store lambs " to other buyers who will keep them - as well as breeding ewes - until they themselves sell them on in february or march .
government vets are doing what they can to make sure that the restrictions do not destroy the very thing they are trying to save .
britain is now divided into " risk " and " low risk " areas , in terms of foot-and-mouth , as well as a protection zone around previously-infected farms in surrey .
the foot-and-mouth low risk area includes all of england , scotland and wales , apart from south-east england and the home counties .
sing-song tally although quiet , the first day of the sales in skipton did have a buzz about them if only because they 're the first such sales in several weeks .
the selling season 's been compressed into a few weeks .
farmers are running out of feed and running out of money farmer russell toothill farmers , their faces lined from years of hard work outdoors , leant along the rails of the livestock ring , flat caps in hand or on head , making bids in a way so imperceptible they were only obvious to the auctioneer , whose sing-song tally of the price was only understood by those who needed to know .
" prices are depressed but not as depressed as we feared , " said sheep and arable farmer russell toothill , the national farmers ' union chairman for south and west yorkshire .
" the selling season 's been compressed into a few weeks .
farmers are running out of feed and running out of money . "
for many people , it 's good to get out and have a coffee and a pie in the livestock market cafe with other farmers .
the hills can be lonely places .
one farmers told me of someone who came with their animals to market three days after the foot-and-mouth outbreak and the immediate imposition of a total livestock movement ban .

the next couple of weeks are , traditionally , some of the busiest the skipton countryside is stunning .
craggy green hills , cloaked in hazy mist on an otherwise clear , golden , autumn day in yorkshire .
the sheep in the fields , to an outsider , look like attractive additions but to the farmers , they are the visible signs of impending ruin .
it 's believed the word skipton is derived from the anglo-saxon word for sheep - which gives a good idea of how important the animals have been for the town 's prosperity .
they once brought wealth and prestige .
but now , most farmers find it hard to make a living from livestock .
with the restrictions imposed as a result of foot-and-mouth , they say that has now become nigh on impossible .

britain is now divided into " risk " and " low risk " areas , in terms of foot-and-mouth , as well as a protection zone around previously-infected farms in surrey .
the foot-and-mouth low risk area includes all of england , scotland and wales , apart from south-east england and the home counties .
sing-song tally although quiet , the first day of the sales in skipton did have a buzz about them if only because they 're the first such sales in several weeks .
the selling season 's been compressed into a few weeks .
farmers are running out of feed and running out of money farmer russell toothill farmers , their faces lined from years of hard work outdoors , leant along the rails of the livestock ring , flat caps in hand or on head , making bids in a way so imperceptible they were only obvious to the auctioneer , whose sing-song tally of the price was only understood by those who needed to know .

the next couple of weeks are , traditionally , some of the busiest the skipton countryside is stunning .
craggy green hills , cloaked in hazy mist on an otherwise clear , golden , autumn day in yorkshire .
the sheep in the fields , to an outsider , look like attractive additions but to the farmers , they are the visible signs of impending ruin .
it 's believed the word skipton is derived from the anglo-saxon word for sheep - which gives a good idea of how important the animals have been for the town 's prosperity .
they once brought wealth and prestige .
but now , most farmers find it hard to make a living from livestock .
with the restrictions imposed as a result of foot-and-mouth , they say that has now become nigh on impossible .
restriction worries the outbreak could not have come at a worse time for british livestock farmers .

they sell on " store lambs " to other buyers who will keep them - as well as breeding ewes - until they themselves sell them on in february or march .
government vets are doing what they can to make sure that the restrictions do not destroy the very thing they are trying to save .
britain is now divided into " risk " and " low risk " areas , in terms of foot-and-mouth , as well as a protection zone around previously-infected farms in surrey .
the foot-and-mouth low risk area includes all of england , scotland and wales , apart from south-east england and the home counties .
sing-song tally although quiet , the first day of the sales in skipton did have a buzz about them if only because they 're the first such sales in several weeks .
the selling season 's been compressed into a few weeks .
farmers are running out of feed and running out of money farmer russell toothill farmers , their faces lined from years of hard work outdoors , leant along the rails of the livestock ring , flat caps in hand or on head , making bids in a way so imperceptible they were only obvious to the auctioneer , whose sing-song tally of the price was only understood by those who needed to know .
" prices are depressed but not as depressed as we feared , " said sheep and arable farmer russell toothill , the national farmers ' union chairman for south and west yorkshire .
" the selling season 's been compressed into a few weeks .
farmers are running out of feed and running out of money . "
for many people , it 's good to get out and have a coffee and a pie in the livestock market cafe with other farmers .

he said the 50 % of windfall oil profits stipulated in a law passed last year was not enough , and the state should now receive 99 % .
it is one of the radical reforms promised by mr correa to spread ecuador 's wealth to the country 's poor .
but the size and timing of this latest move took many by surprise .
it will worry foreign investors and oil companies which operate in ecuador .
windfall profits are made whenever prices on international oil markets exceed prices established in existing contracts .
venezuelan model ?
the foreign oil companies complained in 2006 when it was agreed that all such profits should be split 50-50 with the state .
but now mr correa says the state is not getting enough and will now take 99 % .
his decree said revenues should be distributed in a more just way .
critics have accused the ecuadorean government of copying radical measures introduced in venezuela by president hugo chavez .
but ecuador 's oil minister , galo chiriboga , said the government was not nationalising anything .
among the foreign companies operating in ecuador are brazil 's petrobras , perenco of france and the spanish-argentine company repsol ypf .
they help to produce more than 500,000 barrels of crude oil a day - a major contribution to ecuador 's economy .

he said the 50 % of windfall oil profits stipulated in a law passed last year was not enough , and the state should now receive 99 % .
it is one of the radical reforms promised by mr correa to spread ecuador 's wealth to the country 's poor .
but the size and timing of this latest move took many by surprise .
it will worry foreign investors and oil companies which operate in ecuador .
windfall profits are made whenever prices on international oil markets exceed prices established in existing contracts .
venezuelan model ?
the foreign oil companies complained in 2006 when it was agreed that all such profits should be split 50-50 with the state .
but now mr correa says the state is not getting enough and will now take 99 % .
his decree said revenues should be distributed in a more just way .
critics have accused the ecuadorean government of copying radical measures introduced in venezuela by president hugo chavez .
but ecuador 's oil minister , galo chiriboga , said the government was not nationalising anything .
among the foreign companies operating in ecuador are brazil 's petrobras , perenco of france and the spanish-argentine company repsol ypf .
they help to produce more than 500,000 barrels of crude oil a day - a major contribution to ecuador 's economy .
