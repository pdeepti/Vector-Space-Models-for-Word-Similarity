20 , joining a week-long stoppage by rail workers . the nationwide protests , which are over issues ranging from pension reform to the cost of living , had disrupted hospitals , schools , trains , postal services and airports .
they are seen as the biggest threat to sarkozy 's planned reforms since he was elected president in may .
according to a new csa survey , sarkozy 's approval rating has fallen five points this month alone , to 51 percent .
asked if the transport strike , now in its eight day , could hurt the economy , public accounts minister eric woerth said on tuesday : " not over several days .
but if it lasted longer , it could obviously have consequences . "
" when you decide not to work , when you prevent goods from circulating in a certain way , when you prevent people from getting to places , obviously that can be a problem at some point , " woerth told france inter radio .

they voted to continue the strike they began on nov .
13 so that it overlapped with tuesday 's one-day walk out by civil servants .
opinion polls show the rail strike is unpopular with most french voters , but a majority sympathizes with the civil servants ' strike .
one-day civil servant walk-out the striking public-sector workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to cut 23,000 jobs in 2008 - half of them in education - by not replacing retiring civil servants .
some 58 percent of high-school teachers were participating in tuesday 's walk-out in paris , a union official said .
unions representing 5.2 million state employees - around a quarter of the entire workforce - also said their spending power had fallen by six percent since 2000 and were demanding pay rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air transport is also distrupted france 's postal service , la poste , said about 15 percent of its mailmen and women were on strike , while meteorologists , bank workers and hospital staff were also among those downing tools .
international flights were cancelled and delayed as air traffic control staff at some airports went on strike .
paris ' two airports reported average flight delays of around 40 minutes , and services at marseille airport , in the country 's south , have also been affected .
tuesday 's walkout is the third nationwide civil servants ' strike this year .
the 24-hour strike coincided with student protests , which disrupted classes in half of the country 's 85 universities in a campaign against a law giving faculties the right to raise money from private companies .
the french also awoke to find their newsstands empty of papers as distributors began a one-day strike over planned restructuring that is expected to lead to job losses .
striking energy workers cut 5,500 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- , or about 8.7 percent of production capacity , at edf nuclear plants earlier in the morning , the leading energy union said .
public transport in disarray state rail operator sncf has said the number of people involved in the rail strike , which affected national trains as well as paris subway and bus services , had fallen since it began last tuesday , but public transport continued to be disrupted .
bildunterschrift : the rail strike is becoming increasingly unpopular as many commuters changed from trains to cars , traffic jams stretched over more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- across france on tuesday morning .
sncf said about half its high-speed tgv trains would run on tuesday and the eurostar link with london would run normally .
talks with rail unions were due to start on wednesday .
the government has dropped its demand that the strike end before the talks get underway and instead said there simply should be a " back-to-work dynamic . "
the walk-out was over plans to increase contribution periods for the 500,000 workers - mainly in the rail and energy sectors - who enjoy " special " pension systems and can retire on full pensions as early as age 50 .
and more strikes are expected : tobacconists are due to shut up shop on wednesday to protest against new anti-smoking laws , and french judges and lawyers have planned a strike on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 20.11.2007 vodafone obtains restraining order on telekom 's iphone sales großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exclusive to t-mobile : the iphone is sold in germany on condition that it uses one network vodafone announced monday , nov .
19 , that it had obtained a restraining order against deutsche telekom prohibiting the telecommunications giant from selling apple 's iphone in germany without a mandatory calling plan . the stylish touchscreen phone and music player went on sale this month in germany with telekom as its exclusive vendor .
deutsche telekom requires buyers to sign up to a two-year contract with its t-mobile wireless network .
the german unit of vodafone took its grievance over the iphone 's exclusive use in t-mobile 's network and the use of the device being limited to certain fees within t-mobile 's subscription offerings to a regional court in hamburg .
the court then issued the restraining order on sales which will apply until a substantive argument is brought before a court .
temporary injunctions such as the one issued against telekom can be overturned on appeal .
t-mobile confirmed the restraining order has been issued , adding that the company was examining the issue .
vodafone aim not to stop sales completely vodafone germany chief executive friedrich joussen said that vodafone was n't generally opposed to t-mobile 's exclusivity contract with apple , adding that the company did not want to halt iphone sales but wanted to have these new sales practices examined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodafone will fight the iphone in germany with the qbowl " we want it to be available to buyers without a mandatory calling plan , " he said .
" if i had wanted to halt sales , i could have , but i did n't . "
joussen said he expected a substantive ruling within two weeks .
vodafone will launch its own multifunctional handheld-computer phone , the qbowl , before christmas as a direct competitor to telekom 's iphone monopoly .
apple has stipulated that in germany , as in the united states , the iphone should be placed in the hands of the leading mobile phone operator on condition the phones are dedicated to one network and that apple gets a cut of revenues .
the iphone contains a lock which prevents it from being used on any other network .
telekom sales practice could change industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french iphone is open to other networks by law while vodafone stated it was pursuing legal action only in germany as it felt specific national rules on access to networks were being broken , the company is actually concerned that other handset makers , such as nokia or ericsson , could adopt similar strategies .

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .
" but it 's the only way .
and the parents have to apply pressure from below . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .

the european union as a whole is on track to meet its kyoto targets , but only by making use of mechanisms such as emissions trading , according to the report .
britain , france , germany and sweden are the only pre-enlargement eu-15 countries expected to meet the 2012 goal without implementing additional measures .

industrial countries ' emissions surging however , the total greenhouse gas emissions from the world 's industrialized nations has been growing since 2000 , reaching a near-record in 2005 and continuing to move upward .
reductions between 1990 and 2000 lead to an overall reduction for some kyoto signers , despite the upward swing that followed .
" greenhouse-gas emissions between 1990 and 2000 went down , but then between 2000 and 2005 they increased again , by 2.6 percent , " unfccc executive secretary yvo de boer said tuesday at a press conference held in bonn , germany 's former capital .
the unfccc blamed continued growth in western economies and a revival of growth in former east bloc nations , with pollution from transport being the biggest culprit in any sector .

" emissions trends around the world and especially in industrialized countries are worrying , " de boer said .

representatives from more than 180 countries , together with researchers and observers , will attend the conference .
de boer set a triple benchmark to judge bali 's success .
" if there is a decision to launch negotiations , if an agenda for negotiations is agreed and if an end-date -lrb- for completing negotiations -rrb- is set , then i would consider bali to be a success , " he said .

some thought it was about time the majority muslim serbian province was set free , others thought independence would cause further instability in the balkans . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as history teaches us , european policy has caused many injuries over the centuries to small nations - for example , to albania after leaving half of that nation outside its own territory in 1913 .
the worst is that of slavic regimes , who have used a brutal way of governing minorities over the centuries by killing millions of innocent people .
this must not happen anymore and the kosovo case should be a lesson to dictators -lsb- such -rsb- as milosevic and his friends , but also to other politicians .
kosovo will be the world 's newest state . - edmond , albania i traveled through this area in 1954 and stayed in pristina for four days .
the muslims were murdering even then any christian they could catch alone .
they referred to themselves as turks .
i presume they are the leftovers of the ottoman empire .
kosovo must remain a part of serbia .
the usa was and is conducting the wrong diplomacy .
i believe it is influenced by the need for oil from saudi arabia .
europe does not need another islamic government . - alexius lessig , us kosovo belongs to serbia and the russian republic wo n't let the serbian province declare independence . - arthur cardoso da costa junior , brazil giving independence to what is essentially the heart of serbia is like giving a big chunk of berlin to turks or malmo to north africans or bradford to pakistanis or marseilles to the arabs .
i am sure it wo n't happen .
the serbs will not allow it to happen and europeans , as different from their supine , corrupt politicians , also do not want it . - marco borg , uk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would indepence lead to another war in the balkans ?
while they have high profile criminals in their government nothing will help people of kosovo .
it is very funny to me that europe supports these kosovo leaders .
the only outcome will be another war in the balkan region and it is only a matter of time before you will have another disasterous war in front of your " democratic " europe . - sasha malkovitch , australia may the people of kosovo enjoy independence , they have been waiting for more than 2,000 years . - adam , albania compiled by dw staff -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

frank , a jewish girl who hid from the nazis for more than two years , mentioned the tree several times in her famous diary . after visiting the chestnut tree , the judge at the amsterdam administrative court decided on tuesday , nov .

this was in response to a case brought by several groups who are against the felling of the so-called anne frank tree .
however , the judge still has the possibility to change his decision .
the 27-ton chestnut tree stands in a private garden overlooked by the achterhuis annex where the frank family hid during world war two . back on march 6 , the city of amsterdam granted the property owner permission to fell the tree in the interest of public safely .
tests undertaken by the city reveal that the chestnut , which is estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old , is diseased and several attempts to revive it have failed .

the anne frank foundation , which maintains the achterhuis as a museum about anne frank and the persecution of the jews , has adopted a neutral stance .
a spokesman for the foundation said that although it regrets that the tree has to be cut down , it understands that public safety comes first .
however , the dutch tree foundation and several neighbors who are opposed to felling the chestnut are appealing the decision .

20 by the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- has projected that by 2012 , the industrial nations that signed and ratified the kyoto convention are on track to emit 10.8 percent less greenhouse gasses than they did in 1990 .
the european union as a whole is on track to meet its kyoto targets , but only by making use of mechanisms such as emissions trading , according to the report .
britain , france , germany and sweden are the only pre-enlargement eu-15 countries expected to meet the 2012 goal without implementing additional measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and australia are the two industrialized nations refusing to ratify kyoto the kyoto protocol commits 36 industrialized countries to a five percent reduction target from 2008 to 2012 compared to 1990 .
industrial countries ' emissions surging however , the total greenhouse gas emissions from the world 's industrialized nations has been growing since 2000 , reaching a near-record in 2005 and continuing to move upward .
reductions between 1990 and 2000 lead to an overall reduction for some kyoto signers , despite the upward swing that followed .
" greenhouse-gas emissions between 1990 and 2000 went down , but then between 2000 and 2005 they increased again , by 2.6 percent , " unfccc executive secretary yvo de boer said tuesday at a press conference held in bonn , germany 's former capital .
the unfccc blamed continued growth in western economies and a revival of growth in former east bloc nations , with pollution from transport being the biggest culprit in any sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is already wreacking havoc with entire ecosystems the united states , which is the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gases but has refused to sign the kyoto agreement , emitted 16.3 percent more greenhouse gases in 2005 than in 1990 , the report noted .
" emissions trends around the world and especially in industrialized countries are worrying , " de boer said .
kyoto to be discussed on bali the unfccc presented its emissions data findings two weeks ahead of a united nations climate conference on bali , indonesia , at which negotiations on a post-kyoto deal are expected to be launched .
representatives from more than 180 countries , together with researchers and observers , will attend the conference .
de boer set a triple benchmark to judge bali 's success .
" if there is a decision to launch negotiations , if an agenda for negotiations is agreed and if an end-date -lrb- for completing negotiations -rrb- is set , then i would consider bali to be a success , " he said .
" anything less than that would be either short of success or a failure . " dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , joining a week-long stoppage by rail workers . the nationwide protests , which are over issues ranging from pension reform to the cost of living , had disrupted hospitals , schools , trains , postal services and airports .
they are seen as the biggest threat to sarkozy 's planned reforms since he was elected president in may .
according to a new csa survey , sarkozy 's approval rating has fallen five points this month alone , to 51 percent .
asked if the transport strike , now in its eight day , could hurt the economy , public accounts minister eric woerth said on tuesday : " not over several days .
but if it lasted longer , it could obviously have consequences . "
" when you decide not to work , when you prevent goods from circulating in a certain way , when you prevent people from getting to places , obviously that can be a problem at some point , " woerth told france inter radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes are a test for sarkozy the rail workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to scrap some public sector pension rights .
they voted to continue the strike they began on nov .
13 so that it overlapped with tuesday 's one-day walk out by civil servants .
opinion polls show the rail strike is unpopular with most french voters , but a majority sympathizes with the civil servants ' strike .
one-day civil servant walk-out the striking public-sector workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to cut 23,000 jobs in 2008 - half of them in education - by not replacing retiring civil servants .
some 58 percent of high-school teachers were participating in tuesday 's walk-out in paris , a union official said .
unions representing 5.2 million state employees - around a quarter of the entire workforce - also said their spending power had fallen by six percent since 2000 and were demanding pay rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air transport is also distrupted france 's postal service , la poste , said about 15 percent of its mailmen and women were on strike , while meteorologists , bank workers and hospital staff were also among those downing tools .
international flights were cancelled and delayed as air traffic control staff at some airports went on strike .
paris ' two airports reported average flight delays of around 40 minutes , and services at marseille airport , in the country 's south , have also been affected .
tuesday 's walkout is the third nationwide civil servants ' strike this year .
the 24-hour strike coincided with student protests , which disrupted classes in half of the country 's 85 universities in a campaign against a law giving faculties the right to raise money from private companies .
the french also awoke to find their newsstands empty of papers as distributors began a one-day strike over planned restructuring that is expected to lead to job losses .
striking energy workers cut 5,500 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- , or about 8.7 percent of production capacity , at edf nuclear plants earlier in the morning , the leading energy union said .
public transport in disarray state rail operator sncf has said the number of people involved in the rail strike , which affected national trains as well as paris subway and bus services , had fallen since it began last tuesday , but public transport continued to be disrupted .
bildunterschrift : the rail strike is becoming increasingly unpopular as many commuters changed from trains to cars , traffic jams stretched over more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- across france on tuesday morning .

asked if the transport strike , now in its eight day , could hurt the economy , public accounts minister eric woerth said on tuesday : " not over several days .
but if it lasted longer , it could obviously have consequences . "

20 by the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- has projected that by 2012 , the industrial nations that signed and ratified the kyoto convention are on track to emit 10.8 percent less greenhouse gasses than they did in 1990 .
the european union as a whole is on track to meet its kyoto targets , but only by making use of mechanisms such as emissions trading , according to the report .
britain , france , germany and sweden are the only pre-enlargement eu-15 countries expected to meet the 2012 goal without implementing additional measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and australia are the two industrialized nations refusing to ratify kyoto the kyoto protocol commits 36 industrialized countries to a five percent reduction target from 2008 to 2012 compared to 1990 .
industrial countries ' emissions surging however , the total greenhouse gas emissions from the world 's industrialized nations has been growing since 2000 , reaching a near-record in 2005 and continuing to move upward .
reductions between 1990 and 2000 lead to an overall reduction for some kyoto signers , despite the upward swing that followed .
" greenhouse-gas emissions between 1990 and 2000 went down , but then between 2000 and 2005 they increased again , by 2.6 percent , " unfccc executive secretary yvo de boer said tuesday at a press conference held in bonn , germany 's former capital .
the unfccc blamed continued growth in western economies and a revival of growth in former east bloc nations , with pollution from transport being the biggest culprit in any sector .

" emissions trends around the world and especially in industrialized countries are worrying , " de boer said .
kyoto to be discussed on bali the unfccc presented its emissions data findings two weeks ahead of a united nations climate conference on bali , indonesia , at which negotiations on a post-kyoto deal are expected to be launched .
representatives from more than 180 countries , together with researchers and observers , will attend the conference .
de boer set a triple benchmark to judge bali 's success .
" if there is a decision to launch negotiations , if an agenda for negotiations is agreed and if an end-date -lrb- for completing negotiations -rrb- is set , then i would consider bali to be a success , " he said .

frank , a jewish girl who hid from the nazis for more than two years , mentioned the tree several times in her famous diary . after visiting the chestnut tree , the judge at the amsterdam administrative court decided on tuesday , nov .
20 to temporarily rescind permission to cut it down .
this was in response to a case brought by several groups who are against the felling of the so-called anne frank tree .
however , the judge still has the possibility to change his decision .
the 27-ton chestnut tree stands in a private garden overlooked by the achterhuis annex where the frank family hid during world war two . back on march 6 , the city of amsterdam granted the property owner permission to fell the tree in the interest of public safely .
tests undertaken by the city reveal that the chestnut , which is estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old , is diseased and several attempts to revive it have failed .
the tree 's owner wants it destroyed because under dutch law he is liable for any damage caused if it falls .
amsterdam authorities had planned to plant a tree genetically identical to the diseased chestnut in its place .
tree symbol of life outside of hiding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frank family 's hiding place is now a museum anne frank wrote in her diary on february 23 , 1944 : " we both looked up to the blue sky , the horse chestnut whose bare branches glittered with droplets , the gulls and the other birds that seemed made of silver as they swooped by .
" all of this moved us so much that we could not speak . "
the anne frank foundation , which maintains the achterhuis as a museum about anne frank and the persecution of the jews , has adopted a neutral stance .
a spokesman for the foundation said that although it regrets that the tree has to be cut down , it understands that public safety comes first .
however , the dutch tree foundation and several neighbors who are opposed to felling the chestnut are appealing the decision .
they contest the authorities ' claim that 72 percent of the tree is diseased , and therefore could blow over at any time , saying that their own tests show the tree could be rescued .
a so-called administration court , which settles conflicts between citizens and administrative authorities , is to hear both sides prior to the planned felling .
death in a concentration camp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank died at the age of fifteen in bergen belsen a total of eight jews hid in the achterhuis between 1942 and 1944 until they were betrayed in august 1944 .
the germans subsequently deported them to concentration camps , where some were killed and others succumbed following starvation and illness .
anne frank , along with her sister margot , died of typhus in bergen belsen concentration camp , in the north of germany .
otto frank , anne frank 's father , was the only survivor .
after the war , miep gies , who provided the group with basic necessities while in hiding , gave him the diary his youngest daughter anne had written during that period .
following its publication in 1947 , the diary of anne frank became one of the most famous documents recounting the nazi persecution of the jews during world war two . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , joining a week-long stoppage by rail workers . the nationwide protests , which are over issues ranging from pension reform to the cost of living , had disrupted hospitals , schools , trains , postal services and airports .
they are seen as the biggest threat to sarkozy 's planned reforms since he was elected president in may .
according to a new csa survey , sarkozy 's approval rating has fallen five points this month alone , to 51 percent .
asked if the transport strike , now in its eight day , could hurt the economy , public accounts minister eric woerth said on tuesday : " not over several days .
but if it lasted longer , it could obviously have consequences . "
" when you decide not to work , when you prevent goods from circulating in a certain way , when you prevent people from getting to places , obviously that can be a problem at some point , " woerth told france inter radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes are a test for sarkozy the rail workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to scrap some public sector pension rights .
they voted to continue the strike they began on nov .
13 so that it overlapped with tuesday 's one-day walk out by civil servants .
opinion polls show the rail strike is unpopular with most french voters , but a majority sympathizes with the civil servants ' strike .
one-day civil servant walk-out the striking public-sector workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to cut 23,000 jobs in 2008 - half of them in education - by not replacing retiring civil servants .
some 58 percent of high-school teachers were participating in tuesday 's walk-out in paris , a union official said .
unions representing 5.2 million state employees - around a quarter of the entire workforce - also said their spending power had fallen by six percent since 2000 and were demanding pay rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air transport is also distrupted france 's postal service , la poste , said about 15 percent of its mailmen and women were on strike , while meteorologists , bank workers and hospital staff were also among those downing tools .
international flights were cancelled and delayed as air traffic control staff at some airports went on strike .
paris ' two airports reported average flight delays of around 40 minutes , and services at marseille airport , in the country 's south , have also been affected .
tuesday 's walkout is the third nationwide civil servants ' strike this year .
the 24-hour strike coincided with student protests , which disrupted classes in half of the country 's 85 universities in a campaign against a law giving faculties the right to raise money from private companies .
the french also awoke to find their newsstands empty of papers as distributors began a one-day strike over planned restructuring that is expected to lead to job losses .
striking energy workers cut 5,500 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- , or about 8.7 percent of production capacity , at edf nuclear plants earlier in the morning , the leading energy union said .
public transport in disarray state rail operator sncf has said the number of people involved in the rail strike , which affected national trains as well as paris subway and bus services , had fallen since it began last tuesday , but public transport continued to be disrupted .
bildunterschrift : the rail strike is becoming increasingly unpopular as many commuters changed from trains to cars , traffic jams stretched over more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- across france on tuesday morning .
sncf said about half its high-speed tgv trains would run on tuesday and the eurostar link with london would run normally .
talks with rail unions were due to start on wednesday .
the government has dropped its demand that the strike end before the talks get underway and instead said there simply should be a " back-to-work dynamic . "
the walk-out was over plans to increase contribution periods for the 500,000 workers - mainly in the rail and energy sectors - who enjoy " special " pension systems and can retire on full pensions as early as age 50 .
and more strikes are expected : tobacconists are due to shut up shop on wednesday to protest against new anti-smoking laws , and french judges and lawyers have planned a strike on nov .

the site dedicated to showing people 's self-made films has a breakthrough act in munich singer mina . the 14-year old has become a huge hit , not only on the video platform but also in the music charts , thanks to one clip of her singing .
now , she has an apartment in her name , a recording contract and a hit single , " how the angels fly . " the clip of mina singing attracted three million visitors and the attentions of the starwatch label which searches and promotes new talent in cooperation with german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the youngster 's music career is now well and truly off the launch pad , with no little help from magic internet , the company which runs myvideo . but the video hosting site is not looking for gratitude or royalty payments .
the fact that germany 's latest starlet sprang from the berlin-based company 's portal is thanks enough .
a talented and pretty new star is a great advert for a small firm of 20 staff which has now been catapulted into germany 's internet elite by capitalizing on the wide-reaching possibilities of web 2.0 . ideal platform for those seeking fleeting fame the basis for myvideo 's success since it was launched in march 2006 is simple .
people want to be famous .
it seems that andy warhol 's assertion that everyone will be famous for 15 minutes does n't rate highly with the new generation of self-publicists .
five minutes will do .
and myvideo provides the ideal platform for this fleeting flirtation with fame . " the users want to present themselves , they want the chance to become famous for five minutes " , christian vollmann , manager of magic internet said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube leads the sector but myvideo has big plans it does n't seem to matter what they do to become famous either .
videos of cleaning mishaps , crazy pets , teen-angst monologues and wannabes singing in their bedrooms all share space on the portal .
more than half of those who appear are under 30 years old . it is , however , a fiercely competitive sector .
myvideo 's attraction is that it is a young and hip portal .
while this makes it popular with a certain demographic , it also leads to a creative chaos which the sector leader , youtube , keeps under control and which german challengers like clipfish and sevenload try to avoid . mina inspires myvideo to plan expansion however , if the internet free-for-all results in a mina every 18 months , myvideo would gladly accept it .
since the youngster exploded on the scene , she has retold her story of how myvideo launched her on the world in every interview she has given .
people in the entertainment business know that you ca n't put a price on publicity like that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another mina could be hiding out there myvideo now has other plans for expansion of its name and services .
the site recently hosted the video for the new single from popular german band die fantastischen vier and has signed a cooperation deal with sony bmg to host videos from its artists . there are also plans in the pipeline to expand into other european countries , with scandinavia , the benelux countries and eastern europe the targets .
perhaps , with an extended range , myvideo can provide another mina , currently singing into her hairbrush in a romanian bedroom perhaps , with the chance to be a star . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

think again . the conflict began with a recent suggestion by national team representatives to hold a round-table discussion to talk about the poor showing by bundesliga sides in this year 's champions league and uefa cup competitions .
one of the issues to be discussed was a perceived lack of coherent soccer philosophy among german clubs . that raised the hackles of many club coaches and managers , and völler , who 's now commercial manager at leverkusen , took out his ire on bierhoff - a former german international . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff , left , has always been more of a politician " i would suggest oliver bierhoff show a bit more humility , " said völler in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker .
" with players who 've been trained at clubs like cologne , bayern munich , stuttgart , bremen and bayer leverkusen , you can put a philosophy into practice .
but a philosophy for a player like oliver bierhoff has yet to be invented .
you ca n't demand brazilian style if you yourself have feet from malta . " below the belt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : völler was germany 's national coach from 2000 to 2004 völler , rarely one to shy away from a good rant , continued to lambaste the germany manager . " in the next few days , oliver bierhoff should consult dr. müller-wohlfahrt -lsb- germany 's national team physician -rsb- , " völler said .
" he probably has some painful internal injuries resulting from permanently patting himself on the back . " there 's been no love lost between the suave bierhoff and the salt-of-the-earth völler since early 2002 , when then-national-coach völler stripped then-player bierhoff of his position as team captain .
bierhoff became germany 's manager in 2004 , when jürgen klinsmann took over as coach from völler . bierhoff has been quick to fire some salvos of his own .
" personally , it amazes me the way things go below the belt , if someone does n't have any arguments , " bierhoff shot back in a statement .
" this is the sort of criticism that comes out over a few beers at the pub .
i have to accept that fact , but it 's beneath my dignity . " media glee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff scored the winning goal for germany in the 1996 european championships final but the former top striker was clearly irritated by the jibe about him having feet from malta . " that 's absolute nonsense , " bierhoff huffed .
" i won the italian league with ac milan , was italy 's top goal scorer one year and am one of few players to have scored more than 100 goals . " bierhoff also scored 37 goals in 70 appearances for germany - 10 fewer than völler . the völler-bierhoff feud has completely overshadowed germany 's last euro 2008 qualifying match against wales on wednesday , nov .
21 , which is largely meaningless .
newspapers around the country have gleefully reprinted the insults and counter-insults , pouring further oil on the fiery relationship between the two former german soccer greats . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 20.11.2007 berlin butchers join forces to protect the " home " of currywurst großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin butchers believe the currywurst was born in the capital and want the eu to agree wherever you go in germany , you can get a currywurst .
it tastes the same all over but comes with different frills depending on the region .
however , some believe it should be officially recognized as a berlin speciality . those interfering europeans are at it again .
less than two weeks ago , a major diplomatic incident was avoided when the european union allowed the german specialty apfelwein to continue being known as a wine .
it was a close call .
if the eu had pushed through with its idea to bless only those drinks made from grapes with the term , the forces of the state of hessen would have risen up and gotten really , really angry .
luckily , for everyone involved and the wider world in general , the eurocrats and the overly-protective germans called off hostilities and avoided a potentially deadly exchange of handbags .
now , however , it seems as though the eu is set on provoking further german ire by targeting the sacred currywurst .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " konnopkes imbiss " : berlin 's most famous wurst stand as a german-wide culinary phenomenon , the eu believes that the delicacy - a fried pork sausage cut into slices drowned in ketchup , curry and tomato concentrate - can be made , cooked and sold under the term anywhere in the country .
berlin butchers want to claim capital as currywurst 's home a group of berlin butchers have another idea and have joined together to patent the currywurst sausage .
the butchers ' objective is to " geographically " protect their culinary invention , the 1949 creation of one herta heuwer , a berliner who served her snack day and night in the western part of the then divided city .
they want the spot of her famous food stall , which was an institution at the time , to be officially recognized as the home of the currywurst .
the potential spat is still at the diplomatic level and has not yet reached the bellicose rhetoric of the apfelwein rebellion of early november .
the sausage separatists have so far followed the protocol laid down by the un savory snack council and have filed a patent request with the european patent office .
even if the currywurst crisis is averted on a pan-european level , there are still fears that a civil sausage war could break out between states and regions in germany .
north could make a claim against berlin patent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern german states may contest berlin 's claim northern german states and cities would be those most likely to take offense to the berlin claim should the patent be agreed .
the currywurst enjoys cult status in many areas and some believe its birthplace to be further north than the capital .
the tension is unlikely to abate any time soon .
the patent application procedure lasts between two and three years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de no sap spilt as peace breaks out in apfelwein war people go to war over many things ; religion , land , resources .
many times , the reason is long forgotten in the horror which follows .
luckily , no one will have to face the shame of one breaking out over apple wine .

" greenhouse-gas emissions between 1990 and 2000 went down , but then between 2000 and 2005 they increased again , by 2.6 percent , " unfccc executive secretary yvo de boer said tuesday at a press conference held in bonn , germany 's former capital .
the unfccc blamed continued growth in western economies and a revival of growth in former east bloc nations , with pollution from transport being the biggest culprit in any sector .

representatives from more than 180 countries , together with researchers and observers , will attend the conference .
de boer set a triple benchmark to judge bali 's success .
" if there is a decision to launch negotiations , if an agenda for negotiations is agreed and if an end-date -lrb- for completing negotiations -rrb- is set , then i would consider bali to be a success , " he said .

the site dedicated to showing people 's self-made films has a breakthrough act in munich singer mina . the 14-year old has become a huge hit , not only on the video platform but also in the music charts , thanks to one clip of her singing .
now , she has an apartment in her name , a recording contract and a hit single , " how the angels fly . " the clip of mina singing attracted three million visitors and the attentions of the starwatch label which searches and promotes new talent in cooperation with german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the youngster 's music career is now well and truly off the launch pad , with no little help from magic internet , the company which runs myvideo . but the video hosting site is not looking for gratitude or royalty payments .

myvideo 's attraction is that it is a young and hip portal .
while this makes it popular with a certain demographic , it also leads to a creative chaos which the sector leader , youtube , keeps under control and which german challengers like clipfish and sevenload try to avoid . mina inspires myvideo to plan expansion however , if the internet free-for-all results in a mina every 18 months , myvideo would gladly accept it .

think again . the conflict began with a recent suggestion by national team representatives to hold a round-table discussion to talk about the poor showing by bundesliga sides in this year 's champions league and uefa cup competitions .
one of the issues to be discussed was a perceived lack of coherent soccer philosophy among german clubs . that raised the hackles of many club coaches and managers , and völler , who 's now commercial manager at leverkusen , took out his ire on bierhoff - a former german international . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff , left , has always been more of a politician " i would suggest oliver bierhoff show a bit more humility , " said völler in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker .
" with players who 've been trained at clubs like cologne , bayern munich , stuttgart , bremen and bayer leverkusen , you can put a philosophy into practice .
but a philosophy for a player like oliver bierhoff has yet to be invented .
you ca n't demand brazilian style if you yourself have feet from malta . " below the belt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : völler was germany 's national coach from 2000 to 2004 völler , rarely one to shy away from a good rant , continued to lambaste the germany manager . " in the next few days , oliver bierhoff should consult dr. müller-wohlfahrt -lsb- germany 's national team physician -rsb- , " völler said .
" he probably has some painful internal injuries resulting from permanently patting himself on the back . " there 's been no love lost between the suave bierhoff and the salt-of-the-earth völler since early 2002 , when then-national-coach völler stripped then-player bierhoff of his position as team captain .
bierhoff became germany 's manager in 2004 , when jürgen klinsmann took over as coach from völler . bierhoff has been quick to fire some salvos of his own .
" personally , it amazes me the way things go below the belt , if someone does n't have any arguments , " bierhoff shot back in a statement .
" this is the sort of criticism that comes out over a few beers at the pub .
i have to accept that fact , but it 's beneath my dignity . " media glee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff scored the winning goal for germany in the 1996 european championships final but the former top striker was clearly irritated by the jibe about him having feet from malta . " that 's absolute nonsense , " bierhoff huffed .
" i won the italian league with ac milan , was italy 's top goal scorer one year and am one of few players to have scored more than 100 goals . " bierhoff also scored 37 goals in 70 appearances for germany - 10 fewer than völler . the völler-bierhoff feud has completely overshadowed germany 's last euro 2008 qualifying match against wales on wednesday , nov .
21 , which is largely meaningless .
newspapers around the country have gleefully reprinted the insults and counter-insults , pouring further oil on the fiery relationship between the two former german soccer greats . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .
" but it 's the only way .
and the parents have to apply pressure from below . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the site dedicated to showing people 's self-made films has a breakthrough act in munich singer mina . the 14-year old has become a huge hit , not only on the video platform but also in the music charts , thanks to one clip of her singing .
now , she has an apartment in her name , a recording contract and a hit single , " how the angels fly . " the clip of mina singing attracted three million visitors and the attentions of the starwatch label which searches and promotes new talent in cooperation with german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the youngster 's music career is now well and truly off the launch pad , with no little help from magic internet , the company which runs myvideo . but the video hosting site is not looking for gratitude or royalty payments .
the fact that germany 's latest starlet sprang from the berlin-based company 's portal is thanks enough .
a talented and pretty new star is a great advert for a small firm of 20 staff which has now been catapulted into germany 's internet elite by capitalizing on the wide-reaching possibilities of web 2.0 . ideal platform for those seeking fleeting fame the basis for myvideo 's success since it was launched in march 2006 is simple .
people want to be famous .
it seems that andy warhol 's assertion that everyone will be famous for 15 minutes does n't rate highly with the new generation of self-publicists .
five minutes will do .
and myvideo provides the ideal platform for this fleeting flirtation with fame . " the users want to present themselves , they want the chance to become famous for five minutes " , christian vollmann , manager of magic internet said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube leads the sector but myvideo has big plans it does n't seem to matter what they do to become famous either .
videos of cleaning mishaps , crazy pets , teen-angst monologues and wannabes singing in their bedrooms all share space on the portal .
more than half of those who appear are under 30 years old . it is , however , a fiercely competitive sector .
myvideo 's attraction is that it is a young and hip portal .
while this makes it popular with a certain demographic , it also leads to a creative chaos which the sector leader , youtube , keeps under control and which german challengers like clipfish and sevenload try to avoid . mina inspires myvideo to plan expansion however , if the internet free-for-all results in a mina every 18 months , myvideo would gladly accept it .
since the youngster exploded on the scene , she has retold her story of how myvideo launched her on the world in every interview she has given .
people in the entertainment business know that you ca n't put a price on publicity like that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another mina could be hiding out there myvideo now has other plans for expansion of its name and services .
the site recently hosted the video for the new single from popular german band die fantastischen vier and has signed a cooperation deal with sony bmg to host videos from its artists . there are also plans in the pipeline to expand into other european countries , with scandinavia , the benelux countries and eastern europe the targets .
perhaps , with an extended range , myvideo can provide another mina , currently singing into her hairbrush in a romanian bedroom perhaps , with the chance to be a star . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .
" but it 's the only way .
and the parents have to apply pressure from below . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

frank , a jewish girl who hid from the nazis for more than two years , mentioned the tree several times in her famous diary . after visiting the chestnut tree , the judge at the amsterdam administrative court decided on tuesday , nov .
20 to temporarily rescind permission to cut it down .
this was in response to a case brought by several groups who are against the felling of the so-called anne frank tree .
however , the judge still has the possibility to change his decision .
the 27-ton chestnut tree stands in a private garden overlooked by the achterhuis annex where the frank family hid during world war two . back on march 6 , the city of amsterdam granted the property owner permission to fell the tree in the interest of public safely .
tests undertaken by the city reveal that the chestnut , which is estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old , is diseased and several attempts to revive it have failed .
the tree 's owner wants it destroyed because under dutch law he is liable for any damage caused if it falls .
amsterdam authorities had planned to plant a tree genetically identical to the diseased chestnut in its place .

" all of this moved us so much that we could not speak . "
the anne frank foundation , which maintains the achterhuis as a museum about anne frank and the persecution of the jews , has adopted a neutral stance .
a spokesman for the foundation said that although it regrets that the tree has to be cut down , it understands that public safety comes first .
however , the dutch tree foundation and several neighbors who are opposed to felling the chestnut are appealing the decision .
they contest the authorities ' claim that 72 percent of the tree is diseased , and therefore could blow over at any time , saying that their own tests show the tree could be rescued .

the 27-ton chestnut tree stands in a private garden overlooked by the achterhuis annex where the frank family hid during world war two . back on march 6 , the city of amsterdam granted the property owner permission to fell the tree in the interest of public safely .
tests undertaken by the city reveal that the chestnut , which is estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old , is diseased and several attempts to revive it have failed .
the tree 's owner wants it destroyed because under dutch law he is liable for any damage caused if it falls .
amsterdam authorities had planned to plant a tree genetically identical to the diseased chestnut in its place .

" all of this moved us so much that we could not speak . "
the anne frank foundation , which maintains the achterhuis as a museum about anne frank and the persecution of the jews , has adopted a neutral stance .
a spokesman for the foundation said that although it regrets that the tree has to be cut down , it understands that public safety comes first .
however , the dutch tree foundation and several neighbors who are opposed to felling the chestnut are appealing the decision .
they contest the authorities ' claim that 72 percent of the tree is diseased , and therefore could blow over at any time , saying that their own tests show the tree could be rescued .

think again . the conflict began with a recent suggestion by national team representatives to hold a round-table discussion to talk about the poor showing by bundesliga sides in this year 's champions league and uefa cup competitions .
one of the issues to be discussed was a perceived lack of coherent soccer philosophy among german clubs . that raised the hackles of many club coaches and managers , and völler , who 's now commercial manager at leverkusen , took out his ire on bierhoff - a former german international . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff , left , has always been more of a politician " i would suggest oliver bierhoff show a bit more humility , " said völler in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker .
" with players who 've been trained at clubs like cologne , bayern munich , stuttgart , bremen and bayer leverkusen , you can put a philosophy into practice .
but a philosophy for a player like oliver bierhoff has yet to be invented .
you ca n't demand brazilian style if you yourself have feet from malta . " below the belt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : völler was germany 's national coach from 2000 to 2004 völler , rarely one to shy away from a good rant , continued to lambaste the germany manager . " in the next few days , oliver bierhoff should consult dr. müller-wohlfahrt -lsb- germany 's national team physician -rsb- , " völler said .
" he probably has some painful internal injuries resulting from permanently patting himself on the back . " there 's been no love lost between the suave bierhoff and the salt-of-the-earth völler since early 2002 , when then-national-coach völler stripped then-player bierhoff of his position as team captain .
bierhoff became germany 's manager in 2004 , when jürgen klinsmann took over as coach from völler . bierhoff has been quick to fire some salvos of his own .
" personally , it amazes me the way things go below the belt , if someone does n't have any arguments , " bierhoff shot back in a statement .
" this is the sort of criticism that comes out over a few beers at the pub .
i have to accept that fact , but it 's beneath my dignity . " media glee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff scored the winning goal for germany in the 1996 european championships final but the former top striker was clearly irritated by the jibe about him having feet from malta . " that 's absolute nonsense , " bierhoff huffed .
" i won the italian league with ac milan , was italy 's top goal scorer one year and am one of few players to have scored more than 100 goals . " bierhoff also scored 37 goals in 70 appearances for germany - 10 fewer than völler . the völler-bierhoff feud has completely overshadowed germany 's last euro 2008 qualifying match against wales on wednesday , nov .
21 , which is largely meaningless .
newspapers around the country have gleefully reprinted the insults and counter-insults , pouring further oil on the fiery relationship between the two former german soccer greats . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .
" but it 's the only way .
and the parents have to apply pressure from below . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , that it had obtained a restraining order against deutsche telekom prohibiting the telecommunications giant from selling apple 's iphone in germany without a mandatory calling plan . the stylish touchscreen phone and music player went on sale this month in germany with telekom as its exclusive vendor .
deutsche telekom requires buyers to sign up to a two-year contract with its t-mobile wireless network .
the german unit of vodafone took its grievance over the iphone 's exclusive use in t-mobile 's network and the use of the device being limited to certain fees within t-mobile 's subscription offerings to a regional court in hamburg .
the court then issued the restraining order on sales which will apply until a substantive argument is brought before a court .
temporary injunctions such as the one issued against telekom can be overturned on appeal .
t-mobile confirmed the restraining order has been issued , adding that the company was examining the issue .
vodafone aim not to stop sales completely vodafone germany chief executive friedrich joussen said that vodafone was n't generally opposed to t-mobile 's exclusivity contract with apple , adding that the company did not want to halt iphone sales but wanted to have these new sales practices examined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodafone will fight the iphone in germany with the qbowl " we want it to be available to buyers without a mandatory calling plan , " he said .
" if i had wanted to halt sales , i could have , but i did n't . "
joussen said he expected a substantive ruling within two weeks .
vodafone will launch its own multifunctional handheld-computer phone , the qbowl , before christmas as a direct competitor to telekom 's iphone monopoly .
apple has stipulated that in germany , as in the united states , the iphone should be placed in the hands of the leading mobile phone operator on condition the phones are dedicated to one network and that apple gets a cut of revenues .
the iphone contains a lock which prevents it from being used on any other network .
telekom sales practice could change industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french iphone is open to other networks by law while vodafone stated it was pursuing legal action only in germany as it felt specific national rules on access to networks were being broken , the company is actually concerned that other handset makers , such as nokia or ericsson , could adopt similar strategies .
the uk-based company fears that this could restrict consumers ' choice and disrupt mobile operators ' existing revenue streams .
in france , apple recruited france telecom 's orange mobile phone subsidiary to sell the iphone .
but national laws barring the locking of phones meant the us company had to offer devices that could work on any network .
crazy for iphone the release of the iphone in europe earlier this month caused mayhem .
deutsche telekom said it had sold more than 10,000 of the heavily hyped gadgets by mid-afternoon on nov .
9 , the first day on sale .
apple said it sold 1 million in the first 74 days after the device went on sale in the united states on june 29 .

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .
" but it 's the only way .
and the parents have to apply pressure from below . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

think again . the conflict began with a recent suggestion by national team representatives to hold a round-table discussion to talk about the poor showing by bundesliga sides in this year 's champions league and uefa cup competitions .
one of the issues to be discussed was a perceived lack of coherent soccer philosophy among german clubs . that raised the hackles of many club coaches and managers , and völler , who 's now commercial manager at leverkusen , took out his ire on bierhoff - a former german international . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff , left , has always been more of a politician " i would suggest oliver bierhoff show a bit more humility , " said völler in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker .
" with players who 've been trained at clubs like cologne , bayern munich , stuttgart , bremen and bayer leverkusen , you can put a philosophy into practice .
but a philosophy for a player like oliver bierhoff has yet to be invented .
you ca n't demand brazilian style if you yourself have feet from malta . " below the belt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : völler was germany 's national coach from 2000 to 2004 völler , rarely one to shy away from a good rant , continued to lambaste the germany manager . " in the next few days , oliver bierhoff should consult dr. müller-wohlfahrt -lsb- germany 's national team physician -rsb- , " völler said .
" he probably has some painful internal injuries resulting from permanently patting himself on the back . " there 's been no love lost between the suave bierhoff and the salt-of-the-earth völler since early 2002 , when then-national-coach völler stripped then-player bierhoff of his position as team captain .
bierhoff became germany 's manager in 2004 , when jürgen klinsmann took over as coach from völler . bierhoff has been quick to fire some salvos of his own .
" personally , it amazes me the way things go below the belt , if someone does n't have any arguments , " bierhoff shot back in a statement .
" this is the sort of criticism that comes out over a few beers at the pub .
i have to accept that fact , but it 's beneath my dignity . " media glee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff scored the winning goal for germany in the 1996 european championships final but the former top striker was clearly irritated by the jibe about him having feet from malta . " that 's absolute nonsense , " bierhoff huffed .
" i won the italian league with ac milan , was italy 's top goal scorer one year and am one of few players to have scored more than 100 goals . " bierhoff also scored 37 goals in 70 appearances for germany - 10 fewer than völler . the völler-bierhoff feud has completely overshadowed germany 's last euro 2008 qualifying match against wales on wednesday , nov .

20 , joining a week-long stoppage by rail workers . the nationwide protests , which are over issues ranging from pension reform to the cost of living , had disrupted hospitals , schools , trains , postal services and airports .
they are seen as the biggest threat to sarkozy 's planned reforms since he was elected president in may .
according to a new csa survey , sarkozy 's approval rating has fallen five points this month alone , to 51 percent .
asked if the transport strike , now in its eight day , could hurt the economy , public accounts minister eric woerth said on tuesday : " not over several days .
but if it lasted longer , it could obviously have consequences . "
" when you decide not to work , when you prevent goods from circulating in a certain way , when you prevent people from getting to places , obviously that can be a problem at some point , " woerth told france inter radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes are a test for sarkozy the rail workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to scrap some public sector pension rights .
they voted to continue the strike they began on nov .
13 so that it overlapped with tuesday 's one-day walk out by civil servants .
opinion polls show the rail strike is unpopular with most french voters , but a majority sympathizes with the civil servants ' strike .
one-day civil servant walk-out the striking public-sector workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to cut 23,000 jobs in 2008 - half of them in education - by not replacing retiring civil servants .
some 58 percent of high-school teachers were participating in tuesday 's walk-out in paris , a union official said .
unions representing 5.2 million state employees - around a quarter of the entire workforce - also said their spending power had fallen by six percent since 2000 and were demanding pay rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air transport is also distrupted france 's postal service , la poste , said about 15 percent of its mailmen and women were on strike , while meteorologists , bank workers and hospital staff were also among those downing tools .
international flights were cancelled and delayed as air traffic control staff at some airports went on strike .
paris ' two airports reported average flight delays of around 40 minutes , and services at marseille airport , in the country 's south , have also been affected .
tuesday 's walkout is the third nationwide civil servants ' strike this year .
the 24-hour strike coincided with student protests , which disrupted classes in half of the country 's 85 universities in a campaign against a law giving faculties the right to raise money from private companies .
the french also awoke to find their newsstands empty of papers as distributors began a one-day strike over planned restructuring that is expected to lead to job losses .
striking energy workers cut 5,500 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- , or about 8.7 percent of production capacity , at edf nuclear plants earlier in the morning , the leading energy union said .
public transport in disarray state rail operator sncf has said the number of people involved in the rail strike , which affected national trains as well as paris subway and bus services , had fallen since it began last tuesday , but public transport continued to be disrupted .
bildunterschrift : the rail strike is becoming increasingly unpopular as many commuters changed from trains to cars , traffic jams stretched over more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- across france on tuesday morning .
sncf said about half its high-speed tgv trains would run on tuesday and the eurostar link with london would run normally .
talks with rail unions were due to start on wednesday .
the government has dropped its demand that the strike end before the talks get underway and instead said there simply should be a " back-to-work dynamic . "
the walk-out was over plans to increase contribution periods for the 500,000 workers - mainly in the rail and energy sectors - who enjoy " special " pension systems and can retire on full pensions as early as age 50 .

think again . the conflict began with a recent suggestion by national team representatives to hold a round-table discussion to talk about the poor showing by bundesliga sides in this year 's champions league and uefa cup competitions .
one of the issues to be discussed was a perceived lack of coherent soccer philosophy among german clubs . that raised the hackles of many club coaches and managers , and völler , who 's now commercial manager at leverkusen , took out his ire on bierhoff - a former german international . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff , left , has always been more of a politician " i would suggest oliver bierhoff show a bit more humility , " said völler in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker .
" with players who 've been trained at clubs like cologne , bayern munich , stuttgart , bremen and bayer leverkusen , you can put a philosophy into practice .
but a philosophy for a player like oliver bierhoff has yet to be invented .
you ca n't demand brazilian style if you yourself have feet from malta . " below the belt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : völler was germany 's national coach from 2000 to 2004 völler , rarely one to shy away from a good rant , continued to lambaste the germany manager . " in the next few days , oliver bierhoff should consult dr. müller-wohlfahrt -lsb- germany 's national team physician -rsb- , " völler said .
" he probably has some painful internal injuries resulting from permanently patting himself on the back . " there 's been no love lost between the suave bierhoff and the salt-of-the-earth völler since early 2002 , when then-national-coach völler stripped then-player bierhoff of his position as team captain .
bierhoff became germany 's manager in 2004 , when jürgen klinsmann took over as coach from völler . bierhoff has been quick to fire some salvos of his own .
" personally , it amazes me the way things go below the belt , if someone does n't have any arguments , " bierhoff shot back in a statement .
" this is the sort of criticism that comes out over a few beers at the pub .
i have to accept that fact , but it 's beneath my dignity . " media glee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff scored the winning goal for germany in the 1996 european championships final but the former top striker was clearly irritated by the jibe about him having feet from malta . " that 's absolute nonsense , " bierhoff huffed .
" i won the italian league with ac milan , was italy 's top goal scorer one year and am one of few players to have scored more than 100 goals . " bierhoff also scored 37 goals in 70 appearances for germany - 10 fewer than völler . the völler-bierhoff feud has completely overshadowed germany 's last euro 2008 qualifying match against wales on wednesday , nov .
21 , which is largely meaningless .

they are seen as the biggest threat to sarkozy 's planned reforms since he was elected president in may .
according to a new csa survey , sarkozy 's approval rating has fallen five points this month alone , to 51 percent .
asked if the transport strike , now in its eight day , could hurt the economy , public accounts minister eric woerth said on tuesday : " not over several days .
but if it lasted longer , it could obviously have consequences . "
" when you decide not to work , when you prevent goods from circulating in a certain way , when you prevent people from getting to places , obviously that can be a problem at some point , " woerth told france inter radio .

opinion polls show the rail strike is unpopular with most french voters , but a majority sympathizes with the civil servants ' strike .
one-day civil servant walk-out the striking public-sector workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to cut 23,000 jobs in 2008 - half of them in education - by not replacing retiring civil servants .
some 58 percent of high-school teachers were participating in tuesday 's walk-out in paris , a union official said .
unions representing 5.2 million state employees - around a quarter of the entire workforce - also said their spending power had fallen by six percent since 2000 and were demanding pay rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air transport is also distrupted france 's postal service , la poste , said about 15 percent of its mailmen and women were on strike , while meteorologists , bank workers and hospital staff were also among those downing tools .
international flights were cancelled and delayed as air traffic control staff at some airports went on strike .
paris ' two airports reported average flight delays of around 40 minutes , and services at marseille airport , in the country 's south , have also been affected .
tuesday 's walkout is the third nationwide civil servants ' strike this year .
the 24-hour strike coincided with student protests , which disrupted classes in half of the country 's 85 universities in a campaign against a law giving faculties the right to raise money from private companies .
the french also awoke to find their newsstands empty of papers as distributors began a one-day strike over planned restructuring that is expected to lead to job losses .
striking energy workers cut 5,500 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- , or about 8.7 percent of production capacity , at edf nuclear plants earlier in the morning , the leading energy union said .
public transport in disarray state rail operator sncf has said the number of people involved in the rail strike , which affected national trains as well as paris subway and bus services , had fallen since it began last tuesday , but public transport continued to be disrupted .

20 , joining a week-long stoppage by rail workers . the nationwide protests , which are over issues ranging from pension reform to the cost of living , had disrupted hospitals , schools , trains , postal services and airports .
they are seen as the biggest threat to sarkozy 's planned reforms since he was elected president in may .
according to a new csa survey , sarkozy 's approval rating has fallen five points this month alone , to 51 percent .
asked if the transport strike , now in its eight day , could hurt the economy , public accounts minister eric woerth said on tuesday : " not over several days .
but if it lasted longer , it could obviously have consequences . "
" when you decide not to work , when you prevent goods from circulating in a certain way , when you prevent people from getting to places , obviously that can be a problem at some point , " woerth told france inter radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes are a test for sarkozy the rail workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to scrap some public sector pension rights .
they voted to continue the strike they began on nov .
13 so that it overlapped with tuesday 's one-day walk out by civil servants .
opinion polls show the rail strike is unpopular with most french voters , but a majority sympathizes with the civil servants ' strike .
one-day civil servant walk-out the striking public-sector workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to cut 23,000 jobs in 2008 - half of them in education - by not replacing retiring civil servants .

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .
" but it 's the only way .
and the parents have to apply pressure from below . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as history teaches us , european policy has caused many injuries over the centuries to small nations - for example , to albania after leaving half of that nation outside its own territory in 1913 .
the worst is that of slavic regimes , who have used a brutal way of governing minorities over the centuries by killing millions of innocent people .
this must not happen anymore and the kosovo case should be a lesson to dictators -lsb- such -rsb- as milosevic and his friends , but also to other politicians .

the muslims were murdering even then any christian they could catch alone .
they referred to themselves as turks .
i presume they are the leftovers of the ottoman empire .
kosovo must remain a part of serbia .
the usa was and is conducting the wrong diplomacy .
i believe it is influenced by the need for oil from saudi arabia .
europe does not need another islamic government . - alexius lessig , us kosovo belongs to serbia and the russian republic wo n't let the serbian province declare independence . - arthur cardoso da costa junior , brazil giving independence to what is essentially the heart of serbia is like giving a big chunk of berlin to turks or malmo to north africans or bradford to pakistanis or marseilles to the arabs .

the site dedicated to showing people 's self-made films has a breakthrough act in munich singer mina . the 14-year old has become a huge hit , not only on the video platform but also in the music charts , thanks to one clip of her singing .
now , she has an apartment in her name , a recording contract and a hit single , " how the angels fly . " the clip of mina singing attracted three million visitors and the attentions of the starwatch label which searches and promotes new talent in cooperation with german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the youngster 's music career is now well and truly off the launch pad , with no little help from magic internet , the company which runs myvideo . but the video hosting site is not looking for gratitude or royalty payments .
the fact that germany 's latest starlet sprang from the berlin-based company 's portal is thanks enough .
a talented and pretty new star is a great advert for a small firm of 20 staff which has now been catapulted into germany 's internet elite by capitalizing on the wide-reaching possibilities of web 2.0 . ideal platform for those seeking fleeting fame the basis for myvideo 's success since it was launched in march 2006 is simple .
people want to be famous .
it seems that andy warhol 's assertion that everyone will be famous for 15 minutes does n't rate highly with the new generation of self-publicists .
five minutes will do .
and myvideo provides the ideal platform for this fleeting flirtation with fame . " the users want to present themselves , they want the chance to become famous for five minutes " , christian vollmann , manager of magic internet said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube leads the sector but myvideo has big plans it does n't seem to matter what they do to become famous either .
videos of cleaning mishaps , crazy pets , teen-angst monologues and wannabes singing in their bedrooms all share space on the portal .
more than half of those who appear are under 30 years old . it is , however , a fiercely competitive sector .

the site dedicated to showing people 's self-made films has a breakthrough act in munich singer mina . the 14-year old has become a huge hit , not only on the video platform but also in the music charts , thanks to one clip of her singing .
now , she has an apartment in her name , a recording contract and a hit single , " how the angels fly . " the clip of mina singing attracted three million visitors and the attentions of the starwatch label which searches and promotes new talent in cooperation with german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the youngster 's music career is now well and truly off the launch pad , with no little help from magic internet , the company which runs myvideo . but the video hosting site is not looking for gratitude or royalty payments .
the fact that germany 's latest starlet sprang from the berlin-based company 's portal is thanks enough .

people want to be famous .
it seems that andy warhol 's assertion that everyone will be famous for 15 minutes does n't rate highly with the new generation of self-publicists .

it tastes the same all over but comes with different frills depending on the region .
however , some believe it should be officially recognized as a berlin speciality . those interfering europeans are at it again .
less than two weeks ago , a major diplomatic incident was avoided when the european union allowed the german specialty apfelwein to continue being known as a wine .
it was a close call .
if the eu had pushed through with its idea to bless only those drinks made from grapes with the term , the forces of the state of hessen would have risen up and gotten really , really angry .
luckily , for everyone involved and the wider world in general , the eurocrats and the overly-protective germans called off hostilities and avoided a potentially deadly exchange of handbags .

berlin butchers want to claim capital as currywurst 's home a group of berlin butchers have another idea and have joined together to patent the currywurst sausage .
the butchers ' objective is to " geographically " protect their culinary invention , the 1949 creation of one herta heuwer , a berliner who served her snack day and night in the western part of the then divided city .
they want the spot of her famous food stall , which was an institution at the time , to be officially recognized as the home of the currywurst .
the potential spat is still at the diplomatic level and has not yet reached the bellicose rhetoric of the apfelwein rebellion of early november .
the sausage separatists have so far followed the protocol laid down by the un savory snack council and have filed a patent request with the european patent office .
even if the currywurst crisis is averted on a pan-european level , there are still fears that a civil sausage war could break out between states and regions in germany .

frank , a jewish girl who hid from the nazis for more than two years , mentioned the tree several times in her famous diary . after visiting the chestnut tree , the judge at the amsterdam administrative court decided on tuesday , nov .
20 to temporarily rescind permission to cut it down .
this was in response to a case brought by several groups who are against the felling of the so-called anne frank tree .
however , the judge still has the possibility to change his decision .
the 27-ton chestnut tree stands in a private garden overlooked by the achterhuis annex where the frank family hid during world war two . back on march 6 , the city of amsterdam granted the property owner permission to fell the tree in the interest of public safely .
tests undertaken by the city reveal that the chestnut , which is estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old , is diseased and several attempts to revive it have failed .
the tree 's owner wants it destroyed because under dutch law he is liable for any damage caused if it falls .
amsterdam authorities had planned to plant a tree genetically identical to the diseased chestnut in its place .
tree symbol of life outside of hiding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frank family 's hiding place is now a museum anne frank wrote in her diary on february 23 , 1944 : " we both looked up to the blue sky , the horse chestnut whose bare branches glittered with droplets , the gulls and the other birds that seemed made of silver as they swooped by .
" all of this moved us so much that we could not speak . "
the anne frank foundation , which maintains the achterhuis as a museum about anne frank and the persecution of the jews , has adopted a neutral stance .
a spokesman for the foundation said that although it regrets that the tree has to be cut down , it understands that public safety comes first .
however , the dutch tree foundation and several neighbors who are opposed to felling the chestnut are appealing the decision .
they contest the authorities ' claim that 72 percent of the tree is diseased , and therefore could blow over at any time , saying that their own tests show the tree could be rescued .
a so-called administration court , which settles conflicts between citizens and administrative authorities , is to hear both sides prior to the planned felling .

anne frank , along with her sister margot , died of typhus in bergen belsen concentration camp , in the north of germany .
otto frank , anne frank 's father , was the only survivor .
after the war , miep gies , who provided the group with basic necessities while in hiding , gave him the diary his youngest daughter anne had written during that period .

frank , a jewish girl who hid from the nazis for more than two years , mentioned the tree several times in her famous diary . after visiting the chestnut tree , the judge at the amsterdam administrative court decided on tuesday , nov .
20 to temporarily rescind permission to cut it down .
this was in response to a case brought by several groups who are against the felling of the so-called anne frank tree .
however , the judge still has the possibility to change his decision .
the 27-ton chestnut tree stands in a private garden overlooked by the achterhuis annex where the frank family hid during world war two . back on march 6 , the city of amsterdam granted the property owner permission to fell the tree in the interest of public safely .
tests undertaken by the city reveal that the chestnut , which is estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old , is diseased and several attempts to revive it have failed .
the tree 's owner wants it destroyed because under dutch law he is liable for any damage caused if it falls .
amsterdam authorities had planned to plant a tree genetically identical to the diseased chestnut in its place .
tree symbol of life outside of hiding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frank family 's hiding place is now a museum anne frank wrote in her diary on february 23 , 1944 : " we both looked up to the blue sky , the horse chestnut whose bare branches glittered with droplets , the gulls and the other birds that seemed made of silver as they swooped by .
" all of this moved us so much that we could not speak . "
the anne frank foundation , which maintains the achterhuis as a museum about anne frank and the persecution of the jews , has adopted a neutral stance .
a spokesman for the foundation said that although it regrets that the tree has to be cut down , it understands that public safety comes first .
however , the dutch tree foundation and several neighbors who are opposed to felling the chestnut are appealing the decision .
they contest the authorities ' claim that 72 percent of the tree is diseased , and therefore could blow over at any time , saying that their own tests show the tree could be rescued .
a so-called administration court , which settles conflicts between citizens and administrative authorities , is to hear both sides prior to the planned felling .
death in a concentration camp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank died at the age of fifteen in bergen belsen a total of eight jews hid in the achterhuis between 1942 and 1944 until they were betrayed in august 1944 .
the germans subsequently deported them to concentration camps , where some were killed and others succumbed following starvation and illness .
anne frank , along with her sister margot , died of typhus in bergen belsen concentration camp , in the north of germany .
otto frank , anne frank 's father , was the only survivor .
after the war , miep gies , who provided the group with basic necessities while in hiding , gave him the diary his youngest daughter anne had written during that period .
following its publication in 1947 , the diary of anne frank became one of the most famous documents recounting the nazi persecution of the jews during world war two . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

frank , a jewish girl who hid from the nazis for more than two years , mentioned the tree several times in her famous diary . after visiting the chestnut tree , the judge at the amsterdam administrative court decided on tuesday , nov .
20 to temporarily rescind permission to cut it down .
this was in response to a case brought by several groups who are against the felling of the so-called anne frank tree .
however , the judge still has the possibility to change his decision .
the 27-ton chestnut tree stands in a private garden overlooked by the achterhuis annex where the frank family hid during world war two . back on march 6 , the city of amsterdam granted the property owner permission to fell the tree in the interest of public safely .
tests undertaken by the city reveal that the chestnut , which is estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old , is diseased and several attempts to revive it have failed .
the tree 's owner wants it destroyed because under dutch law he is liable for any damage caused if it falls .
amsterdam authorities had planned to plant a tree genetically identical to the diseased chestnut in its place .

" all of this moved us so much that we could not speak . "
the anne frank foundation , which maintains the achterhuis as a museum about anne frank and the persecution of the jews , has adopted a neutral stance .
a spokesman for the foundation said that although it regrets that the tree has to be cut down , it understands that public safety comes first .
however , the dutch tree foundation and several neighbors who are opposed to felling the chestnut are appealing the decision .
they contest the authorities ' claim that 72 percent of the tree is diseased , and therefore could blow over at any time , saying that their own tests show the tree could be rescued .
a so-called administration court , which settles conflicts between citizens and administrative authorities , is to hear both sides prior to the planned felling .

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .
" but it 's the only way .
and the parents have to apply pressure from below . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .

" sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .

some thought it was about time the majority muslim serbian province was set free , others thought independence would cause further instability in the balkans . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as history teaches us , european policy has caused many injuries over the centuries to small nations - for example , to albania after leaving half of that nation outside its own territory in 1913 .
the worst is that of slavic regimes , who have used a brutal way of governing minorities over the centuries by killing millions of innocent people .
this must not happen anymore and the kosovo case should be a lesson to dictators -lsb- such -rsb- as milosevic and his friends , but also to other politicians .
kosovo will be the world 's newest state . - edmond , albania i traveled through this area in 1954 and stayed in pristina for four days .
the muslims were murdering even then any christian they could catch alone .
they referred to themselves as turks .
i presume they are the leftovers of the ottoman empire .
kosovo must remain a part of serbia .
the usa was and is conducting the wrong diplomacy .
i believe it is influenced by the need for oil from saudi arabia .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as history teaches us , european policy has caused many injuries over the centuries to small nations - for example , to albania after leaving half of that nation outside its own territory in 1913 .
the worst is that of slavic regimes , who have used a brutal way of governing minorities over the centuries by killing millions of innocent people .
this must not happen anymore and the kosovo case should be a lesson to dictators -lsb- such -rsb- as milosevic and his friends , but also to other politicians .
kosovo will be the world 's newest state . - edmond , albania i traveled through this area in 1954 and stayed in pristina for four days .
the muslims were murdering even then any christian they could catch alone .
they referred to themselves as turks .
i presume they are the leftovers of the ottoman empire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 20.11.2007 berlin butchers join forces to protect the " home " of currywurst großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin butchers believe the currywurst was born in the capital and want the eu to agree wherever you go in germany , you can get a currywurst .
it tastes the same all over but comes with different frills depending on the region .
however , some believe it should be officially recognized as a berlin speciality . those interfering europeans are at it again .
less than two weeks ago , a major diplomatic incident was avoided when the european union allowed the german specialty apfelwein to continue being known as a wine .
it was a close call .
if the eu had pushed through with its idea to bless only those drinks made from grapes with the term , the forces of the state of hessen would have risen up and gotten really , really angry .
luckily , for everyone involved and the wider world in general , the eurocrats and the overly-protective germans called off hostilities and avoided a potentially deadly exchange of handbags .
now , however , it seems as though the eu is set on provoking further german ire by targeting the sacred currywurst .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " konnopkes imbiss " : berlin 's most famous wurst stand as a german-wide culinary phenomenon , the eu believes that the delicacy - a fried pork sausage cut into slices drowned in ketchup , curry and tomato concentrate - can be made , cooked and sold under the term anywhere in the country .
berlin butchers want to claim capital as currywurst 's home a group of berlin butchers have another idea and have joined together to patent the currywurst sausage .
the butchers ' objective is to " geographically " protect their culinary invention , the 1949 creation of one herta heuwer , a berliner who served her snack day and night in the western part of the then divided city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 20.11.2007 völler , bierhoff trade insults over german soccer future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the feud is the latest in a series of verbal explosions by völler ex-national coach rudi völler and current team manager oliver bierhoff are locked in a war of words over whether germany is properly developing players - and the debate has gotten very nasty . with germany having easily qualified for the euro 2008 , one would think that everything would be hunky-dory between the national team and the bundesliga 's clubs .
think again . the conflict began with a recent suggestion by national team representatives to hold a round-table discussion to talk about the poor showing by bundesliga sides in this year 's champions league and uefa cup competitions .
one of the issues to be discussed was a perceived lack of coherent soccer philosophy among german clubs . that raised the hackles of many club coaches and managers , and völler , who 's now commercial manager at leverkusen , took out his ire on bierhoff - a former german international . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff , left , has always been more of a politician " i would suggest oliver bierhoff show a bit more humility , " said völler in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker .
" with players who 've been trained at clubs like cologne , bayern munich , stuttgart , bremen and bayer leverkusen , you can put a philosophy into practice .
but a philosophy for a player like oliver bierhoff has yet to be invented .
you ca n't demand brazilian style if you yourself have feet from malta . " below the belt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : völler was germany 's national coach from 2000 to 2004 völler , rarely one to shy away from a good rant , continued to lambaste the germany manager . " in the next few days , oliver bierhoff should consult dr. müller-wohlfahrt -lsb- germany 's national team physician -rsb- , " völler said .
" he probably has some painful internal injuries resulting from permanently patting himself on the back . " there 's been no love lost between the suave bierhoff and the salt-of-the-earth völler since early 2002 , when then-national-coach völler stripped then-player bierhoff of his position as team captain .
bierhoff became germany 's manager in 2004 , when jürgen klinsmann took over as coach from völler . bierhoff has been quick to fire some salvos of his own .
" personally , it amazes me the way things go below the belt , if someone does n't have any arguments , " bierhoff shot back in a statement .
" this is the sort of criticism that comes out over a few beers at the pub .
i have to accept that fact , but it 's beneath my dignity . " media glee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff scored the winning goal for germany in the 1996 european championships final but the former top striker was clearly irritated by the jibe about him having feet from malta . " that 's absolute nonsense , " bierhoff huffed .
" i won the italian league with ac milan , was italy 's top goal scorer one year and am one of few players to have scored more than 100 goals .

20 , joining a week-long stoppage by rail workers . the nationwide protests , which are over issues ranging from pension reform to the cost of living , had disrupted hospitals , schools , trains , postal services and airports .
they are seen as the biggest threat to sarkozy 's planned reforms since he was elected president in may .
according to a new csa survey , sarkozy 's approval rating has fallen five points this month alone , to 51 percent .
asked if the transport strike , now in its eight day , could hurt the economy , public accounts minister eric woerth said on tuesday : " not over several days .
but if it lasted longer , it could obviously have consequences . "
" when you decide not to work , when you prevent goods from circulating in a certain way , when you prevent people from getting to places , obviously that can be a problem at some point , " woerth told france inter radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes are a test for sarkozy the rail workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to scrap some public sector pension rights .
they voted to continue the strike they began on nov .
13 so that it overlapped with tuesday 's one-day walk out by civil servants .
opinion polls show the rail strike is unpopular with most french voters , but a majority sympathizes with the civil servants ' strike .
one-day civil servant walk-out the striking public-sector workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to cut 23,000 jobs in 2008 - half of them in education - by not replacing retiring civil servants .
some 58 percent of high-school teachers were participating in tuesday 's walk-out in paris , a union official said .
unions representing 5.2 million state employees - around a quarter of the entire workforce - also said their spending power had fallen by six percent since 2000 and were demanding pay rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air transport is also distrupted france 's postal service , la poste , said about 15 percent of its mailmen and women were on strike , while meteorologists , bank workers and hospital staff were also among those downing tools .
international flights were cancelled and delayed as air traffic control staff at some airports went on strike .
paris ' two airports reported average flight delays of around 40 minutes , and services at marseille airport , in the country 's south , have also been affected .
tuesday 's walkout is the third nationwide civil servants ' strike this year .
the 24-hour strike coincided with student protests , which disrupted classes in half of the country 's 85 universities in a campaign against a law giving faculties the right to raise money from private companies .
the french also awoke to find their newsstands empty of papers as distributors began a one-day strike over planned restructuring that is expected to lead to job losses .
striking energy workers cut 5,500 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- , or about 8.7 percent of production capacity , at edf nuclear plants earlier in the morning , the leading energy union said .
public transport in disarray state rail operator sncf has said the number of people involved in the rail strike , which affected national trains as well as paris subway and bus services , had fallen since it began last tuesday , but public transport continued to be disrupted .
bildunterschrift : the rail strike is becoming increasingly unpopular as many commuters changed from trains to cars , traffic jams stretched over more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- across france on tuesday morning .
sncf said about half its high-speed tgv trains would run on tuesday and the eurostar link with london would run normally .
talks with rail unions were due to start on wednesday .
the government has dropped its demand that the strike end before the talks get underway and instead said there simply should be a " back-to-work dynamic . "
the walk-out was over plans to increase contribution periods for the 500,000 workers - mainly in the rail and energy sectors - who enjoy " special " pension systems and can retire on full pensions as early as age 50 .
and more strikes are expected : tobacconists are due to shut up shop on wednesday to protest against new anti-smoking laws , and french judges and lawyers have planned a strike on nov .

20 , joining a week-long stoppage by rail workers . the nationwide protests , which are over issues ranging from pension reform to the cost of living , had disrupted hospitals , schools , trains , postal services and airports .
they are seen as the biggest threat to sarkozy 's planned reforms since he was elected president in may .
according to a new csa survey , sarkozy 's approval rating has fallen five points this month alone , to 51 percent .
asked if the transport strike , now in its eight day , could hurt the economy , public accounts minister eric woerth said on tuesday : " not over several days .
but if it lasted longer , it could obviously have consequences . "
" when you decide not to work , when you prevent goods from circulating in a certain way , when you prevent people from getting to places , obviously that can be a problem at some point , " woerth told france inter radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes are a test for sarkozy the rail workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to scrap some public sector pension rights .
they voted to continue the strike they began on nov .
13 so that it overlapped with tuesday 's one-day walk out by civil servants .
opinion polls show the rail strike is unpopular with most french voters , but a majority sympathizes with the civil servants ' strike .
one-day civil servant walk-out the striking public-sector workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to cut 23,000 jobs in 2008 - half of them in education - by not replacing retiring civil servants .
some 58 percent of high-school teachers were participating in tuesday 's walk-out in paris , a union official said .
unions representing 5.2 million state employees - around a quarter of the entire workforce - also said their spending power had fallen by six percent since 2000 and were demanding pay rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air transport is also distrupted france 's postal service , la poste , said about 15 percent of its mailmen and women were on strike , while meteorologists , bank workers and hospital staff were also among those downing tools .
international flights were cancelled and delayed as air traffic control staff at some airports went on strike .
paris ' two airports reported average flight delays of around 40 minutes , and services at marseille airport , in the country 's south , have also been affected .
tuesday 's walkout is the third nationwide civil servants ' strike this year .
the 24-hour strike coincided with student protests , which disrupted classes in half of the country 's 85 universities in a campaign against a law giving faculties the right to raise money from private companies .
the french also awoke to find their newsstands empty of papers as distributors began a one-day strike over planned restructuring that is expected to lead to job losses .
striking energy workers cut 5,500 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- , or about 8.7 percent of production capacity , at edf nuclear plants earlier in the morning , the leading energy union said .
public transport in disarray state rail operator sncf has said the number of people involved in the rail strike , which affected national trains as well as paris subway and bus services , had fallen since it began last tuesday , but public transport continued to be disrupted .
bildunterschrift : the rail strike is becoming increasingly unpopular as many commuters changed from trains to cars , traffic jams stretched over more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- across france on tuesday morning .
sncf said about half its high-speed tgv trains would run on tuesday and the eurostar link with london would run normally .
talks with rail unions were due to start on wednesday .
the government has dropped its demand that the strike end before the talks get underway and instead said there simply should be a " back-to-work dynamic . "
the walk-out was over plans to increase contribution periods for the 500,000 workers - mainly in the rail and energy sectors - who enjoy " special " pension systems and can retire on full pensions as early as age 50 .
and more strikes are expected : tobacconists are due to shut up shop on wednesday to protest against new anti-smoking laws , and french judges and lawyers have planned a strike on nov .

the site dedicated to showing people 's self-made films has a breakthrough act in munich singer mina . the 14-year old has become a huge hit , not only on the video platform but also in the music charts , thanks to one clip of her singing .
now , she has an apartment in her name , a recording contract and a hit single , " how the angels fly . " the clip of mina singing attracted three million visitors and the attentions of the starwatch label which searches and promotes new talent in cooperation with german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the youngster 's music career is now well and truly off the launch pad , with no little help from magic internet , the company which runs myvideo . but the video hosting site is not looking for gratitude or royalty payments .
the fact that germany 's latest starlet sprang from the berlin-based company 's portal is thanks enough .
a talented and pretty new star is a great advert for a small firm of 20 staff which has now been catapulted into germany 's internet elite by capitalizing on the wide-reaching possibilities of web 2.0 . ideal platform for those seeking fleeting fame the basis for myvideo 's success since it was launched in march 2006 is simple .
people want to be famous .
it seems that andy warhol 's assertion that everyone will be famous for 15 minutes does n't rate highly with the new generation of self-publicists .
five minutes will do .
and myvideo provides the ideal platform for this fleeting flirtation with fame . " the users want to present themselves , they want the chance to become famous for five minutes " , christian vollmann , manager of magic internet said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube leads the sector but myvideo has big plans it does n't seem to matter what they do to become famous either .
videos of cleaning mishaps , crazy pets , teen-angst monologues and wannabes singing in their bedrooms all share space on the portal .
more than half of those who appear are under 30 years old . it is , however , a fiercely competitive sector .
myvideo 's attraction is that it is a young and hip portal .
while this makes it popular with a certain demographic , it also leads to a creative chaos which the sector leader , youtube , keeps under control and which german challengers like clipfish and sevenload try to avoid . mina inspires myvideo to plan expansion however , if the internet free-for-all results in a mina every 18 months , myvideo would gladly accept it .

it tastes the same all over but comes with different frills depending on the region .
however , some believe it should be officially recognized as a berlin speciality . those interfering europeans are at it again .
less than two weeks ago , a major diplomatic incident was avoided when the european union allowed the german specialty apfelwein to continue being known as a wine .
it was a close call .
if the eu had pushed through with its idea to bless only those drinks made from grapes with the term , the forces of the state of hessen would have risen up and gotten really , really angry .
luckily , for everyone involved and the wider world in general , the eurocrats and the overly-protective germans called off hostilities and avoided a potentially deadly exchange of handbags .
now , however , it seems as though the eu is set on provoking further german ire by targeting the sacred currywurst .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " konnopkes imbiss " : berlin 's most famous wurst stand as a german-wide culinary phenomenon , the eu believes that the delicacy - a fried pork sausage cut into slices drowned in ketchup , curry and tomato concentrate - can be made , cooked and sold under the term anywhere in the country .
berlin butchers want to claim capital as currywurst 's home a group of berlin butchers have another idea and have joined together to patent the currywurst sausage .
the butchers ' objective is to " geographically " protect their culinary invention , the 1949 creation of one herta heuwer , a berliner who served her snack day and night in the western part of the then divided city .
they want the spot of her famous food stall , which was an institution at the time , to be officially recognized as the home of the currywurst .
the potential spat is still at the diplomatic level and has not yet reached the bellicose rhetoric of the apfelwein rebellion of early november .
the sausage separatists have so far followed the protocol laid down by the un savory snack council and have filed a patent request with the european patent office .
even if the currywurst crisis is averted on a pan-european level , there are still fears that a civil sausage war could break out between states and regions in germany .
north could make a claim against berlin patent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern german states may contest berlin 's claim northern german states and cities would be those most likely to take offense to the berlin claim should the patent be agreed .
the currywurst enjoys cult status in many areas and some believe its birthplace to be further north than the capital .
the tension is unlikely to abate any time soon .
the patent application procedure lasts between two and three years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 by the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- has projected that by 2012 , the industrial nations that signed and ratified the kyoto convention are on track to emit 10.8 percent less greenhouse gasses than they did in 1990 .
the european union as a whole is on track to meet its kyoto targets , but only by making use of mechanisms such as emissions trading , according to the report .
britain , france , germany and sweden are the only pre-enlargement eu-15 countries expected to meet the 2012 goal without implementing additional measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and australia are the two industrialized nations refusing to ratify kyoto the kyoto protocol commits 36 industrialized countries to a five percent reduction target from 2008 to 2012 compared to 1990 .
industrial countries ' emissions surging however , the total greenhouse gas emissions from the world 's industrialized nations has been growing since 2000 , reaching a near-record in 2005 and continuing to move upward .
reductions between 1990 and 2000 lead to an overall reduction for some kyoto signers , despite the upward swing that followed .
" greenhouse-gas emissions between 1990 and 2000 went down , but then between 2000 and 2005 they increased again , by 2.6 percent , " unfccc executive secretary yvo de boer said tuesday at a press conference held in bonn , germany 's former capital .
the unfccc blamed continued growth in western economies and a revival of growth in former east bloc nations , with pollution from transport being the biggest culprit in any sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is already wreacking havoc with entire ecosystems the united states , which is the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gases but has refused to sign the kyoto agreement , emitted 16.3 percent more greenhouse gases in 2005 than in 1990 , the report noted .
" emissions trends around the world and especially in industrialized countries are worrying , " de boer said .
kyoto to be discussed on bali the unfccc presented its emissions data findings two weeks ahead of a united nations climate conference on bali , indonesia , at which negotiations on a post-kyoto deal are expected to be launched .
representatives from more than 180 countries , together with researchers and observers , will attend the conference .
de boer set a triple benchmark to judge bali 's success .
" if there is a decision to launch negotiations , if an agenda for negotiations is agreed and if an end-date -lrb- for completing negotiations -rrb- is set , then i would consider bali to be a success , " he said .

some thought it was about time the majority muslim serbian province was set free , others thought independence would cause further instability in the balkans . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as history teaches us , european policy has caused many injuries over the centuries to small nations - for example , to albania after leaving half of that nation outside its own territory in 1913 .
the worst is that of slavic regimes , who have used a brutal way of governing minorities over the centuries by killing millions of innocent people .
this must not happen anymore and the kosovo case should be a lesson to dictators -lsb- such -rsb- as milosevic and his friends , but also to other politicians .
kosovo will be the world 's newest state . - edmond , albania i traveled through this area in 1954 and stayed in pristina for four days .
the muslims were murdering even then any christian they could catch alone .
they referred to themselves as turks .
i presume they are the leftovers of the ottoman empire .
kosovo must remain a part of serbia .
the usa was and is conducting the wrong diplomacy .
i believe it is influenced by the need for oil from saudi arabia .
europe does not need another islamic government . - alexius lessig , us kosovo belongs to serbia and the russian republic wo n't let the serbian province declare independence . - arthur cardoso da costa junior , brazil giving independence to what is essentially the heart of serbia is like giving a big chunk of berlin to turks or malmo to north africans or bradford to pakistanis or marseilles to the arabs .
i am sure it wo n't happen .
the serbs will not allow it to happen and europeans , as different from their supine , corrupt politicians , also do not want it . - marco borg , uk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would indepence lead to another war in the balkans ?
while they have high profile criminals in their government nothing will help people of kosovo .
it is very funny to me that europe supports these kosovo leaders .
the only outcome will be another war in the balkan region and it is only a matter of time before you will have another disasterous war in front of your " democratic " europe . - sasha malkovitch , australia may the people of kosovo enjoy independence , they have been waiting for more than 2,000 years . - adam , albania compiled by dw staff -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .
" but it 's the only way .
and the parents have to apply pressure from below . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some thought it was about time the majority muslim serbian province was set free , others thought independence would cause further instability in the balkans . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as history teaches us , european policy has caused many injuries over the centuries to small nations - for example , to albania after leaving half of that nation outside its own territory in 1913 .
the worst is that of slavic regimes , who have used a brutal way of governing minorities over the centuries by killing millions of innocent people .
this must not happen anymore and the kosovo case should be a lesson to dictators -lsb- such -rsb- as milosevic and his friends , but also to other politicians .
kosovo will be the world 's newest state . - edmond , albania i traveled through this area in 1954 and stayed in pristina for four days .
the muslims were murdering even then any christian they could catch alone .
they referred to themselves as turks .
i presume they are the leftovers of the ottoman empire .
kosovo must remain a part of serbia .
the usa was and is conducting the wrong diplomacy .
i believe it is influenced by the need for oil from saudi arabia .
europe does not need another islamic government . - alexius lessig , us kosovo belongs to serbia and the russian republic wo n't let the serbian province declare independence . - arthur cardoso da costa junior , brazil giving independence to what is essentially the heart of serbia is like giving a big chunk of berlin to turks or malmo to north africans or bradford to pakistanis or marseilles to the arabs .
i am sure it wo n't happen .
the serbs will not allow it to happen and europeans , as different from their supine , corrupt politicians , also do not want it . - marco borg , uk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would indepence lead to another war in the balkans ?
while they have high profile criminals in their government nothing will help people of kosovo .
it is very funny to me that europe supports these kosovo leaders .
the only outcome will be another war in the balkan region and it is only a matter of time before you will have another disasterous war in front of your " democratic " europe . - sasha malkovitch , australia may the people of kosovo enjoy independence , they have been waiting for more than 2,000 years . - adam , albania compiled by dw staff -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , that it had obtained a restraining order against deutsche telekom prohibiting the telecommunications giant from selling apple 's iphone in germany without a mandatory calling plan . the stylish touchscreen phone and music player went on sale this month in germany with telekom as its exclusive vendor .
deutsche telekom requires buyers to sign up to a two-year contract with its t-mobile wireless network .
the german unit of vodafone took its grievance over the iphone 's exclusive use in t-mobile 's network and the use of the device being limited to certain fees within t-mobile 's subscription offerings to a regional court in hamburg .
the court then issued the restraining order on sales which will apply until a substantive argument is brought before a court .
temporary injunctions such as the one issued against telekom can be overturned on appeal .
t-mobile confirmed the restraining order has been issued , adding that the company was examining the issue .
vodafone aim not to stop sales completely vodafone germany chief executive friedrich joussen said that vodafone was n't generally opposed to t-mobile 's exclusivity contract with apple , adding that the company did not want to halt iphone sales but wanted to have these new sales practices examined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodafone will fight the iphone in germany with the qbowl " we want it to be available to buyers without a mandatory calling plan , " he said .
" if i had wanted to halt sales , i could have , but i did n't . "
joussen said he expected a substantive ruling within two weeks .
vodafone will launch its own multifunctional handheld-computer phone , the qbowl , before christmas as a direct competitor to telekom 's iphone monopoly .
apple has stipulated that in germany , as in the united states , the iphone should be placed in the hands of the leading mobile phone operator on condition the phones are dedicated to one network and that apple gets a cut of revenues .
the iphone contains a lock which prevents it from being used on any other network .
telekom sales practice could change industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french iphone is open to other networks by law while vodafone stated it was pursuing legal action only in germany as it felt specific national rules on access to networks were being broken , the company is actually concerned that other handset makers , such as nokia or ericsson , could adopt similar strategies .
the uk-based company fears that this could restrict consumers ' choice and disrupt mobile operators ' existing revenue streams .
in france , apple recruited france telecom 's orange mobile phone subsidiary to sell the iphone .
but national laws barring the locking of phones meant the us company had to offer devices that could work on any network .
crazy for iphone the release of the iphone in europe earlier this month caused mayhem .
deutsche telekom said it had sold more than 10,000 of the heavily hyped gadgets by mid-afternoon on nov .
9 , the first day on sale .
apple said it sold 1 million in the first 74 days after the device went on sale in the united states on june 29 .

frank , a jewish girl who hid from the nazis for more than two years , mentioned the tree several times in her famous diary . after visiting the chestnut tree , the judge at the amsterdam administrative court decided on tuesday , nov .
20 to temporarily rescind permission to cut it down .
this was in response to a case brought by several groups who are against the felling of the so-called anne frank tree .
however , the judge still has the possibility to change his decision .
the 27-ton chestnut tree stands in a private garden overlooked by the achterhuis annex where the frank family hid during world war two . back on march 6 , the city of amsterdam granted the property owner permission to fell the tree in the interest of public safely .
tests undertaken by the city reveal that the chestnut , which is estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old , is diseased and several attempts to revive it have failed .
the tree 's owner wants it destroyed because under dutch law he is liable for any damage caused if it falls .
amsterdam authorities had planned to plant a tree genetically identical to the diseased chestnut in its place .

" all of this moved us so much that we could not speak . "
the anne frank foundation , which maintains the achterhuis as a museum about anne frank and the persecution of the jews , has adopted a neutral stance .
a spokesman for the foundation said that although it regrets that the tree has to be cut down , it understands that public safety comes first .
however , the dutch tree foundation and several neighbors who are opposed to felling the chestnut are appealing the decision .
they contest the authorities ' claim that 72 percent of the tree is diseased , and therefore could blow over at any time , saying that their own tests show the tree could be rescued .
a so-called administration court , which settles conflicts between citizens and administrative authorities , is to hear both sides prior to the planned felling .

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .
" but it 's the only way .
and the parents have to apply pressure from below . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

frank , a jewish girl who hid from the nazis for more than two years , mentioned the tree several times in her famous diary . after visiting the chestnut tree , the judge at the amsterdam administrative court decided on tuesday , nov .
20 to temporarily rescind permission to cut it down .
this was in response to a case brought by several groups who are against the felling of the so-called anne frank tree .
however , the judge still has the possibility to change his decision .
the 27-ton chestnut tree stands in a private garden overlooked by the achterhuis annex where the frank family hid during world war two . back on march 6 , the city of amsterdam granted the property owner permission to fell the tree in the interest of public safely .
tests undertaken by the city reveal that the chestnut , which is estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old , is diseased and several attempts to revive it have failed .
the tree 's owner wants it destroyed because under dutch law he is liable for any damage caused if it falls .
amsterdam authorities had planned to plant a tree genetically identical to the diseased chestnut in its place .
tree symbol of life outside of hiding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frank family 's hiding place is now a museum anne frank wrote in her diary on february 23 , 1944 : " we both looked up to the blue sky , the horse chestnut whose bare branches glittered with droplets , the gulls and the other birds that seemed made of silver as they swooped by .
" all of this moved us so much that we could not speak . "
the anne frank foundation , which maintains the achterhuis as a museum about anne frank and the persecution of the jews , has adopted a neutral stance .
a spokesman for the foundation said that although it regrets that the tree has to be cut down , it understands that public safety comes first .
however , the dutch tree foundation and several neighbors who are opposed to felling the chestnut are appealing the decision .
they contest the authorities ' claim that 72 percent of the tree is diseased , and therefore could blow over at any time , saying that their own tests show the tree could be rescued .
a so-called administration court , which settles conflicts between citizens and administrative authorities , is to hear both sides prior to the planned felling .
death in a concentration camp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank died at the age of fifteen in bergen belsen a total of eight jews hid in the achterhuis between 1942 and 1944 until they were betrayed in august 1944 .
the germans subsequently deported them to concentration camps , where some were killed and others succumbed following starvation and illness .
anne frank , along with her sister margot , died of typhus in bergen belsen concentration camp , in the north of germany .
otto frank , anne frank 's father , was the only survivor .
after the war , miep gies , who provided the group with basic necessities while in hiding , gave him the diary his youngest daughter anne had written during that period .
following its publication in 1947 , the diary of anne frank became one of the most famous documents recounting the nazi persecution of the jews during world war two . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

frank , a jewish girl who hid from the nazis for more than two years , mentioned the tree several times in her famous diary . after visiting the chestnut tree , the judge at the amsterdam administrative court decided on tuesday , nov .
20 to temporarily rescind permission to cut it down .
this was in response to a case brought by several groups who are against the felling of the so-called anne frank tree .
however , the judge still has the possibility to change his decision .
the 27-ton chestnut tree stands in a private garden overlooked by the achterhuis annex where the frank family hid during world war two . back on march 6 , the city of amsterdam granted the property owner permission to fell the tree in the interest of public safely .
tests undertaken by the city reveal that the chestnut , which is estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old , is diseased and several attempts to revive it have failed .
the tree 's owner wants it destroyed because under dutch law he is liable for any damage caused if it falls .
amsterdam authorities had planned to plant a tree genetically identical to the diseased chestnut in its place .
tree symbol of life outside of hiding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frank family 's hiding place is now a museum anne frank wrote in her diary on february 23 , 1944 : " we both looked up to the blue sky , the horse chestnut whose bare branches glittered with droplets , the gulls and the other birds that seemed made of silver as they swooped by .
" all of this moved us so much that we could not speak . "
the anne frank foundation , which maintains the achterhuis as a museum about anne frank and the persecution of the jews , has adopted a neutral stance .
a spokesman for the foundation said that although it regrets that the tree has to be cut down , it understands that public safety comes first .
however , the dutch tree foundation and several neighbors who are opposed to felling the chestnut are appealing the decision .
they contest the authorities ' claim that 72 percent of the tree is diseased , and therefore could blow over at any time , saying that their own tests show the tree could be rescued .
a so-called administration court , which settles conflicts between citizens and administrative authorities , is to hear both sides prior to the planned felling .
death in a concentration camp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank died at the age of fifteen in bergen belsen a total of eight jews hid in the achterhuis between 1942 and 1944 until they were betrayed in august 1944 .
the germans subsequently deported them to concentration camps , where some were killed and others succumbed following starvation and illness .
anne frank , along with her sister margot , died of typhus in bergen belsen concentration camp , in the north of germany .
otto frank , anne frank 's father , was the only survivor .
after the war , miep gies , who provided the group with basic necessities while in hiding , gave him the diary his youngest daughter anne had written during that period .
following its publication in 1947 , the diary of anne frank became one of the most famous documents recounting the nazi persecution of the jews during world war two . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , joining a week-long stoppage by rail workers . the nationwide protests , which are over issues ranging from pension reform to the cost of living , had disrupted hospitals , schools , trains , postal services and airports .
they are seen as the biggest threat to sarkozy 's planned reforms since he was elected president in may .
according to a new csa survey , sarkozy 's approval rating has fallen five points this month alone , to 51 percent .
asked if the transport strike , now in its eight day , could hurt the economy , public accounts minister eric woerth said on tuesday : " not over several days .
but if it lasted longer , it could obviously have consequences . "
" when you decide not to work , when you prevent goods from circulating in a certain way , when you prevent people from getting to places , obviously that can be a problem at some point , " woerth told france inter radio .

they voted to continue the strike they began on nov .
13 so that it overlapped with tuesday 's one-day walk out by civil servants .
opinion polls show the rail strike is unpopular with most french voters , but a majority sympathizes with the civil servants ' strike .
one-day civil servant walk-out the striking public-sector workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to cut 23,000 jobs in 2008 - half of them in education - by not replacing retiring civil servants .
some 58 percent of high-school teachers were participating in tuesday 's walk-out in paris , a union official said .
unions representing 5.2 million state employees - around a quarter of the entire workforce - also said their spending power had fallen by six percent since 2000 and were demanding pay rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air transport is also distrupted france 's postal service , la poste , said about 15 percent of its mailmen and women were on strike , while meteorologists , bank workers and hospital staff were also among those downing tools .
international flights were cancelled and delayed as air traffic control staff at some airports went on strike .
paris ' two airports reported average flight delays of around 40 minutes , and services at marseille airport , in the country 's south , have also been affected .
tuesday 's walkout is the third nationwide civil servants ' strike this year .
the 24-hour strike coincided with student protests , which disrupted classes in half of the country 's 85 universities in a campaign against a law giving faculties the right to raise money from private companies .
the french also awoke to find their newsstands empty of papers as distributors began a one-day strike over planned restructuring that is expected to lead to job losses .
striking energy workers cut 5,500 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- , or about 8.7 percent of production capacity , at edf nuclear plants earlier in the morning , the leading energy union said .
public transport in disarray state rail operator sncf has said the number of people involved in the rail strike , which affected national trains as well as paris subway and bus services , had fallen since it began last tuesday , but public transport continued to be disrupted .
bildunterschrift : the rail strike is becoming increasingly unpopular as many commuters changed from trains to cars , traffic jams stretched over more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- across france on tuesday morning .
sncf said about half its high-speed tgv trains would run on tuesday and the eurostar link with london would run normally .
talks with rail unions were due to start on wednesday .
the government has dropped its demand that the strike end before the talks get underway and instead said there simply should be a " back-to-work dynamic . "
the walk-out was over plans to increase contribution periods for the 500,000 workers - mainly in the rail and energy sectors - who enjoy " special " pension systems and can retire on full pensions as early as age 50 .
and more strikes are expected : tobacconists are due to shut up shop on wednesday to protest against new anti-smoking laws , and french judges and lawyers have planned a strike on nov .

the site dedicated to showing people 's self-made films has a breakthrough act in munich singer mina . the 14-year old has become a huge hit , not only on the video platform but also in the music charts , thanks to one clip of her singing .
now , she has an apartment in her name , a recording contract and a hit single , " how the angels fly . " the clip of mina singing attracted three million visitors and the attentions of the starwatch label which searches and promotes new talent in cooperation with german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the youngster 's music career is now well and truly off the launch pad , with no little help from magic internet , the company which runs myvideo . but the video hosting site is not looking for gratitude or royalty payments .
the fact that germany 's latest starlet sprang from the berlin-based company 's portal is thanks enough .
a talented and pretty new star is a great advert for a small firm of 20 staff which has now been catapulted into germany 's internet elite by capitalizing on the wide-reaching possibilities of web 2.0 . ideal platform for those seeking fleeting fame the basis for myvideo 's success since it was launched in march 2006 is simple .
people want to be famous .
it seems that andy warhol 's assertion that everyone will be famous for 15 minutes does n't rate highly with the new generation of self-publicists .

some thought it was about time the majority muslim serbian province was set free , others thought independence would cause further instability in the balkans . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as history teaches us , european policy has caused many injuries over the centuries to small nations - for example , to albania after leaving half of that nation outside its own territory in 1913 .
the worst is that of slavic regimes , who have used a brutal way of governing minorities over the centuries by killing millions of innocent people .
this must not happen anymore and the kosovo case should be a lesson to dictators -lsb- such -rsb- as milosevic and his friends , but also to other politicians .
kosovo will be the world 's newest state . - edmond , albania i traveled through this area in 1954 and stayed in pristina for four days .
the muslims were murdering even then any christian they could catch alone .
they referred to themselves as turks .
i presume they are the leftovers of the ottoman empire .
kosovo must remain a part of serbia .
the usa was and is conducting the wrong diplomacy .
i believe it is influenced by the need for oil from saudi arabia .
europe does not need another islamic government . - alexius lessig , us kosovo belongs to serbia and the russian republic wo n't let the serbian province declare independence . - arthur cardoso da costa junior , brazil giving independence to what is essentially the heart of serbia is like giving a big chunk of berlin to turks or malmo to north africans or bradford to pakistanis or marseilles to the arabs .
i am sure it wo n't happen .
the serbs will not allow it to happen and europeans , as different from their supine , corrupt politicians , also do not want it . - marco borg , uk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would indepence lead to another war in the balkans ?
while they have high profile criminals in their government nothing will help people of kosovo .
it is very funny to me that europe supports these kosovo leaders .
the only outcome will be another war in the balkan region and it is only a matter of time before you will have another disasterous war in front of your " democratic " europe . - sasha malkovitch , australia may the people of kosovo enjoy independence , they have been waiting for more than 2,000 years . - adam , albania compiled by dw staff -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as history teaches us , european policy has caused many injuries over the centuries to small nations - for example , to albania after leaving half of that nation outside its own territory in 1913 .
the worst is that of slavic regimes , who have used a brutal way of governing minorities over the centuries by killing millions of innocent people .
this must not happen anymore and the kosovo case should be a lesson to dictators -lsb- such -rsb- as milosevic and his friends , but also to other politicians .
kosovo will be the world 's newest state . - edmond , albania i traveled through this area in 1954 and stayed in pristina for four days .
the muslims were murdering even then any christian they could catch alone .
they referred to themselves as turks .
i presume they are the leftovers of the ottoman empire .
kosovo must remain a part of serbia .
the usa was and is conducting the wrong diplomacy .
i believe it is influenced by the need for oil from saudi arabia .
europe does not need another islamic government . - alexius lessig , us kosovo belongs to serbia and the russian republic wo n't let the serbian province declare independence . - arthur cardoso da costa junior , brazil giving independence to what is essentially the heart of serbia is like giving a big chunk of berlin to turks or malmo to north africans or bradford to pakistanis or marseilles to the arabs .
i am sure it wo n't happen .
the serbs will not allow it to happen and europeans , as different from their supine , corrupt politicians , also do not want it . - marco borg , uk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would indepence lead to another war in the balkans ?
while they have high profile criminals in their government nothing will help people of kosovo .
it is very funny to me that europe supports these kosovo leaders .

frank , a jewish girl who hid from the nazis for more than two years , mentioned the tree several times in her famous diary . after visiting the chestnut tree , the judge at the amsterdam administrative court decided on tuesday , nov .
20 to temporarily rescind permission to cut it down .
this was in response to a case brought by several groups who are against the felling of the so-called anne frank tree .
however , the judge still has the possibility to change his decision .
the 27-ton chestnut tree stands in a private garden overlooked by the achterhuis annex where the frank family hid during world war two . back on march 6 , the city of amsterdam granted the property owner permission to fell the tree in the interest of public safely .
tests undertaken by the city reveal that the chestnut , which is estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old , is diseased and several attempts to revive it have failed .
the tree 's owner wants it destroyed because under dutch law he is liable for any damage caused if it falls .
amsterdam authorities had planned to plant a tree genetically identical to the diseased chestnut in its place .
tree symbol of life outside of hiding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frank family 's hiding place is now a museum anne frank wrote in her diary on february 23 , 1944 : " we both looked up to the blue sky , the horse chestnut whose bare branches glittered with droplets , the gulls and the other birds that seemed made of silver as they swooped by .
" all of this moved us so much that we could not speak . "
the anne frank foundation , which maintains the achterhuis as a museum about anne frank and the persecution of the jews , has adopted a neutral stance .
a spokesman for the foundation said that although it regrets that the tree has to be cut down , it understands that public safety comes first .
however , the dutch tree foundation and several neighbors who are opposed to felling the chestnut are appealing the decision .
they contest the authorities ' claim that 72 percent of the tree is diseased , and therefore could blow over at any time , saying that their own tests show the tree could be rescued .
a so-called administration court , which settles conflicts between citizens and administrative authorities , is to hear both sides prior to the planned felling .
death in a concentration camp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank died at the age of fifteen in bergen belsen a total of eight jews hid in the achterhuis between 1942 and 1944 until they were betrayed in august 1944 .
the germans subsequently deported them to concentration camps , where some were killed and others succumbed following starvation and illness .
anne frank , along with her sister margot , died of typhus in bergen belsen concentration camp , in the north of germany .
otto frank , anne frank 's father , was the only survivor .
after the war , miep gies , who provided the group with basic necessities while in hiding , gave him the diary his youngest daughter anne had written during that period .
following its publication in 1947 , the diary of anne frank became one of the most famous documents recounting the nazi persecution of the jews during world war two . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , that it had obtained a restraining order against deutsche telekom prohibiting the telecommunications giant from selling apple 's iphone in germany without a mandatory calling plan . the stylish touchscreen phone and music player went on sale this month in germany with telekom as its exclusive vendor .
deutsche telekom requires buyers to sign up to a two-year contract with its t-mobile wireless network .
the german unit of vodafone took its grievance over the iphone 's exclusive use in t-mobile 's network and the use of the device being limited to certain fees within t-mobile 's subscription offerings to a regional court in hamburg .
the court then issued the restraining order on sales which will apply until a substantive argument is brought before a court .
temporary injunctions such as the one issued against telekom can be overturned on appeal .
t-mobile confirmed the restraining order has been issued , adding that the company was examining the issue .
vodafone aim not to stop sales completely vodafone germany chief executive friedrich joussen said that vodafone was n't generally opposed to t-mobile 's exclusivity contract with apple , adding that the company did not want to halt iphone sales but wanted to have these new sales practices examined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodafone will fight the iphone in germany with the qbowl " we want it to be available to buyers without a mandatory calling plan , " he said .
" if i had wanted to halt sales , i could have , but i did n't . "
joussen said he expected a substantive ruling within two weeks .
vodafone will launch its own multifunctional handheld-computer phone , the qbowl , before christmas as a direct competitor to telekom 's iphone monopoly .
apple has stipulated that in germany , as in the united states , the iphone should be placed in the hands of the leading mobile phone operator on condition the phones are dedicated to one network and that apple gets a cut of revenues .
the iphone contains a lock which prevents it from being used on any other network .
telekom sales practice could change industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french iphone is open to other networks by law while vodafone stated it was pursuing legal action only in germany as it felt specific national rules on access to networks were being broken , the company is actually concerned that other handset makers , such as nokia or ericsson , could adopt similar strategies .
the uk-based company fears that this could restrict consumers ' choice and disrupt mobile operators ' existing revenue streams .
in france , apple recruited france telecom 's orange mobile phone subsidiary to sell the iphone .
but national laws barring the locking of phones meant the us company had to offer devices that could work on any network .
crazy for iphone the release of the iphone in europe earlier this month caused mayhem .
deutsche telekom said it had sold more than 10,000 of the heavily hyped gadgets by mid-afternoon on nov .
9 , the first day on sale .
apple said it sold 1 million in the first 74 days after the device went on sale in the united states on june 29 .

19 , that it had obtained a restraining order against deutsche telekom prohibiting the telecommunications giant from selling apple 's iphone in germany without a mandatory calling plan . the stylish touchscreen phone and music player went on sale this month in germany with telekom as its exclusive vendor .
deutsche telekom requires buyers to sign up to a two-year contract with its t-mobile wireless network .
the german unit of vodafone took its grievance over the iphone 's exclusive use in t-mobile 's network and the use of the device being limited to certain fees within t-mobile 's subscription offerings to a regional court in hamburg .
the court then issued the restraining order on sales which will apply until a substantive argument is brought before a court .
temporary injunctions such as the one issued against telekom can be overturned on appeal .
t-mobile confirmed the restraining order has been issued , adding that the company was examining the issue .
vodafone aim not to stop sales completely vodafone germany chief executive friedrich joussen said that vodafone was n't generally opposed to t-mobile 's exclusivity contract with apple , adding that the company did not want to halt iphone sales but wanted to have these new sales practices examined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodafone will fight the iphone in germany with the qbowl " we want it to be available to buyers without a mandatory calling plan , " he said .
" if i had wanted to halt sales , i could have , but i did n't . "
joussen said he expected a substantive ruling within two weeks .
vodafone will launch its own multifunctional handheld-computer phone , the qbowl , before christmas as a direct competitor to telekom 's iphone monopoly .
apple has stipulated that in germany , as in the united states , the iphone should be placed in the hands of the leading mobile phone operator on condition the phones are dedicated to one network and that apple gets a cut of revenues .
the iphone contains a lock which prevents it from being used on any other network .
telekom sales practice could change industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french iphone is open to other networks by law while vodafone stated it was pursuing legal action only in germany as it felt specific national rules on access to networks were being broken , the company is actually concerned that other handset makers , such as nokia or ericsson , could adopt similar strategies .
the uk-based company fears that this could restrict consumers ' choice and disrupt mobile operators ' existing revenue streams .
in france , apple recruited france telecom 's orange mobile phone subsidiary to sell the iphone .
but national laws barring the locking of phones meant the us company had to offer devices that could work on any network .
crazy for iphone the release of the iphone in europe earlier this month caused mayhem .
deutsche telekom said it had sold more than 10,000 of the heavily hyped gadgets by mid-afternoon on nov .
9 , the first day on sale .
apple said it sold 1 million in the first 74 days after the device went on sale in the united states on june 29 .

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .

" emissions trends around the world and especially in industrialized countries are worrying , " de boer said .

representatives from more than 180 countries , together with researchers and observers , will attend the conference .
de boer set a triple benchmark to judge bali 's success .
" if there is a decision to launch negotiations , if an agenda for negotiations is agreed and if an end-date -lrb- for completing negotiations -rrb- is set , then i would consider bali to be a success , " he said .

some thought it was about time the majority muslim serbian province was set free , others thought independence would cause further instability in the balkans . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as history teaches us , european policy has caused many injuries over the centuries to small nations - for example , to albania after leaving half of that nation outside its own territory in 1913 .
the worst is that of slavic regimes , who have used a brutal way of governing minorities over the centuries by killing millions of innocent people .
this must not happen anymore and the kosovo case should be a lesson to dictators -lsb- such -rsb- as milosevic and his friends , but also to other politicians .
kosovo will be the world 's newest state . - edmond , albania i traveled through this area in 1954 and stayed in pristina for four days .
the muslims were murdering even then any christian they could catch alone .
they referred to themselves as turks .
i presume they are the leftovers of the ottoman empire .
kosovo must remain a part of serbia .
the usa was and is conducting the wrong diplomacy .
i believe it is influenced by the need for oil from saudi arabia .
europe does not need another islamic government . - alexius lessig , us kosovo belongs to serbia and the russian republic wo n't let the serbian province declare independence . - arthur cardoso da costa junior , brazil giving independence to what is essentially the heart of serbia is like giving a big chunk of berlin to turks or malmo to north africans or bradford to pakistanis or marseilles to the arabs .
i am sure it wo n't happen .
the serbs will not allow it to happen and europeans , as different from their supine , corrupt politicians , also do not want it . - marco borg , uk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would indepence lead to another war in the balkans ?
while they have high profile criminals in their government nothing will help people of kosovo .
it is very funny to me that europe supports these kosovo leaders .
the only outcome will be another war in the balkan region and it is only a matter of time before you will have another disasterous war in front of your " democratic " europe . - sasha malkovitch , australia may the people of kosovo enjoy independence , they have been waiting for more than 2,000 years . - adam , albania compiled by dw staff -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

frank , a jewish girl who hid from the nazis for more than two years , mentioned the tree several times in her famous diary . after visiting the chestnut tree , the judge at the amsterdam administrative court decided on tuesday , nov .
20 to temporarily rescind permission to cut it down .
this was in response to a case brought by several groups who are against the felling of the so-called anne frank tree .
however , the judge still has the possibility to change his decision .
the 27-ton chestnut tree stands in a private garden overlooked by the achterhuis annex where the frank family hid during world war two . back on march 6 , the city of amsterdam granted the property owner permission to fell the tree in the interest of public safely .
tests undertaken by the city reveal that the chestnut , which is estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old , is diseased and several attempts to revive it have failed .
the tree 's owner wants it destroyed because under dutch law he is liable for any damage caused if it falls .
amsterdam authorities had planned to plant a tree genetically identical to the diseased chestnut in its place .

" all of this moved us so much that we could not speak . "
the anne frank foundation , which maintains the achterhuis as a museum about anne frank and the persecution of the jews , has adopted a neutral stance .
a spokesman for the foundation said that although it regrets that the tree has to be cut down , it understands that public safety comes first .
however , the dutch tree foundation and several neighbors who are opposed to felling the chestnut are appealing the decision .
they contest the authorities ' claim that 72 percent of the tree is diseased , and therefore could blow over at any time , saying that their own tests show the tree could be rescued .
a so-called administration court , which settles conflicts between citizens and administrative authorities , is to hear both sides prior to the planned felling .

frank , a jewish girl who hid from the nazis for more than two years , mentioned the tree several times in her famous diary . after visiting the chestnut tree , the judge at the amsterdam administrative court decided on tuesday , nov .
20 to temporarily rescind permission to cut it down .
this was in response to a case brought by several groups who are against the felling of the so-called anne frank tree .
however , the judge still has the possibility to change his decision .
the 27-ton chestnut tree stands in a private garden overlooked by the achterhuis annex where the frank family hid during world war two . back on march 6 , the city of amsterdam granted the property owner permission to fell the tree in the interest of public safely .
tests undertaken by the city reveal that the chestnut , which is estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old , is diseased and several attempts to revive it have failed .
the tree 's owner wants it destroyed because under dutch law he is liable for any damage caused if it falls .
amsterdam authorities had planned to plant a tree genetically identical to the diseased chestnut in its place .
tree symbol of life outside of hiding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frank family 's hiding place is now a museum anne frank wrote in her diary on february 23 , 1944 : " we both looked up to the blue sky , the horse chestnut whose bare branches glittered with droplets , the gulls and the other birds that seemed made of silver as they swooped by .
" all of this moved us so much that we could not speak . "
the anne frank foundation , which maintains the achterhuis as a museum about anne frank and the persecution of the jews , has adopted a neutral stance .
a spokesman for the foundation said that although it regrets that the tree has to be cut down , it understands that public safety comes first .
however , the dutch tree foundation and several neighbors who are opposed to felling the chestnut are appealing the decision .
they contest the authorities ' claim that 72 percent of the tree is diseased , and therefore could blow over at any time , saying that their own tests show the tree could be rescued .
a so-called administration court , which settles conflicts between citizens and administrative authorities , is to hear both sides prior to the planned felling .

some thought it was about time the majority muslim serbian province was set free , others thought independence would cause further instability in the balkans . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as history teaches us , european policy has caused many injuries over the centuries to small nations - for example , to albania after leaving half of that nation outside its own territory in 1913 .
the worst is that of slavic regimes , who have used a brutal way of governing minorities over the centuries by killing millions of innocent people .
this must not happen anymore and the kosovo case should be a lesson to dictators -lsb- such -rsb- as milosevic and his friends , but also to other politicians .
kosovo will be the world 's newest state . - edmond , albania i traveled through this area in 1954 and stayed in pristina for four days .
the muslims were murdering even then any christian they could catch alone .
they referred to themselves as turks .
i presume they are the leftovers of the ottoman empire .
kosovo must remain a part of serbia .
the usa was and is conducting the wrong diplomacy .
i believe it is influenced by the need for oil from saudi arabia .
europe does not need another islamic government . - alexius lessig , us kosovo belongs to serbia and the russian republic wo n't let the serbian province declare independence . - arthur cardoso da costa junior , brazil giving independence to what is essentially the heart of serbia is like giving a big chunk of berlin to turks or malmo to north africans or bradford to pakistanis or marseilles to the arabs .
i am sure it wo n't happen .
the serbs will not allow it to happen and europeans , as different from their supine , corrupt politicians , also do not want it . - marco borg , uk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would indepence lead to another war in the balkans ?
while they have high profile criminals in their government nothing will help people of kosovo .
it is very funny to me that europe supports these kosovo leaders .
the only outcome will be another war in the balkan region and it is only a matter of time before you will have another disasterous war in front of your " democratic " europe . - sasha malkovitch , australia may the people of kosovo enjoy independence , they have been waiting for more than 2,000 years . - adam , albania compiled by dw staff -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it tastes the same all over but comes with different frills depending on the region .
however , some believe it should be officially recognized as a berlin speciality . those interfering europeans are at it again .
less than two weeks ago , a major diplomatic incident was avoided when the european union allowed the german specialty apfelwein to continue being known as a wine .

berlin butchers want to claim capital as currywurst 's home a group of berlin butchers have another idea and have joined together to patent the currywurst sausage .
the butchers ' objective is to " geographically " protect their culinary invention , the 1949 creation of one herta heuwer , a berliner who served her snack day and night in the western part of the then divided city .
they want the spot of her famous food stall , which was an institution at the time , to be officially recognized as the home of the currywurst .
the potential spat is still at the diplomatic level and has not yet reached the bellicose rhetoric of the apfelwein rebellion of early november .
the sausage separatists have so far followed the protocol laid down by the un savory snack council and have filed a patent request with the european patent office .

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .
" but it 's the only way .

19 , that it had obtained a restraining order against deutsche telekom prohibiting the telecommunications giant from selling apple 's iphone in germany without a mandatory calling plan . the stylish touchscreen phone and music player went on sale this month in germany with telekom as its exclusive vendor .
deutsche telekom requires buyers to sign up to a two-year contract with its t-mobile wireless network .
the german unit of vodafone took its grievance over the iphone 's exclusive use in t-mobile 's network and the use of the device being limited to certain fees within t-mobile 's subscription offerings to a regional court in hamburg .
the court then issued the restraining order on sales which will apply until a substantive argument is brought before a court .
temporary injunctions such as the one issued against telekom can be overturned on appeal .
t-mobile confirmed the restraining order has been issued , adding that the company was examining the issue .
vodafone aim not to stop sales completely vodafone germany chief executive friedrich joussen said that vodafone was n't generally opposed to t-mobile 's exclusivity contract with apple , adding that the company did not want to halt iphone sales but wanted to have these new sales practices examined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodafone will fight the iphone in germany with the qbowl " we want it to be available to buyers without a mandatory calling plan , " he said .
" if i had wanted to halt sales , i could have , but i did n't . "
joussen said he expected a substantive ruling within two weeks .
vodafone will launch its own multifunctional handheld-computer phone , the qbowl , before christmas as a direct competitor to telekom 's iphone monopoly .
apple has stipulated that in germany , as in the united states , the iphone should be placed in the hands of the leading mobile phone operator on condition the phones are dedicated to one network and that apple gets a cut of revenues .
the iphone contains a lock which prevents it from being used on any other network .
telekom sales practice could change industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french iphone is open to other networks by law while vodafone stated it was pursuing legal action only in germany as it felt specific national rules on access to networks were being broken , the company is actually concerned that other handset makers , such as nokia or ericsson , could adopt similar strategies .
the uk-based company fears that this could restrict consumers ' choice and disrupt mobile operators ' existing revenue streams .
in france , apple recruited france telecom 's orange mobile phone subsidiary to sell the iphone .
but national laws barring the locking of phones meant the us company had to offer devices that could work on any network .
crazy for iphone the release of the iphone in europe earlier this month caused mayhem .
deutsche telekom said it had sold more than 10,000 of the heavily hyped gadgets by mid-afternoon on nov .
9 , the first day on sale .
apple said it sold 1 million in the first 74 days after the device went on sale in the united states on june 29 .

opinion polls show the rail strike is unpopular with most french voters , but a majority sympathizes with the civil servants ' strike .
one-day civil servant walk-out the striking public-sector workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to cut 23,000 jobs in 2008 - half of them in education - by not replacing retiring civil servants .
some 58 percent of high-school teachers were participating in tuesday 's walk-out in paris , a union official said .
unions representing 5.2 million state employees - around a quarter of the entire workforce - also said their spending power had fallen by six percent since 2000 and were demanding pay rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air transport is also distrupted france 's postal service , la poste , said about 15 percent of its mailmen and women were on strike , while meteorologists , bank workers and hospital staff were also among those downing tools .
international flights were cancelled and delayed as air traffic control staff at some airports went on strike .
paris ' two airports reported average flight delays of around 40 minutes , and services at marseille airport , in the country 's south , have also been affected .
tuesday 's walkout is the third nationwide civil servants ' strike this year .
the 24-hour strike coincided with student protests , which disrupted classes in half of the country 's 85 universities in a campaign against a law giving faculties the right to raise money from private companies .
the french also awoke to find their newsstands empty of papers as distributors began a one-day strike over planned restructuring that is expected to lead to job losses .
striking energy workers cut 5,500 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- , or about 8.7 percent of production capacity , at edf nuclear plants earlier in the morning , the leading energy union said .
public transport in disarray state rail operator sncf has said the number of people involved in the rail strike , which affected national trains as well as paris subway and bus services , had fallen since it began last tuesday , but public transport continued to be disrupted .
bildunterschrift : the rail strike is becoming increasingly unpopular as many commuters changed from trains to cars , traffic jams stretched over more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- across france on tuesday morning .
sncf said about half its high-speed tgv trains would run on tuesday and the eurostar link with london would run normally .
talks with rail unions were due to start on wednesday .
the government has dropped its demand that the strike end before the talks get underway and instead said there simply should be a " back-to-work dynamic . "
the walk-out was over plans to increase contribution periods for the 500,000 workers - mainly in the rail and energy sectors - who enjoy " special " pension systems and can retire on full pensions as early as age 50 .

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .

now , she has an apartment in her name , a recording contract and a hit single , " how the angels fly . " the clip of mina singing attracted three million visitors and the attentions of the starwatch label which searches and promotes new talent in cooperation with german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the youngster 's music career is now well and truly off the launch pad , with no little help from magic internet , the company which runs myvideo . but the video hosting site is not looking for gratitude or royalty payments .
the fact that germany 's latest starlet sprang from the berlin-based company 's portal is thanks enough .

videos of cleaning mishaps , crazy pets , teen-angst monologues and wannabes singing in their bedrooms all share space on the portal .
more than half of those who appear are under 30 years old . it is , however , a fiercely competitive sector .
myvideo 's attraction is that it is a young and hip portal .
while this makes it popular with a certain demographic , it also leads to a creative chaos which the sector leader , youtube , keeps under control and which german challengers like clipfish and sevenload try to avoid . mina inspires myvideo to plan expansion however , if the internet free-for-all results in a mina every 18 months , myvideo would gladly accept it .

19 , that it had obtained a restraining order against deutsche telekom prohibiting the telecommunications giant from selling apple 's iphone in germany without a mandatory calling plan . the stylish touchscreen phone and music player went on sale this month in germany with telekom as its exclusive vendor .
deutsche telekom requires buyers to sign up to a two-year contract with its t-mobile wireless network .
the german unit of vodafone took its grievance over the iphone 's exclusive use in t-mobile 's network and the use of the device being limited to certain fees within t-mobile 's subscription offerings to a regional court in hamburg .
the court then issued the restraining order on sales which will apply until a substantive argument is brought before a court .
temporary injunctions such as the one issued against telekom can be overturned on appeal .
t-mobile confirmed the restraining order has been issued , adding that the company was examining the issue .
vodafone aim not to stop sales completely vodafone germany chief executive friedrich joussen said that vodafone was n't generally opposed to t-mobile 's exclusivity contract with apple , adding that the company did not want to halt iphone sales but wanted to have these new sales practices examined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodafone will fight the iphone in germany with the qbowl " we want it to be available to buyers without a mandatory calling plan , " he said .
" if i had wanted to halt sales , i could have , but i did n't . "
joussen said he expected a substantive ruling within two weeks .
vodafone will launch its own multifunctional handheld-computer phone , the qbowl , before christmas as a direct competitor to telekom 's iphone monopoly .
apple has stipulated that in germany , as in the united states , the iphone should be placed in the hands of the leading mobile phone operator on condition the phones are dedicated to one network and that apple gets a cut of revenues .
the iphone contains a lock which prevents it from being used on any other network .
telekom sales practice could change industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french iphone is open to other networks by law while vodafone stated it was pursuing legal action only in germany as it felt specific national rules on access to networks were being broken , the company is actually concerned that other handset makers , such as nokia or ericsson , could adopt similar strategies .
the uk-based company fears that this could restrict consumers ' choice and disrupt mobile operators ' existing revenue streams .
in france , apple recruited france telecom 's orange mobile phone subsidiary to sell the iphone .
but national laws barring the locking of phones meant the us company had to offer devices that could work on any network .
crazy for iphone the release of the iphone in europe earlier this month caused mayhem .
deutsche telekom said it had sold more than 10,000 of the heavily hyped gadgets by mid-afternoon on nov .
9 , the first day on sale .
apple said it sold 1 million in the first 74 days after the device went on sale in the united states on june 29 .

20 by the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- has projected that by 2012 , the industrial nations that signed and ratified the kyoto convention are on track to emit 10.8 percent less greenhouse gasses than they did in 1990 .
the european union as a whole is on track to meet its kyoto targets , but only by making use of mechanisms such as emissions trading , according to the report .
britain , france , germany and sweden are the only pre-enlargement eu-15 countries expected to meet the 2012 goal without implementing additional measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and australia are the two industrialized nations refusing to ratify kyoto the kyoto protocol commits 36 industrialized countries to a five percent reduction target from 2008 to 2012 compared to 1990 .
industrial countries ' emissions surging however , the total greenhouse gas emissions from the world 's industrialized nations has been growing since 2000 , reaching a near-record in 2005 and continuing to move upward .
reductions between 1990 and 2000 lead to an overall reduction for some kyoto signers , despite the upward swing that followed .
" greenhouse-gas emissions between 1990 and 2000 went down , but then between 2000 and 2005 they increased again , by 2.6 percent , " unfccc executive secretary yvo de boer said tuesday at a press conference held in bonn , germany 's former capital .
the unfccc blamed continued growth in western economies and a revival of growth in former east bloc nations , with pollution from transport being the biggest culprit in any sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is already wreacking havoc with entire ecosystems the united states , which is the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gases but has refused to sign the kyoto agreement , emitted 16.3 percent more greenhouse gases in 2005 than in 1990 , the report noted .
" emissions trends around the world and especially in industrialized countries are worrying , " de boer said .
kyoto to be discussed on bali the unfccc presented its emissions data findings two weeks ahead of a united nations climate conference on bali , indonesia , at which negotiations on a post-kyoto deal are expected to be launched .
representatives from more than 180 countries , together with researchers and observers , will attend the conference .
de boer set a triple benchmark to judge bali 's success .
" if there is a decision to launch negotiations , if an agenda for negotiations is agreed and if an end-date -lrb- for completing negotiations -rrb- is set , then i would consider bali to be a success , " he said .
" anything less than that would be either short of success or a failure . " dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they want the spot of her famous food stall , which was an institution at the time , to be officially recognized as the home of the currywurst .
the potential spat is still at the diplomatic level and has not yet reached the bellicose rhetoric of the apfelwein rebellion of early november .
the sausage separatists have so far followed the protocol laid down by the un savory snack council and have filed a patent request with the european patent office .

it tastes the same all over but comes with different frills depending on the region .
however , some believe it should be officially recognized as a berlin speciality . those interfering europeans are at it again .
less than two weeks ago , a major diplomatic incident was avoided when the european union allowed the german specialty apfelwein to continue being known as a wine .
it was a close call .
if the eu had pushed through with its idea to bless only those drinks made from grapes with the term , the forces of the state of hessen would have risen up and gotten really , really angry .
luckily , for everyone involved and the wider world in general , the eurocrats and the overly-protective germans called off hostilities and avoided a potentially deadly exchange of handbags .
now , however , it seems as though the eu is set on provoking further german ire by targeting the sacred currywurst .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " konnopkes imbiss " : berlin 's most famous wurst stand as a german-wide culinary phenomenon , the eu believes that the delicacy - a fried pork sausage cut into slices drowned in ketchup , curry and tomato concentrate - can be made , cooked and sold under the term anywhere in the country .

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .
" but it 's the only way .

according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates . " in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .

" in our system , you have to achieve a certain level .
if you fail , you are segregated in some way .
you have to repeat the class , or go to another school - or go to a special school , " she explained .
hausmann sees the special-education schools as " a fourth leg " of the system .
there are 10 different varieties of special school , including those for the hearing impaired , speech impaired , visually impaired , physically handicapped , learning disabled , emotionally troubled , and chronically ill , to name few .
these schools now house some 20 percent of german students overall , according to the german weekly die zeit . home-grown " apartheid " germany 's segregated schools are not only under fire from a small group of disability-rights activists .
in 2006 , the system was singled out in a scathing report on human rights breaches by vernor munoz , the un 's special rapporteur on the right to education . munoz criticized the system , saying in particular that it posed a particular danger to disabled children - as well as those from low income backgrounds and children of immigrants - by separating them from the rest of society .
herbert hüppe , commissioner for disability in the christian democrat union parliamentary faction of the bundestag , agreed .
" our current system is definitely a type of apartheid , " he said history of good will along with being a parliamentarian , hüppe is also father of a son with spina bifida .
he was able to get his son placed in a normal school in his region of unna , in north-rhine westphalia .
but it was a difficult fight , even for a parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies say everyone benefits from inclusive learning hüppe said the german special-needs schools were born of a good impulse , long ago - at a time when there was no compulsory education for the mentally handicapped at all .
" we thought we were really advanced by creating these schools .
other countries did n't have them , " he said .
" now most other countries have inclusive classes and we are the ones who are behind the times . "
his " ideal vision " for german schools is to wipe out the concept of the special school altogether .
" people think this is utopic or unrealistic , but i do n't think we can get around it , " he said .
many people continue to argue that the special schools are where handicapped students can best get their needs met .
science favors integration " but all the scientific studies show it is best for both the handicapped and non-handicapped students to attend integrated classes .
everyone benefits , " hüppe said .
he named austria , luxemburg and canada as examples of countries that have successfully adapted their school systems to include disabled children in integrated classrooms .
" we have fewer and fewer students .
we ca n't afford to keep sticking them in special schools , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handicapped kids are often kept out of sight yet contrary to this sentiment , special-needs schools in germany are fuller than ever .
from 1995 to 2002 , the number of special needs students in germany increased 10 percent .
" they are just too quick to send children to a special school these days , " said joel 's mother elke krämer . " i 'm not talking about kids who need diaper changes or whatnot .
these days if a child ca n't hop on one foot , they send him to a special school . " political solution ? yet with little political pressure behind it , a complete overhaul of germany 's divided school system appears unlikely to occur any time soon , said eva maria thoms , one of the organizers of the eine schule für alle conference in cologne .
one of the biggest barriers to change is the fact that german education policy is entirely in the hands of each state , thoms said .
the federal government habitually shrugs its shoulders when faced with demands on education policy .
still , for thoms , politics is the only answer . " integration is a human right , " thoms said .
the un convention on rights of persons with disabilities , including article 24 on inclusive education , was recognized by germany in march , but the bundestag has yet to ratify it . " they should kindly get around to doing that as soon as possible , " thoms said tartly .
when that happens , the german government would require the individual states to meet the requirements of the un convention . " that will be another fight , " she said .

germany has one of the lowest school-integration rates for handicapped children in all of europe .
critics say it is high time to make a change , but they face an uphill battle . elke krämer 's son joel was a bit slow in his physical development .
born premature , he was smaller than other children , and he took longer to learn how to walk , swim , and tie his shoes .
his kindergarten teachers recommend a special elementary school for the physically disabled .
there , krämer was told , he would get extra physical therapy that would help him catch up to his friends and allow him to switch to a regular school . now , joel is 11 , and he is still in his handicapped school - where the education level lags further and further behind the regular school .
his mother is desperate ; she has little hope he can ever change into a normal middle- or high-school . grim outlook " i was told he should go to this school for a few years of elementary school , then ' get fit ' for the regular school later on , " the 43-year-old krämer said .
" now i notice that very few children manage to do that , ever … after a while they do n't believe they belong anywhere else . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special schools , wheelchair-friendly desks krämer worries about her son 's future ; without a high-school diploma " he ca n't even get a job-training position , " she said . " sometimes i think i 'm raising a welfare recipient , " she added . the mainstreaming movement that rushed through the us and many other western education systems in the 1970s appears to have skipped germany altogether .
according to the european agency for special needs education data , just 13 percent of german special-needs children are educated in regular public schools , compared with an average in western europe of around 79 percent . germany near the bottom while it is hard to compare international statistics - each country defines handicapped and " special needs " differently - the gap between germany and the rest of europe is very real , said sybille hausmann , head of the frankfurt-based inclusive-education lobbying group gemeinsam leben , gemeinsam lernen -lrb- " living together , learning together " -rrb- . speaking at the first germany-wide conference aimed at addressing issues around integrated schooling , eine schule für alle -lrb- " a school for everyone " -rrb- , which was held in cologne in mid-november , hausmann attributed germany 's extreme situation to historical factors . " it is a big professional identity to be a special educator in germany , " she said .
" they think children have to be protected from society .
from my point of view , i think society wants to be protected from disabled children , too . " more important is that the german school system " is a very segregating system , for all children , " hausmann pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this school for the visually impaired has light-sensitive students after the fourth grade in most states , children are divided based on ability into three major types of schools that deliver different degree certificates .

the site dedicated to showing people 's self-made films has a breakthrough act in munich singer mina . the 14-year old has become a huge hit , not only on the video platform but also in the music charts , thanks to one clip of her singing .
now , she has an apartment in her name , a recording contract and a hit single , " how the angels fly . " the clip of mina singing attracted three million visitors and the attentions of the starwatch label which searches and promotes new talent in cooperation with german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the youngster 's music career is now well and truly off the launch pad , with no little help from magic internet , the company which runs myvideo . but the video hosting site is not looking for gratitude or royalty payments .
the fact that germany 's latest starlet sprang from the berlin-based company 's portal is thanks enough .
a talented and pretty new star is a great advert for a small firm of 20 staff which has now been catapulted into germany 's internet elite by capitalizing on the wide-reaching possibilities of web 2.0 . ideal platform for those seeking fleeting fame the basis for myvideo 's success since it was launched in march 2006 is simple .
people want to be famous .
it seems that andy warhol 's assertion that everyone will be famous for 15 minutes does n't rate highly with the new generation of self-publicists .
five minutes will do .
and myvideo provides the ideal platform for this fleeting flirtation with fame . " the users want to present themselves , they want the chance to become famous for five minutes " , christian vollmann , manager of magic internet said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube leads the sector but myvideo has big plans it does n't seem to matter what they do to become famous either .
videos of cleaning mishaps , crazy pets , teen-angst monologues and wannabes singing in their bedrooms all share space on the portal .
more than half of those who appear are under 30 years old . it is , however , a fiercely competitive sector .
myvideo 's attraction is that it is a young and hip portal .
while this makes it popular with a certain demographic , it also leads to a creative chaos which the sector leader , youtube , keeps under control and which german challengers like clipfish and sevenload try to avoid . mina inspires myvideo to plan expansion however , if the internet free-for-all results in a mina every 18 months , myvideo would gladly accept it .
since the youngster exploded on the scene , she has retold her story of how myvideo launched her on the world in every interview she has given .
people in the entertainment business know that you ca n't put a price on publicity like that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another mina could be hiding out there myvideo now has other plans for expansion of its name and services .
the site recently hosted the video for the new single from popular german band die fantastischen vier and has signed a cooperation deal with sony bmg to host videos from its artists . there are also plans in the pipeline to expand into other european countries , with scandinavia , the benelux countries and eastern europe the targets .
perhaps , with an extended range , myvideo can provide another mina , currently singing into her hairbrush in a romanian bedroom perhaps , with the chance to be a star . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a new csa survey , sarkozy 's approval rating has fallen five points this month alone , to 51 percent .
asked if the transport strike , now in its eight day , could hurt the economy , public accounts minister eric woerth said on tuesday : " not over several days .

one-day civil servant walk-out the striking public-sector workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to cut 23,000 jobs in 2008 - half of them in education - by not replacing retiring civil servants .
some 58 percent of high-school teachers were participating in tuesday 's walk-out in paris , a union official said .

paris ' two airports reported average flight delays of around 40 minutes , and services at marseille airport , in the country 's south , have also been affected .

the 24-hour strike coincided with student protests , which disrupted classes in half of the country 's 85 universities in a campaign against a law giving faculties the right to raise money from private companies .

20 , joining a week-long stoppage by rail workers . the nationwide protests , which are over issues ranging from pension reform to the cost of living , had disrupted hospitals , schools , trains , postal services and airports .
they are seen as the biggest threat to sarkozy 's planned reforms since he was elected president in may .
according to a new csa survey , sarkozy 's approval rating has fallen five points this month alone , to 51 percent .
asked if the transport strike , now in its eight day , could hurt the economy , public accounts minister eric woerth said on tuesday : " not over several days .
but if it lasted longer , it could obviously have consequences . "
" when you decide not to work , when you prevent goods from circulating in a certain way , when you prevent people from getting to places , obviously that can be a problem at some point , " woerth told france inter radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes are a test for sarkozy the rail workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to scrap some public sector pension rights .

13 so that it overlapped with tuesday 's one-day walk out by civil servants .
opinion polls show the rail strike is unpopular with most french voters , but a majority sympathizes with the civil servants ' strike .
one-day civil servant walk-out the striking public-sector workers oppose sarkozy 's plan to cut 23,000 jobs in 2008 - half of them in education - by not replacing retiring civil servants .
some 58 percent of high-school teachers were participating in tuesday 's walk-out in paris , a union official said .
unions representing 5.2 million state employees - around a quarter of the entire workforce - also said their spending power had fallen by six percent since 2000 and were demanding pay rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air transport is also distrupted france 's postal service , la poste , said about 15 percent of its mailmen and women were on strike , while meteorologists , bank workers and hospital staff were also among those downing tools .
international flights were cancelled and delayed as air traffic control staff at some airports went on strike .
paris ' two airports reported average flight delays of around 40 minutes , and services at marseille airport , in the country 's south , have also been affected .
tuesday 's walkout is the third nationwide civil servants ' strike this year .
the 24-hour strike coincided with student protests , which disrupted classes in half of the country 's 85 universities in a campaign against a law giving faculties the right to raise money from private companies .
the french also awoke to find their newsstands empty of papers as distributors began a one-day strike over planned restructuring that is expected to lead to job losses .
striking energy workers cut 5,500 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- , or about 8.7 percent of production capacity , at edf nuclear plants earlier in the morning , the leading energy union said .
public transport in disarray state rail operator sncf has said the number of people involved in the rail strike , which affected national trains as well as paris subway and bus services , had fallen since it began last tuesday , but public transport continued to be disrupted .
bildunterschrift : the rail strike is becoming increasingly unpopular as many commuters changed from trains to cars , traffic jams stretched over more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- across france on tuesday morning .
sncf said about half its high-speed tgv trains would run on tuesday and the eurostar link with london would run normally .
talks with rail unions were due to start on wednesday .
the government has dropped its demand that the strike end before the talks get underway and instead said there simply should be a " back-to-work dynamic . "
the walk-out was over plans to increase contribution periods for the 500,000 workers - mainly in the rail and energy sectors - who enjoy " special " pension systems and can retire on full pensions as early as age 50 .
and more strikes are expected : tobacconists are due to shut up shop on wednesday to protest against new anti-smoking laws , and french judges and lawyers have planned a strike on nov .

frank , a jewish girl who hid from the nazis for more than two years , mentioned the tree several times in her famous diary . after visiting the chestnut tree , the judge at the amsterdam administrative court decided on tuesday , nov .
20 to temporarily rescind permission to cut it down .
this was in response to a case brought by several groups who are against the felling of the so-called anne frank tree .
however , the judge still has the possibility to change his decision .
the 27-ton chestnut tree stands in a private garden overlooked by the achterhuis annex where the frank family hid during world war two . back on march 6 , the city of amsterdam granted the property owner permission to fell the tree in the interest of public safely .
tests undertaken by the city reveal that the chestnut , which is estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old , is diseased and several attempts to revive it have failed .
the tree 's owner wants it destroyed because under dutch law he is liable for any damage caused if it falls .
amsterdam authorities had planned to plant a tree genetically identical to the diseased chestnut in its place .

" all of this moved us so much that we could not speak . "
the anne frank foundation , which maintains the achterhuis as a museum about anne frank and the persecution of the jews , has adopted a neutral stance .
a spokesman for the foundation said that although it regrets that the tree has to be cut down , it understands that public safety comes first .
however , the dutch tree foundation and several neighbors who are opposed to felling the chestnut are appealing the decision .
they contest the authorities ' claim that 72 percent of the tree is diseased , and therefore could blow over at any time , saying that their own tests show the tree could be rescued .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 20.11.2007 berlin butchers join forces to protect the " home " of currywurst großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin butchers believe the currywurst was born in the capital and want the eu to agree wherever you go in germany , you can get a currywurst .
it tastes the same all over but comes with different frills depending on the region .
however , some believe it should be officially recognized as a berlin speciality . those interfering europeans are at it again .
less than two weeks ago , a major diplomatic incident was avoided when the european union allowed the german specialty apfelwein to continue being known as a wine .
it was a close call .
if the eu had pushed through with its idea to bless only those drinks made from grapes with the term , the forces of the state of hessen would have risen up and gotten really , really angry .
luckily , for everyone involved and the wider world in general , the eurocrats and the overly-protective germans called off hostilities and avoided a potentially deadly exchange of handbags .
now , however , it seems as though the eu is set on provoking further german ire by targeting the sacred currywurst .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " konnopkes imbiss " : berlin 's most famous wurst stand as a german-wide culinary phenomenon , the eu believes that the delicacy - a fried pork sausage cut into slices drowned in ketchup , curry and tomato concentrate - can be made , cooked and sold under the term anywhere in the country .
berlin butchers want to claim capital as currywurst 's home a group of berlin butchers have another idea and have joined together to patent the currywurst sausage .
the butchers ' objective is to " geographically " protect their culinary invention , the 1949 creation of one herta heuwer , a berliner who served her snack day and night in the western part of the then divided city .
they want the spot of her famous food stall , which was an institution at the time , to be officially recognized as the home of the currywurst .
the potential spat is still at the diplomatic level and has not yet reached the bellicose rhetoric of the apfelwein rebellion of early november .
the sausage separatists have so far followed the protocol laid down by the un savory snack council and have filed a patent request with the european patent office .
even if the currywurst crisis is averted on a pan-european level , there are still fears that a civil sausage war could break out between states and regions in germany .
north could make a claim against berlin patent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern german states may contest berlin 's claim northern german states and cities would be those most likely to take offense to the berlin claim should the patent be agreed .
the currywurst enjoys cult status in many areas and some believe its birthplace to be further north than the capital .
the tension is unlikely to abate any time soon .
the patent application procedure lasts between two and three years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 20.11.2007 völler , bierhoff trade insults over german soccer future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the feud is the latest in a series of verbal explosions by völler ex-national coach rudi völler and current team manager oliver bierhoff are locked in a war of words over whether germany is properly developing players - and the debate has gotten very nasty . with germany having easily qualified for the euro 2008 , one would think that everything would be hunky-dory between the national team and the bundesliga 's clubs .
think again . the conflict began with a recent suggestion by national team representatives to hold a round-table discussion to talk about the poor showing by bundesliga sides in this year 's champions league and uefa cup competitions .
one of the issues to be discussed was a perceived lack of coherent soccer philosophy among german clubs . that raised the hackles of many club coaches and managers , and völler , who 's now commercial manager at leverkusen , took out his ire on bierhoff - a former german international . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff , left , has always been more of a politician " i would suggest oliver bierhoff show a bit more humility , " said völler in an interview with the german soccer magazine kicker .
" with players who 've been trained at clubs like cologne , bayern munich , stuttgart , bremen and bayer leverkusen , you can put a philosophy into practice .
but a philosophy for a player like oliver bierhoff has yet to be invented .
you ca n't demand brazilian style if you yourself have feet from malta . " below the belt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : völler was germany 's national coach from 2000 to 2004 völler , rarely one to shy away from a good rant , continued to lambaste the germany manager . " in the next few days , oliver bierhoff should consult dr. müller-wohlfahrt -lsb- germany 's national team physician -rsb- , " völler said .
" he probably has some painful internal injuries resulting from permanently patting himself on the back . " there 's been no love lost between the suave bierhoff and the salt-of-the-earth völler since early 2002 , when then-national-coach völler stripped then-player bierhoff of his position as team captain .
bierhoff became germany 's manager in 2004 , when jürgen klinsmann took over as coach from völler . bierhoff has been quick to fire some salvos of his own .
" personally , it amazes me the way things go below the belt , if someone does n't have any arguments , " bierhoff shot back in a statement .
" this is the sort of criticism that comes out over a few beers at the pub .
i have to accept that fact , but it 's beneath my dignity . " media glee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff scored the winning goal for germany in the 1996 european championships final but the former top striker was clearly irritated by the jibe about him having feet from malta . " that 's absolute nonsense , " bierhoff huffed .
" i won the italian league with ac milan , was italy 's top goal scorer one year and am one of few players to have scored more than 100 goals . " bierhoff also scored 37 goals in 70 appearances for germany - 10 fewer than völler . the völler-bierhoff feud has completely overshadowed germany 's last euro 2008 qualifying match against wales on wednesday , nov .
21 , which is largely meaningless .

frank , a jewish girl who hid from the nazis for more than two years , mentioned the tree several times in her famous diary . after visiting the chestnut tree , the judge at the amsterdam administrative court decided on tuesday , nov .
20 to temporarily rescind permission to cut it down .
this was in response to a case brought by several groups who are against the felling of the so-called anne frank tree .
however , the judge still has the possibility to change his decision .
the 27-ton chestnut tree stands in a private garden overlooked by the achterhuis annex where the frank family hid during world war two . back on march 6 , the city of amsterdam granted the property owner permission to fell the tree in the interest of public safely .
tests undertaken by the city reveal that the chestnut , which is estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old , is diseased and several attempts to revive it have failed .
the tree 's owner wants it destroyed because under dutch law he is liable for any damage caused if it falls .
amsterdam authorities had planned to plant a tree genetically identical to the diseased chestnut in its place .
tree symbol of life outside of hiding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frank family 's hiding place is now a museum anne frank wrote in her diary on february 23 , 1944 : " we both looked up to the blue sky , the horse chestnut whose bare branches glittered with droplets , the gulls and the other birds that seemed made of silver as they swooped by .
" all of this moved us so much that we could not speak . "
the anne frank foundation , which maintains the achterhuis as a museum about anne frank and the persecution of the jews , has adopted a neutral stance .
a spokesman for the foundation said that although it regrets that the tree has to be cut down , it understands that public safety comes first .
however , the dutch tree foundation and several neighbors who are opposed to felling the chestnut are appealing the decision .
they contest the authorities ' claim that 72 percent of the tree is diseased , and therefore could blow over at any time , saying that their own tests show the tree could be rescued .
a so-called administration court , which settles conflicts between citizens and administrative authorities , is to hear both sides prior to the planned felling .
death in a concentration camp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank died at the age of fifteen in bergen belsen a total of eight jews hid in the achterhuis between 1942 and 1944 until they were betrayed in august 1944 .
the germans subsequently deported them to concentration camps , where some were killed and others succumbed following starvation and illness .
anne frank , along with her sister margot , died of typhus in bergen belsen concentration camp , in the north of germany .
otto frank , anne frank 's father , was the only survivor .
after the war , miep gies , who provided the group with basic necessities while in hiding , gave him the diary his youngest daughter anne had written during that period .
following its publication in 1947 , the diary of anne frank became one of the most famous documents recounting the nazi persecution of the jews during world war two . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 by the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- has projected that by 2012 , the industrial nations that signed and ratified the kyoto convention are on track to emit 10.8 percent less greenhouse gasses than they did in 1990 .
the european union as a whole is on track to meet its kyoto targets , but only by making use of mechanisms such as emissions trading , according to the report .
britain , france , germany and sweden are the only pre-enlargement eu-15 countries expected to meet the 2012 goal without implementing additional measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and australia are the two industrialized nations refusing to ratify kyoto the kyoto protocol commits 36 industrialized countries to a five percent reduction target from 2008 to 2012 compared to 1990 .
industrial countries ' emissions surging however , the total greenhouse gas emissions from the world 's industrialized nations has been growing since 2000 , reaching a near-record in 2005 and continuing to move upward .
reductions between 1990 and 2000 lead to an overall reduction for some kyoto signers , despite the upward swing that followed .
" greenhouse-gas emissions between 1990 and 2000 went down , but then between 2000 and 2005 they increased again , by 2.6 percent , " unfccc executive secretary yvo de boer said tuesday at a press conference held in bonn , germany 's former capital .
the unfccc blamed continued growth in western economies and a revival of growth in former east bloc nations , with pollution from transport being the biggest culprit in any sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is already wreacking havoc with entire ecosystems the united states , which is the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gases but has refused to sign the kyoto agreement , emitted 16.3 percent more greenhouse gases in 2005 than in 1990 , the report noted .
" emissions trends around the world and especially in industrialized countries are worrying , " de boer said .
kyoto to be discussed on bali the unfccc presented its emissions data findings two weeks ahead of a united nations climate conference on bali , indonesia , at which negotiations on a post-kyoto deal are expected to be launched .
representatives from more than 180 countries , together with researchers and observers , will attend the conference .
de boer set a triple benchmark to judge bali 's success .
" if there is a decision to launch negotiations , if an agenda for negotiations is agreed and if an end-date -lrb- for completing negotiations -rrb- is set , then i would consider bali to be a success , " he said .

it tastes the same all over but comes with different frills depending on the region .
however , some believe it should be officially recognized as a berlin speciality . those interfering europeans are at it again .
less than two weeks ago , a major diplomatic incident was avoided when the european union allowed the german specialty apfelwein to continue being known as a wine .
it was a close call .
if the eu had pushed through with its idea to bless only those drinks made from grapes with the term , the forces of the state of hessen would have risen up and gotten really , really angry .
luckily , for everyone involved and the wider world in general , the eurocrats and the overly-protective germans called off hostilities and avoided a potentially deadly exchange of handbags .
now , however , it seems as though the eu is set on provoking further german ire by targeting the sacred currywurst .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " konnopkes imbiss " : berlin 's most famous wurst stand as a german-wide culinary phenomenon , the eu believes that the delicacy - a fried pork sausage cut into slices drowned in ketchup , curry and tomato concentrate - can be made , cooked and sold under the term anywhere in the country .
berlin butchers want to claim capital as currywurst 's home a group of berlin butchers have another idea and have joined together to patent the currywurst sausage .
the butchers ' objective is to " geographically " protect their culinary invention , the 1949 creation of one herta heuwer , a berliner who served her snack day and night in the western part of the then divided city .
they want the spot of her famous food stall , which was an institution at the time , to be officially recognized as the home of the currywurst .
the potential spat is still at the diplomatic level and has not yet reached the bellicose rhetoric of the apfelwein rebellion of early november .
the sausage separatists have so far followed the protocol laid down by the un savory snack council and have filed a patent request with the european patent office .
even if the currywurst crisis is averted on a pan-european level , there are still fears that a civil sausage war could break out between states and regions in germany .
north could make a claim against berlin patent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern german states may contest berlin 's claim northern german states and cities would be those most likely to take offense to the berlin claim should the patent be agreed .
the currywurst enjoys cult status in many areas and some believe its birthplace to be further north than the capital .
the tension is unlikely to abate any time soon .
the patent application procedure lasts between two and three years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 2007 quotas did not go as far as some experts recommended , but they did cut the amount of cod that could be caught by between 14 % and 20 % and reduced the number of days allowed for fishing .
uk vessels landed 614,000 tonnes of sea fish -lrb- including shellfish -rrb- in 2006 , worth £ 610m - 13 % down in quantity on 2005 but 7 % up in value .
the number of young cod in the north sea has risen for a second year in a row , but the international council for the exploration of the seas -lrb- ices -rrb- warns that a 50 % cut on 2006 catch levels is needed .
uncertainty within the industry has led to a gradual decline in the number of fishermen and vessels .
most are based in england and wales -lrb- 7,116 -rrb- , with 5,205 in scotland and 613 in northern ireland .
most of the fleet is based in england and wales , but 61 % of all uk landings were caught west of scotland and in the northern north sea .
cod can take up to five or six years to reach maturity .
a large proportion is taken before they can reach breeding age .
cod can reach up to 80cm in four years , but they can be caught at 35cm long .
the minimum landing length for plaice is 27cm , but they can grow larger .
catching haddock or plaice without catching cod as a by-catch is difficult .
cod are larger , so any net with holes big enough to let cod out would let out all the other fish as well .
unwanted by-catch - that is either too small or if quotas have already been reached - is discarded and dumped back into the sea .
most die from the experience .
fish imports to the uk have increased since 2003 as exports have decreased .
the uk imports most of its fish from iceland -lrb- 98,000 tonnes -rrb- , norway -lrb- 61,000 tonnes -rrb- , denmark -lrb- 58,000 tonnes -rrb- .
key export destinations are the netherlands -lrb- 84,000 tonnes -rrb- , france -lrb- 81,000 tonnes -rrb- and spain -lrb- 42,000 tonnes -rrb- .

strict quotas have been put into place to try to rebuild depleted stocks by limiting the number of fish that vessels can bring back to port .
but are they doing the job they are supposed to ?
watch the videos below to find out why thousands of tonnes of dead fish are being thrown back into the sea and what it takes to be a fisherman in today 's climate .
fisherman 's ' immoral ' discard fisherman phil walsh sets out from hartlepool at 5am for another attempt to catch a decent haul of prawns , one of the few species not subject to a catch quota .
bbc news filmed as he pulled in fish that eventually filled 17 baskets - almost all of which had to be dumped back in the ocean .
eu fisheries commissioner joe borg agrees that discarding is " immoral " , but says the problem is how to eliminate it at the same time as having sustainable fisheries .
to see phil walsh 's haul , watch this video .
hi-tech trawler the sharp end of the modern fishing industry relies on an array of hi-tech equipment .
gps mapping systems are crucial for navigation - in harbour and at sea - while video sounders help with fish targeting , and an autopilot can act as a crucial extra pair of hands .
phil walsh gives a guided tour of his bridge in this video and explains how the different systems work together to boost his productivity .
selling the fish the daily fish market at peterhead is where trawler skippers such as david milne take their landed stock and hope it gets a good price at auction .
the market has shrunk from a decade ago , when up to 10,000 boxes would have been landed .
now half the market warehouse stands empty .
to see more - and to find out exactly why cod is such an important commodity for the scottish fishing industry - follow david as the market gets under way .

the number of young cod in the north sea has risen for a second year in a row , but the international council for the exploration of the seas -lrb- ices -rrb- warns that a 50 % cut on 2006 catch levels is needed .
uncertainty within the industry has led to a gradual decline in the number of fishermen and vessels .
most are based in england and wales -lrb- 7,116 -rrb- , with 5,205 in scotland and 613 in northern ireland .
most of the fleet is based in england and wales , but 61 % of all uk landings were caught west of scotland and in the northern north sea .
cod can take up to five or six years to reach maturity .
a large proportion is taken before they can reach breeding age .
cod can reach up to 80cm in four years , but they can be caught at 35cm long .
the minimum landing length for plaice is 27cm , but they can grow larger .
catching haddock or plaice without catching cod as a by-catch is difficult .
cod are larger , so any net with holes big enough to let cod out would let out all the other fish as well .
unwanted by-catch - that is either too small or if quotas have already been reached - is discarded and dumped back into the sea .
most die from the experience .
fish imports to the uk have increased since 2003 as exports have decreased .
the uk imports most of its fish from iceland -lrb- 98,000 tonnes -rrb- , norway -lrb- 61,000 tonnes -rrb- , denmark -lrb- 58,000 tonnes -rrb- .

the 2007 quotas did not go as far as some experts recommended , but they did cut the amount of cod that could be caught by between 14 % and 20 % and reduced the number of days allowed for fishing .
uk vessels landed 614,000 tonnes of sea fish -lrb- including shellfish -rrb- in 2006 , worth £ 610m - 13 % down in quantity on 2005 but 7 % up in value .
the number of young cod in the north sea has risen for a second year in a row , but the international council for the exploration of the seas -lrb- ices -rrb- warns that a 50 % cut on 2006 catch levels is needed .
uncertainty within the industry has led to a gradual decline in the number of fishermen and vessels .
most are based in england and wales -lrb- 7,116 -rrb- , with 5,205 in scotland and 613 in northern ireland .
most of the fleet is based in england and wales , but 61 % of all uk landings were caught west of scotland and in the northern north sea .
cod can take up to five or six years to reach maturity .
a large proportion is taken before they can reach breeding age .
cod can reach up to 80cm in four years , but they can be caught at 35cm long .
the minimum landing length for plaice is 27cm , but they can grow larger .
catching haddock or plaice without catching cod as a by-catch is difficult .
cod are larger , so any net with holes big enough to let cod out would let out all the other fish as well .
unwanted by-catch - that is either too small or if quotas have already been reached - is discarded and dumped back into the sea .
most die from the experience .
fish imports to the uk have increased since 2003 as exports have decreased .
the uk imports most of its fish from iceland -lrb- 98,000 tonnes -rrb- , norway -lrb- 61,000 tonnes -rrb- , denmark -lrb- 58,000 tonnes -rrb- .
key export destinations are the netherlands -lrb- 84,000 tonnes -rrb- , france -lrb- 81,000 tonnes -rrb- and spain -lrb- 42,000 tonnes -rrb- .

file on 4 has discovered thousands of studies have been invalidated .
it found some scientists have failed to carry out simple and inexpensive checks to ensure they are working with the right forms of human tumour cells .
cancer research uk said it used robust procedures to check the cell-lines used in research .
one of the latest examples of scientific research to be affected by this problem is a study of oesophageal cancer .
researcher dr chris tselepis worked with an international team which has found that te7 , an experimental culture of cancer cells used in labs for the past 20 years , was the wrong cancer .
whole programmes of research had to be redone using verified human brain tumour cells prof geoff pilkington , university of portsmouth " fortunately , for us our research was based on a number of cell types , so the impact of a mistaken identity for this line has actually been fairly minimal to us , " said dr tselepis who is studying the cancer at the cancer research uk laboratories in birmingham university .
" but i 'm sure there 's many other laboratories uk and worldwide-based that essentially base lots of their conclusions on one cell line and in that case , this mistaken identity has a massive impact on conclusions that people draw from such studies , " he added .
few scientists publicly admit such problems but prof geoff pilkington , of the university of portsmouth , told the bbc that he had to discard research into brain tumours after it emerged his team were studying human cells contaminated by the cells of rats and mice .
" whole programmes of research had to be redone using verified human brain tumour cells , " he said .
" it 's hugely expensive and it 's incredibly frustrating , " prof pilkington added .
erroneous data the problem is compounded by the fact that studies based on erroneous research data will be printed in reputable scientific journals and become part of the accepted literature , thus misleading future researchers .
earlier this year 19 eminent cancer specialists from the uk and usa wrote to the us health secretary urging tough action to end this waste of time , effort and money .
the us authorities replied that there appeared to be " abundant evidence " that many studies and publications had been compromised .
but the letter 's originator , prof roland nardone of the catholic university of america , told the bbc that some scientists seemed unwilling to act .
authenticated cell-lines he said the best way to get scientists to comply would be to withhold research grants and publication in scientific journals unless their research used authenticated cell-lines .
this verification can be achieved using a technique of dna profiling which compares the cell-line with a list of known contaminants and can cost as little as £ 180 per sample .
but the medical research council , the major source of public funds for such research in the uk which provides £ 70m of grants annually for cancer studies , is reluctant to enforce authentication .
dr rob buckle of the mrc told the bbc : " as soon as you start talking about regulation we have to ensure that it is proportionate and does not inhibit research . "
dr buckle said the mrc was not aware of any particular study in the uk which had been compromised by problems with cell samples .
however , one of the uk 's leading cancer medicine experts has said it is time for the scientific community to put its house in order .
cancer research uk says it carries out stringent checks on cell-lines " no grant or no publication , " said prof karol sikora , of imperial college , london .
" if one of the leading journals , which all of us want to publish in , said : ' you have used cell-line - just give us the certificate of authenticity , ' now we can tell all that and it does n't necessarily cost a lot of money . "
cancer research uk , which spends £ 315m a year on research , would not be interviewed for the programme .
instead it issued a statement from dr lilian clark , its executive director of science operations & funding , which said : " it is of paramount importance for us to ensure that all our researchers deliver world class science - they have the latest systems and robust procedures in place to guarantee this . "
dr clark said the charity carried out stringent checks on cell-lines , including a dna authenticating service .

earlier this year 19 eminent cancer specialists from the uk and usa wrote to the us health secretary urging tough action to end this waste of time , effort and money .
the us authorities replied that there appeared to be " abundant evidence " that many studies and publications had been compromised .
but the letter 's originator , prof roland nardone of the catholic university of america , told the bbc that some scientists seemed unwilling to act .
authenticated cell-lines he said the best way to get scientists to comply would be to withhold research grants and publication in scientific journals unless their research used authenticated cell-lines .
this verification can be achieved using a technique of dna profiling which compares the cell-line with a list of known contaminants and can cost as little as £ 180 per sample .

dr rob buckle of the mrc told the bbc : " as soon as you start talking about regulation we have to ensure that it is proportionate and does not inhibit research . "
dr buckle said the mrc was not aware of any particular study in the uk which had been compromised by problems with cell samples .
however , one of the uk 's leading cancer medicine experts has said it is time for the scientific community to put its house in order .
cancer research uk says it carries out stringent checks on cell-lines " no grant or no publication , " said prof karol sikora , of imperial college , london .

cancer research uk , which spends £ 315m a year on research , would not be interviewed for the programme .

file on 4 has discovered thousands of studies have been invalidated .
it found some scientists have failed to carry out simple and inexpensive checks to ensure they are working with the right forms of human tumour cells .
cancer research uk said it used robust procedures to check the cell-lines used in research .
one of the latest examples of scientific research to be affected by this problem is a study of oesophageal cancer .
researcher dr chris tselepis worked with an international team which has found that te7 , an experimental culture of cancer cells used in labs for the past 20 years , was the wrong cancer .
whole programmes of research had to be redone using verified human brain tumour cells prof geoff pilkington , university of portsmouth " fortunately , for us our research was based on a number of cell types , so the impact of a mistaken identity for this line has actually been fairly minimal to us , " said dr tselepis who is studying the cancer at the cancer research uk laboratories in birmingham university .
" but i 'm sure there 's many other laboratories uk and worldwide-based that essentially base lots of their conclusions on one cell line and in that case , this mistaken identity has a massive impact on conclusions that people draw from such studies , " he added .
few scientists publicly admit such problems but prof geoff pilkington , of the university of portsmouth , told the bbc that he had to discard research into brain tumours after it emerged his team were studying human cells contaminated by the cells of rats and mice .
" whole programmes of research had to be redone using verified human brain tumour cells , " he said .
" it 's hugely expensive and it 's incredibly frustrating , " prof pilkington added .

former workers gathered near the prime minister 's home and at the senedd in cardiff bay .
they were also staging an overnight vigil to highlight their five-year fight .
about 1,000 workers in cardiff , sheerness , kent , and belfast were hit when asw was declared bankrupt in 2002 .
the uk government has been criticised by campaigners for refusing to accept findings by parliamentary ombudsman ann abraham , who said the government was guilty of maladministration and urged that victims be compensated .
but ministers said they would not use public money for compensation . "
i was going to retire at 60 , but here i am at 61 a litter picker for cardiff council " john benson however , in february , four people who lost all or part of their company pensions won their high court case against the government .
the court ruled that the government was wrong to reject completely the ombudsman 's report into collapsed pension schemes .
the court decision does not oblige the government to compensate an estimated 85,000 people for their loss .
however , since then there have been setbacks .
in july , there was anger among the ex-steelworkers after a move to set up a " lifeboat " fund was overturned in the commons .
ministers said they were prepared to move towards providing 90 % of core entitlements for the 125,000 people affected , up from 80 % .
but the former workers from cardiff and kent said they wanted their full entitlement .
on tuesday , former workers will gather outside 10 downing street and the senedd ahead of a review by actuary andrew young to see if financial help for people who lost their pensions could be increased .
ex-asw worker john benson , 61 , from cardiff who lost the pension he had been contributing to for 38 years , will join the protest by the pensions action group , representing 125,000 workers .
" we want full compensation - 100 % of what we lost , " he said .
" we want compensation for all the stress and worry it has caused our families .
" it has taken over my life , i go to bed thinking about it , i get up thinking about it .
i wonder what have i done to deserve this .
" i 've lost my life savings through no fault of my own .
i was going to retire at 60 , but here i am at 61 a litter picker for cardiff council .
" we are not asking for much , only for what we lost .
i just hope the review will come out in our favour , " he added .

former workers gathered near the prime minister 's home and at the senedd in cardiff bay .
they were also staging an overnight vigil to highlight their five-year fight .
about 1,000 workers in cardiff , sheerness , kent , and belfast were hit when asw was declared bankrupt in 2002 .
the uk government has been criticised by campaigners for refusing to accept findings by parliamentary ombudsman ann abraham , who said the government was guilty of maladministration and urged that victims be compensated .
but ministers said they would not use public money for compensation .
i was going to retire at 60 , but here i am at 61 a litter picker for cardiff council john benson however , in february , four people who lost all or part of their company pensions won their high court case against the government .
the court ruled that the government was wrong to reject completely the ombudsman 's report into collapsed pension schemes .
the court decision does not oblige the government to compensate an estimated 85,000 people for their loss .
however , since then there have been setbacks .
in july , there was anger among the ex-steelworkers after a move to set up a " lifeboat " fund was overturned in the commons .
ministers said they were prepared to move towards providing 90 % of core entitlements for the 125,000 people affected , up from 80 % .
but the former workers from cardiff and kent said they wanted their full entitlement .
asw 's cardiff plant closed down in july 2002 on tuesday , former workers will gather outside 10 downing street and the senedd ahead of a review by actuary andrew young to see if financial help for people who lost their pensions could be increased .
ex-asw worker john benson , 61 , from cardiff who lost the pension he had been contributing to for 38 years , will join the protest by the pensions action group , representing 125,000 workers .
" we want full compensation - 100 % of what we lost , " he said .
" we want compensation for all the stress and worry it has caused our families .
" it has taken over my life , i go to bed thinking about it , i get up thinking about it .
i wonder what have i done to deserve this .
" i 've lost my life savings through no fault of my own .
i was going to retire at 60 , but here i am at 61 a litter picker for cardiff council .
" we are not asking for much , only for what we lost .

hugh roberston claims the proposals for bearsted will blight the countryside and increase road congestion .
the faversham and mid kent mp has joined thousands of local people in objecting to the plans that will see a depot built on 270 acres of farmland .
developers said the kent international gateway plan would create 3,500 jobs and remove lorries from the roads .
' extra traffic ' mr robertson , who is also shadow minister for sport & the olympics , has written to maidstone borough council as part of a public consultation which ends on 27 november .
a decision on the site , which lies to the west of junction eight of the m20 , is not expected until february at the earliest .
the mp said the plans would degrade the quality of life for local people " to an unacceptable degree " .
he also questioned the planned location of the facility .
" logic would dictate that any such facility should be situated at the end of a motorway and maidstone 's already congested motorways could not stand the extra traffic , " he said .
