when cut open , the wurst was revealed to contain a sex toy . the customer had asked the employee to store his sausage , which he intended to take back with him to dubai , in her refrigerator so it would n't go off before he flew out .
but the unusual weight of the , um , package aroused her suspicion .
she summoned the local police , who discovered that the sausage contained an unspecified device intended to give pleasure in ways foreign to the nature of a normal food product .
" the attending officers determined that the customer was attempting , in this delicate way , to conceal a sex toy , " the police wrote in their report of the incident .
hiding the sausage is one thing - hiding a sex gizmo in a sausage is another .
authorities suspect that the customer was intending to smuggle the device into dubai , where sex toys are illegal .
the customer never turned up to reclaim the wurst , or its kinky contents , and police have no grounds for pressing charges .
" that sort of thing is n't illegal in our country , " said a police spokesperson to the dpa news agency . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 . engineers from the mainly southern and eastern european nations will be allowed to work in germany from nov .
1 , if the cabinet 's decision is approved by parliament next month . the cabinet also decided that students from the new eu member states who have completed high school in germany would be allowed to work in the country . major skills crunch the measures are aimed at plugging a major skills shortage in the country which is estimated to cost germany more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- this year , according to a study commissioned by the german economics ministry last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has n't shied away from letting in workers from the new eu member states unlike countries like great britain , which opened its labor market almost immediately to nationals from the new eu member states , germany imposed a two-year work restriction on them in 2004 .
last year , the german government extended this restriction for another three years due to fears of being flooded by cheap labor . the decision was sharply criticized by german business and industry leaders who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors and warned that a thin workforce could seriously undermine the country 's economic competitiveness in the long run . the german economy , the biggest in the euro zone , is experiencing a robust recovery after years in the doldrums and companies have begun a hiring offensive . the skills crunch is especially acute in engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
experts estimate that germany currently has a shortage of 20,000 to 40,000 engineers . an annual survey published by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- pointed out that for every 100 german engineers who are about to retire , only 90 freshly qualified ones enter the market . topping german education levels a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't enough young german engineers to replace those who retire though experts welcomed the moves to ease access to the german labor market for engineers from eastern europe , some warned that it will take more to tackle the problem . carola feller of the german engineering federation , vdma , pointed out that some classical immigration countries had a much better image than germany .
german attempts to lure qualified professionals are also not especially attractive , she added . so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros - a figure that experts say is unrealistically high . " there 's a big question mark over whether it will really ease the problem , " feller said . she admitted that education levels at high schools and colleges in eastern europe are relatively good and that there are few problems with the german language since english is often the norm in the engineering sector . but feller also warned it would be difficult to top the high quality of basic engineering courses taught in germany . " if the students -lsb- from eastern europe -rsb- are fit in theoretical knowledge , if they can manage to analyze and solve problems - only then is it likely that a company will be interested in them , " feller said , adding that the average quality of engineering graduates in germany was very high . getting the best brains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say it will be difficult to top the high level of engineering courses in germany german labor minister franz müntefering said on wednesday that , in light of the glaring lack of skilled labor , the government planned to create a special commission to look into the problem and make recommendations . he also said the government was working on a points system that would in future apply to all qualified professionals interested in securing a job in germany . " those who best fulfill various criteria such as age , language , theoretical and practical qualifications will receive a permanent residence permit , " müntefering told german daily passauer neuen presse . sven renkel , spokesman for the association of german engineers , vdi , said the points system was a step in the right direction .

experts estimate that germany currently has a shortage of 20,000 to 40,000 engineers . an annual survey published by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- pointed out that for every 100 german engineers who are about to retire , only 90 freshly qualified ones enter the market . topping german education levels a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't enough young german engineers to replace those who retire though experts welcomed the moves to ease access to the german labor market for engineers from eastern europe , some warned that it will take more to tackle the problem . carola feller of the german engineering federation , vdma , pointed out that some classical immigration countries had a much better image than germany .
german attempts to lure qualified professionals are also not especially attractive , she added . so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros - a figure that experts say is unrealistically high . " there 's a big question mark over whether it will really ease the problem , " feller said . she admitted that education levels at high schools and colleges in eastern europe are relatively good and that there are few problems with the german language since english is often the norm in the engineering sector . but feller also warned it would be difficult to top the high quality of basic engineering courses taught in germany . " if the students -lsb- from eastern europe -rsb- are fit in theoretical knowledge , if they can manage to analyze and solve problems - only then is it likely that a company will be interested in them , " feller said , adding that the average quality of engineering graduates in germany was very high . getting the best brains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say it will be difficult to top the high level of engineering courses in germany german labor minister franz müntefering said on wednesday that , in light of the glaring lack of skilled labor , the government planned to create a special commission to look into the problem and make recommendations . he also said the government was working on a points system that would in future apply to all qualified professionals interested in securing a job in germany . " those who best fulfill various criteria such as age , language , theoretical and practical qualifications will receive a permanent residence permit , " müntefering told german daily passauer neuen presse . sven renkel , spokesman for the association of german engineers , vdi , said the points system was a step in the right direction . " it 's good if we can get the best brains for germany , " renkel said .

schalke lost 1-0 at home to valencia , while werder went down to 2-1 to real madrid . normally , a close loss in madrid 's santiago bernabeu stadium is a moral victory , but bremen should have had more on tuesday night against a hardly regal real .
both teams were slow out of the blocks , and the spanish giants , in particular , looked as though they were still in summer-vacation mode .
but some sloppy werder defending staked the hosts to an early lead .
in the 16th minute , ruud van nistelrooy found his unmarked strike partner raul , who headed home for the 1-0 advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real got the result without impressing bremen got a curious equalizer 60 seconds later .
striker boubacar sanogo squeezed a cross , which appeared to be deflected or mis-hit , through the arms of normally reliable real keeper iker casillas .
bremen had loads of possession in the second half but lacked precision .
van nistelrooy decided the match for real in the 74th minute after werder neglected his ominous presence in the box .
the match reinforced early-season impressions that this bremen squad is nowhere as good as the teams of the past few years .
blues in gelsenkirchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke and valencia neutralized one another in midfield schalke went into their home match against valencia with coach mirko slomka suspended and banished to the upper rows of his home ground .
so , slomka had a bird 's-eye view of his team 's disappointing performance against valencia .
the spaniards packed it in at the back , and schalke could only generate a couple of decent opportunities in the first half .
striker kevin kuranyi managed to beat the keeper on one occasion , but missed the goal by centimeters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa was the only one to score in the match david villa then put the guests on top in the 63rd minute , after schalke keeper manuel neuer ill-advisedly left his line .
the 1-0 advantage was all valencia needed - substitute peter lövenkrands blew the chance for an equalizer in the dying moments of the match .

the european commission has adopted draft legislation that would separate power generation from distribution networks .
the aim is to restrict the influence of big utility companies .
but not everyone is happy . the idea behind the proposals is to keep large energy providers from exclusive control over the supply of natural gas and electricity to the european bloc .
in part , the initiative is aimed at russia , which provides around a quarter of europe 's gas , since the proposals would ban foreign firms from owning transmission networks - unless agreements are reached between the eu and the companies ' home countries .
but the proposals would also force utility companies within the eu - for instance , germany 's e.on or electricite de france - to sell off distribution networks or hand over control to an independent operator .
and that has drawn mixed reactions .
necessary reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal is meant to give others a chance to get into the game the commission justified the proposals by saying they would boost competition and allow new operators to enter the market .
the president of germany 's association of energy consumers , aribert peters , welcomed the initiative , saying in a radio interview that it was the only way to lower prices and to ensure a level playing field .
but both germany and france would like to see their big utility companies retain more influence and are likely to try to negotiate compromises in the proposed legislation .
the energy spokesman for germany 's governing christian democratic union , joachim pfeiffer , said in a radio interview that uncoupling providers from distributors was " a completely wrong path " and that previous liberalizing reforms should be given a chance to take effect . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission has adopted draft legislation that would separate power generation from distribution networks .
the aim is to restrict the influence of big utility companies .
but not everyone is happy . the idea behind the proposals is to keep large energy providers from exclusive control over the supply of natural gas and electricity to the european bloc .
in part , the initiative is aimed at russia , which provides around a quarter of europe 's gas , since the proposals would ban foreign firms from owning transmission networks - unless agreements are reached between the eu and the companies ' home countries .
but the proposals would also force utility companies within the eu - for instance , germany 's e.on or electricite de france - to sell off distribution networks or hand over control to an independent operator .
and that has drawn mixed reactions .
necessary reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal is meant to give others a chance to get into the game the commission justified the proposals by saying they would boost competition and allow new operators to enter the market .
the president of germany 's association of energy consumers , aribert peters , welcomed the initiative , saying in a radio interview that it was the only way to lower prices and to ensure a level playing field .
but both germany and france would like to see their big utility companies retain more influence and are likely to try to negotiate compromises in the proposed legislation .
the energy spokesman for germany 's governing christian democratic union , joachim pfeiffer , said in a radio interview that uncoupling providers from distributors was " a completely wrong path " and that previous liberalizing reforms should be given a chance to take effect . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , that it proposed using untapped funds worth 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.33 billion -rrb- to plug a hole left in the 3.4 billion euro galileo project after private companies refused to pay part of the bill . " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " said european commission vice-president , jacques barrot .
" today i have come up with all the facts and figures to enable the european parliament and ministers to take the necessary decisions on the program and its funding by the end of the year . " eu ministers admitted in june that plans to secure private financing for galileo had failed , but they did not agree whether a resulting shortfall should be covered by individual eu states or the 27-nation bloc 's collective budget . the new money for galileo is to come from funds budgeted for this year and 2008 which will not be used in areas such as agriculture .
each year , several billion euros earmarked for various projects remain unspent and are returned to national coffers . eutelsat expresses interest in galileo galileo 's original financing plan recommended that public money pay for the first four satellites .
a private consortium of companies building the satellites was then to pay for two-thirds of the 26 remaining satellites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner barrot said time is running out the french satellite group eutelsat said it intended to step into the galileo project . " eutelsat is ideally suited to plan and provide the fleet of 26 satellites for galileo , " chief executive giuliano berretta told the german business daily handelsblatt on tuesday . berretta said eutelsat already implemented specific elements of galileo , for example through its europe-wide navigation system for trucks , euteltracs . " we do not want to take on a leading role in galileo , " berretta said .
" but we 're offering to play an active role in order to avoid further delays . " critics question galileo 's purpose galileo is intended to be an independent , european alternative to the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
yet while the us system , run by the defense department , is offered free of charge to businesses , galileo plans to charge its users . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's 30 satellites are supposed to form a worldwide network galileo is expected to be up and running by the end of 2012 .
but cost problems , as well as disagreements between private contractors , have stalled the project 's progress . critics have warned that the costs could keep rising and have questioned the logic of imitating the existing , free us service .

19 , that the prized apple phone would be available to german consumers starting nov .
9 and would cost 399 euros -lrb- $ 555 -rrb- .
apple fans will only be allowed to buy the gadget by using the t-mobile provider , telekom 's mobile phone subsidiary .
t-mobile will also receive distribution rights to the iphone in the netherlands and austria .
important boost to telekom the move gives telekom an important role in introducing the iphone to the european market .
according to reports , apple plans to sell around one million iphones in europe by the end of the year .
the eight-gigabyte iphone allows users to make calls , browse the internet , check e-mail and play songs and videos , all by running their fingers over touch-sensitive screen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom hopes to lure younger customers by hawking the iphone the iphone is considered an important component of telekom 's strategy to lure back younger customers .
the company recently introduced a new mobile phone brand , congstar , which deliberately avoids using telekom 's name and image as it has a reputation of being old-fashioned among young consumers .
however , consumer protection groups in germany have criticized apple 's strategy to give the iphone to just one single provider .
some have pointed out that customers of other mobile phone providers will have to change their provider to t-mobile if they want to buy the iphone and accept their existing tariffs. iphone could have tougher time in europe the much-hyped iphone had its worldwide launch in the united states in late june ahead of its hotly anticipated european launch .
the iphone has already been a hit in the us where apple has sold over one million phones .
on tuesday , apple announced that britain will become the first european nation to get the new iphone after operator o2 , owned by spain 's telefonica , won an exclusive deal with the us giant .
in france , the orange unit of france telecom is to distribute the iphone .
analysts however expect the iphone to have a tougher time breaking into the european market .
some are disappointed that the iphone to be sold in europe is identical to the one in the us which means it will be unable to take advantage of faster european wireless networks for web browsing and media downloads . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission has adopted draft legislation that would separate power generation from distribution networks .
the aim is to restrict the influence of big utility companies .
but not everyone is happy . the idea behind the proposals is to keep large energy providers from exclusive control over the supply of natural gas and electricity to the european bloc .
in part , the initiative is aimed at russia , which provides around a quarter of europe 's gas , since the proposals would ban foreign firms from owning transmission networks - unless agreements are reached between the eu and the companies ' home countries .
but the proposals would also force utility companies within the eu - for instance , germany 's e.on or electricite de france - to sell off distribution networks or hand over control to an independent operator .
and that has drawn mixed reactions .
necessary reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal is meant to give others a chance to get into the game the commission justified the proposals by saying they would boost competition and allow new operators to enter the market .
the president of germany 's association of energy consumers , aribert peters , welcomed the initiative , saying in a radio interview that it was the only way to lower prices and to ensure a level playing field .
but both germany and france would like to see their big utility companies retain more influence and are likely to try to negotiate compromises in the proposed legislation .
the energy spokesman for germany 's governing christian democratic union , joachim pfeiffer , said in a radio interview that uncoupling providers from distributors was " a completely wrong path " and that previous liberalizing reforms should be given a chance to take effect . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 19.09.2007 deutsche telekom to sell hotly-awaited iphone in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to a store in europe : apple ceo steve jobs ' iphone hoping to boost its image and appeal to younger customers , germany 's deutsche telekom on wednesday said it had sealed exclusive rights to distribute apple 's trendy new touch-screen iphone . deutsche telekom said on wednesday , sep .
19 , that the prized apple phone would be available to german consumers starting nov .
9 and would cost 399 euros -lrb- $ 555 -rrb- .
apple fans will only be allowed to buy the gadget by using the t-mobile provider , telekom 's mobile phone subsidiary .
t-mobile will also receive distribution rights to the iphone in the netherlands and austria .
important boost to telekom the move gives telekom an important role in introducing the iphone to the european market .
according to reports , apple plans to sell around one million iphones in europe by the end of the year .
the eight-gigabyte iphone allows users to make calls , browse the internet , check e-mail and play songs and videos , all by running their fingers over touch-sensitive screen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom hopes to lure younger customers by hawking the iphone the iphone is considered an important component of telekom 's strategy to lure back younger customers .
the company recently introduced a new mobile phone brand , congstar , which deliberately avoids using telekom 's name and image as it has a reputation of being old-fashioned among young consumers .
however , consumer protection groups in germany have criticized apple 's strategy to give the iphone to just one single provider .

19 , that it proposed using untapped funds worth 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.33 billion -rrb- to plug a hole left in the 3.4 billion euro galileo project after private companies refused to pay part of the bill . " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " said european commission vice-president , jacques barrot .
" today i have come up with all the facts and figures to enable the european parliament and ministers to take the necessary decisions on the program and its funding by the end of the year . " eu ministers admitted in june that plans to secure private financing for galileo had failed , but they did not agree whether a resulting shortfall should be covered by individual eu states or the 27-nation bloc 's collective budget . the new money for galileo is to come from funds budgeted for this year and 2008 which will not be used in areas such as agriculture .
each year , several billion euros earmarked for various projects remain unspent and are returned to national coffers . eutelsat expresses interest in galileo galileo 's original financing plan recommended that public money pay for the first four satellites .
a private consortium of companies building the satellites was then to pay for two-thirds of the 26 remaining satellites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner barrot said time is running out the french satellite group eutelsat said it intended to step into the galileo project . " eutelsat is ideally suited to plan and provide the fleet of 26 satellites for galileo , " chief executive giuliano berretta told the german business daily handelsblatt on tuesday . berretta said eutelsat already implemented specific elements of galileo , for example through its europe-wide navigation system for trucks , euteltracs . " we do not want to take on a leading role in galileo , " berretta said .
" but we 're offering to play an active role in order to avoid further delays . " critics question galileo 's purpose galileo is intended to be an independent , european alternative to the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
yet while the us system , run by the defense department , is offered free of charge to businesses , galileo plans to charge its users . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's 30 satellites are supposed to form a worldwide network galileo is expected to be up and running by the end of 2012 .
but cost problems , as well as disagreements between private contractors , have stalled the project 's progress . critics have warned that the costs could keep rising and have questioned the logic of imitating the existing , free us service .
at the same time , the us is updating gps , which is already used widely in cars , boats and planes . russia and china have also been working on getting similar satellite navigation projects off the ground . dw staff -lrb- sp / sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 . engineers from the mainly southern and eastern european nations will be allowed to work in germany from nov .
1 , if the cabinet 's decision is approved by parliament next month . the cabinet also decided that students from the new eu member states who have completed high school in germany would be allowed to work in the country . major skills crunch the measures are aimed at plugging a major skills shortage in the country which is estimated to cost germany more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- this year , according to a study commissioned by the german economics ministry last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has n't shied away from letting in workers from the new eu member states unlike countries like great britain , which opened its labor market almost immediately to nationals from the new eu member states , germany imposed a two-year work restriction on them in 2004 .
last year , the german government extended this restriction for another three years due to fears of being flooded by cheap labor . the decision was sharply criticized by german business and industry leaders who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors and warned that a thin workforce could seriously undermine the country 's economic competitiveness in the long run . the german economy , the biggest in the euro zone , is experiencing a robust recovery after years in the doldrums and companies have begun a hiring offensive . the skills crunch is especially acute in engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
experts estimate that germany currently has a shortage of 20,000 to 40,000 engineers . an annual survey published by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- pointed out that for every 100 german engineers who are about to retire , only 90 freshly qualified ones enter the market . topping german education levels a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't enough young german engineers to replace those who retire though experts welcomed the moves to ease access to the german labor market for engineers from eastern europe , some warned that it will take more to tackle the problem . carola feller of the german engineering federation , vdma , pointed out that some classical immigration countries had a much better image than germany .
german attempts to lure qualified professionals are also not especially attractive , she added . so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros - a figure that experts say is unrealistically high . " there 's a big question mark over whether it will really ease the problem , " feller said . she admitted that education levels at high schools and colleges in eastern europe are relatively good and that there are few problems with the german language since english is often the norm in the engineering sector . but feller also warned it would be difficult to top the high quality of basic engineering courses taught in germany . " if the students -lsb- from eastern europe -rsb- are fit in theoretical knowledge , if they can manage to analyze and solve problems - only then is it likely that a company will be interested in them , " feller said , adding that the average quality of engineering graduates in germany was very high . getting the best brains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say it will be difficult to top the high level of engineering courses in germany german labor minister franz müntefering said on wednesday that , in light of the glaring lack of skilled labor , the government planned to create a special commission to look into the problem and make recommendations . he also said the government was working on a points system that would in future apply to all qualified professionals interested in securing a job in germany . " those who best fulfill various criteria such as age , language , theoretical and practical qualifications will receive a permanent residence permit , " müntefering told german daily passauer neuen presse . sven renkel , spokesman for the association of german engineers , vdi , said the points system was a step in the right direction .

the european commission has adopted draft legislation that would separate power generation from distribution networks .
the aim is to restrict the influence of big utility companies .
but not everyone is happy . the idea behind the proposals is to keep large energy providers from exclusive control over the supply of natural gas and electricity to the european bloc .
in part , the initiative is aimed at russia , which provides around a quarter of europe 's gas , since the proposals would ban foreign firms from owning transmission networks - unless agreements are reached between the eu and the companies ' home countries .
but the proposals would also force utility companies within the eu - for instance , germany 's e.on or electricite de france - to sell off distribution networks or hand over control to an independent operator .
and that has drawn mixed reactions .
necessary reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal is meant to give others a chance to get into the game the commission justified the proposals by saying they would boost competition and allow new operators to enter the market .
the president of germany 's association of energy consumers , aribert peters , welcomed the initiative , saying in a radio interview that it was the only way to lower prices and to ensure a level playing field .
but both germany and france would like to see their big utility companies retain more influence and are likely to try to negotiate compromises in the proposed legislation .

19 . engineers from the mainly southern and eastern european nations will be allowed to work in germany from nov .
1 , if the cabinet 's decision is approved by parliament next month . the cabinet also decided that students from the new eu member states who have completed high school in germany would be allowed to work in the country . major skills crunch the measures are aimed at plugging a major skills shortage in the country which is estimated to cost germany more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- this year , according to a study commissioned by the german economics ministry last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has n't shied away from letting in workers from the new eu member states unlike countries like great britain , which opened its labor market almost immediately to nationals from the new eu member states , germany imposed a two-year work restriction on them in 2004 .
last year , the german government extended this restriction for another three years due to fears of being flooded by cheap labor . the decision was sharply criticized by german business and industry leaders who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors and warned that a thin workforce could seriously undermine the country 's economic competitiveness in the long run . the german economy , the biggest in the euro zone , is experiencing a robust recovery after years in the doldrums and companies have begun a hiring offensive . the skills crunch is especially acute in engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
experts estimate that germany currently has a shortage of 20,000 to 40,000 engineers . an annual survey published by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- pointed out that for every 100 german engineers who are about to retire , only 90 freshly qualified ones enter the market . topping german education levels a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't enough young german engineers to replace those who retire though experts welcomed the moves to ease access to the german labor market for engineers from eastern europe , some warned that it will take more to tackle the problem . carola feller of the german engineering federation , vdma , pointed out that some classical immigration countries had a much better image than germany .
german attempts to lure qualified professionals are also not especially attractive , she added . so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros - a figure that experts say is unrealistically high . " there 's a big question mark over whether it will really ease the problem , " feller said . she admitted that education levels at high schools and colleges in eastern europe are relatively good and that there are few problems with the german language since english is often the norm in the engineering sector . but feller also warned it would be difficult to top the high quality of basic engineering courses taught in germany . " if the students -lsb- from eastern europe -rsb- are fit in theoretical knowledge , if they can manage to analyze and solve problems - only then is it likely that a company will be interested in them , " feller said , adding that the average quality of engineering graduates in germany was very high . getting the best brains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say it will be difficult to top the high level of engineering courses in germany german labor minister franz müntefering said on wednesday that , in light of the glaring lack of skilled labor , the government planned to create a special commission to look into the problem and make recommendations . he also said the government was working on a points system that would in future apply to all qualified professionals interested in securing a job in germany . " those who best fulfill various criteria such as age , language , theoretical and practical qualifications will receive a permanent residence permit , " müntefering told german daily passauer neuen presse . sven renkel , spokesman for the association of german engineers , vdi , said the points system was a step in the right direction .

19 , that the prized apple phone would be available to german consumers starting nov .
9 and would cost 399 euros -lrb- $ 555 -rrb- .
apple fans will only be allowed to buy the gadget by using the t-mobile provider , telekom 's mobile phone subsidiary .
t-mobile will also receive distribution rights to the iphone in the netherlands and austria .
important boost to telekom the move gives telekom an important role in introducing the iphone to the european market .
according to reports , apple plans to sell around one million iphones in europe by the end of the year .
the eight-gigabyte iphone allows users to make calls , browse the internet , check e-mail and play songs and videos , all by running their fingers over touch-sensitive screen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom hopes to lure younger customers by hawking the iphone the iphone is considered an important component of telekom 's strategy to lure back younger customers .
the company recently introduced a new mobile phone brand , congstar , which deliberately avoids using telekom 's name and image as it has a reputation of being old-fashioned among young consumers .
however , consumer protection groups in germany have criticized apple 's strategy to give the iphone to just one single provider .
some have pointed out that customers of other mobile phone providers will have to change their provider to t-mobile if they want to buy the iphone and accept their existing tariffs. iphone could have tougher time in europe the much-hyped iphone had its worldwide launch in the united states in late june ahead of its hotly anticipated european launch .
the iphone has already been a hit in the us where apple has sold over one million phones .
on tuesday , apple announced that britain will become the first european nation to get the new iphone after operator o2 , owned by spain 's telefonica , won an exclusive deal with the us giant .
in france , the orange unit of france telecom is to distribute the iphone .
analysts however expect the iphone to have a tougher time breaking into the european market .
some are disappointed that the iphone to be sold in europe is identical to the one in the us which means it will be unable to take advantage of faster european wireless networks for web browsing and media downloads . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission has adopted draft legislation that would separate power generation from distribution networks .
the aim is to restrict the influence of big utility companies .
but not everyone is happy . the idea behind the proposals is to keep large energy providers from exclusive control over the supply of natural gas and electricity to the european bloc .
in part , the initiative is aimed at russia , which provides around a quarter of europe 's gas , since the proposals would ban foreign firms from owning transmission networks - unless agreements are reached between the eu and the companies ' home countries .
but the proposals would also force utility companies within the eu - for instance , germany 's e.on or electricite de france - to sell off distribution networks or hand over control to an independent operator .
and that has drawn mixed reactions .
necessary reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal is meant to give others a chance to get into the game the commission justified the proposals by saying they would boost competition and allow new operators to enter the market .
the president of germany 's association of energy consumers , aribert peters , welcomed the initiative , saying in a radio interview that it was the only way to lower prices and to ensure a level playing field .
but both germany and france would like to see their big utility companies retain more influence and are likely to try to negotiate compromises in the proposed legislation .
the energy spokesman for germany 's governing christian democratic union , joachim pfeiffer , said in a radio interview that uncoupling providers from distributors was " a completely wrong path " and that previous liberalizing reforms should be given a chance to take effect . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission has adopted draft legislation that would separate power generation from distribution networks .
the aim is to restrict the influence of big utility companies .
but not everyone is happy . the idea behind the proposals is to keep large energy providers from exclusive control over the supply of natural gas and electricity to the european bloc .
in part , the initiative is aimed at russia , which provides around a quarter of europe 's gas , since the proposals would ban foreign firms from owning transmission networks - unless agreements are reached between the eu and the companies ' home countries .
but the proposals would also force utility companies within the eu - for instance , germany 's e.on or electricite de france - to sell off distribution networks or hand over control to an independent operator .
and that has drawn mixed reactions .
necessary reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal is meant to give others a chance to get into the game the commission justified the proposals by saying they would boost competition and allow new operators to enter the market .
the president of germany 's association of energy consumers , aribert peters , welcomed the initiative , saying in a radio interview that it was the only way to lower prices and to ensure a level playing field .
but both germany and france would like to see their big utility companies retain more influence and are likely to try to negotiate compromises in the proposed legislation .
the energy spokesman for germany 's governing christian democratic union , joachim pfeiffer , said in a radio interview that uncoupling providers from distributors was " a completely wrong path " and that previous liberalizing reforms should be given a chance to take effect . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission has adopted draft legislation that would separate power generation from distribution networks .
the aim is to restrict the influence of big utility companies .
but not everyone is happy . the idea behind the proposals is to keep large energy providers from exclusive control over the supply of natural gas and electricity to the european bloc .
in part , the initiative is aimed at russia , which provides around a quarter of europe 's gas , since the proposals would ban foreign firms from owning transmission networks - unless agreements are reached between the eu and the companies ' home countries .
but the proposals would also force utility companies within the eu - for instance , germany 's e.on or electricite de france - to sell off distribution networks or hand over control to an independent operator .
and that has drawn mixed reactions .
necessary reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal is meant to give others a chance to get into the game the commission justified the proposals by saying they would boost competition and allow new operators to enter the market .
the president of germany 's association of energy consumers , aribert peters , welcomed the initiative , saying in a radio interview that it was the only way to lower prices and to ensure a level playing field .
but both germany and france would like to see their big utility companies retain more influence and are likely to try to negotiate compromises in the proposed legislation .
the energy spokesman for germany 's governing christian democratic union , joachim pfeiffer , said in a radio interview that uncoupling providers from distributors was " a completely wrong path " and that previous liberalizing reforms should be given a chance to take effect . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , that the prized apple phone would be available to german consumers starting nov .
9 and would cost 399 euros -lrb- $ 555 -rrb- .
apple fans will only be allowed to buy the gadget by using the t-mobile provider , telekom 's mobile phone subsidiary .
t-mobile will also receive distribution rights to the iphone in the netherlands and austria .
important boost to telekom the move gives telekom an important role in introducing the iphone to the european market .
according to reports , apple plans to sell around one million iphones in europe by the end of the year .
the eight-gigabyte iphone allows users to make calls , browse the internet , check e-mail and play songs and videos , all by running their fingers over touch-sensitive screen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom hopes to lure younger customers by hawking the iphone the iphone is considered an important component of telekom 's strategy to lure back younger customers .
the company recently introduced a new mobile phone brand , congstar , which deliberately avoids using telekom 's name and image as it has a reputation of being old-fashioned among young consumers .
however , consumer protection groups in germany have criticized apple 's strategy to give the iphone to just one single provider .
some have pointed out that customers of other mobile phone providers will have to change their provider to t-mobile if they want to buy the iphone and accept their existing tariffs. iphone could have tougher time in europe the much-hyped iphone had its worldwide launch in the united states in late june ahead of its hotly anticipated european launch .
the iphone has already been a hit in the us where apple has sold over one million phones .
on tuesday , apple announced that britain will become the first european nation to get the new iphone after operator o2 , owned by spain 's telefonica , won an exclusive deal with the us giant .
in france , the orange unit of france telecom is to distribute the iphone .
analysts however expect the iphone to have a tougher time breaking into the european market .
some are disappointed that the iphone to be sold in europe is identical to the one in the us which means it will be unable to take advantage of faster european wireless networks for web browsing and media downloads . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 . engineers from the mainly southern and eastern european nations will be allowed to work in germany from nov .
1 , if the cabinet 's decision is approved by parliament next month . the cabinet also decided that students from the new eu member states who have completed high school in germany would be allowed to work in the country . major skills crunch the measures are aimed at plugging a major skills shortage in the country which is estimated to cost germany more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- this year , according to a study commissioned by the german economics ministry last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has n't shied away from letting in workers from the new eu member states unlike countries like great britain , which opened its labor market almost immediately to nationals from the new eu member states , germany imposed a two-year work restriction on them in 2004 .
last year , the german government extended this restriction for another three years due to fears of being flooded by cheap labor . the decision was sharply criticized by german business and industry leaders who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors and warned that a thin workforce could seriously undermine the country 's economic competitiveness in the long run . the german economy , the biggest in the euro zone , is experiencing a robust recovery after years in the doldrums and companies have begun a hiring offensive . the skills crunch is especially acute in engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
experts estimate that germany currently has a shortage of 20,000 to 40,000 engineers . an annual survey published by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- pointed out that for every 100 german engineers who are about to retire , only 90 freshly qualified ones enter the market . topping german education levels a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't enough young german engineers to replace those who retire though experts welcomed the moves to ease access to the german labor market for engineers from eastern europe , some warned that it will take more to tackle the problem . carola feller of the german engineering federation , vdma , pointed out that some classical immigration countries had a much better image than germany .
german attempts to lure qualified professionals are also not especially attractive , she added . so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros - a figure that experts say is unrealistically high . " there 's a big question mark over whether it will really ease the problem , " feller said . she admitted that education levels at high schools and colleges in eastern europe are relatively good and that there are few problems with the german language since english is often the norm in the engineering sector . but feller also warned it would be difficult to top the high quality of basic engineering courses taught in germany . " if the students -lsb- from eastern europe -rsb- are fit in theoretical knowledge , if they can manage to analyze and solve problems - only then is it likely that a company will be interested in them , " feller said , adding that the average quality of engineering graduates in germany was very high . getting the best brains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say it will be difficult to top the high level of engineering courses in germany german labor minister franz müntefering said on wednesday that , in light of the glaring lack of skilled labor , the government planned to create a special commission to look into the problem and make recommendations . he also said the government was working on a points system that would in future apply to all qualified professionals interested in securing a job in germany . " those who best fulfill various criteria such as age , language , theoretical and practical qualifications will receive a permanent residence permit , " müntefering told german daily passauer neuen presse . sven renkel , spokesman for the association of german engineers , vdi , said the points system was a step in the right direction . " it 's good if we can get the best brains for germany , " renkel said .

19 . engineers from the mainly southern and eastern european nations will be allowed to work in germany from nov .
1 , if the cabinet 's decision is approved by parliament next month . the cabinet also decided that students from the new eu member states who have completed high school in germany would be allowed to work in the country . major skills crunch the measures are aimed at plugging a major skills shortage in the country which is estimated to cost germany more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- this year , according to a study commissioned by the german economics ministry last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has n't shied away from letting in workers from the new eu member states unlike countries like great britain , which opened its labor market almost immediately to nationals from the new eu member states , germany imposed a two-year work restriction on them in 2004 .
last year , the german government extended this restriction for another three years due to fears of being flooded by cheap labor . the decision was sharply criticized by german business and industry leaders who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors and warned that a thin workforce could seriously undermine the country 's economic competitiveness in the long run . the german economy , the biggest in the euro zone , is experiencing a robust recovery after years in the doldrums and companies have begun a hiring offensive . the skills crunch is especially acute in engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
experts estimate that germany currently has a shortage of 20,000 to 40,000 engineers . an annual survey published by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- pointed out that for every 100 german engineers who are about to retire , only 90 freshly qualified ones enter the market . topping german education levels a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't enough young german engineers to replace those who retire though experts welcomed the moves to ease access to the german labor market for engineers from eastern europe , some warned that it will take more to tackle the problem . carola feller of the german engineering federation , vdma , pointed out that some classical immigration countries had a much better image than germany .
german attempts to lure qualified professionals are also not especially attractive , she added . so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros - a figure that experts say is unrealistically high . " there 's a big question mark over whether it will really ease the problem , " feller said . she admitted that education levels at high schools and colleges in eastern europe are relatively good and that there are few problems with the german language since english is often the norm in the engineering sector . but feller also warned it would be difficult to top the high quality of basic engineering courses taught in germany . " if the students -lsb- from eastern europe -rsb- are fit in theoretical knowledge , if they can manage to analyze and solve problems - only then is it likely that a company will be interested in them , " feller said , adding that the average quality of engineering graduates in germany was very high . getting the best brains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say it will be difficult to top the high level of engineering courses in germany german labor minister franz müntefering said on wednesday that , in light of the glaring lack of skilled labor , the government planned to create a special commission to look into the problem and make recommendations . he also said the government was working on a points system that would in future apply to all qualified professionals interested in securing a job in germany . " those who best fulfill various criteria such as age , language , theoretical and practical qualifications will receive a permanent residence permit , " müntefering told german daily passauer neuen presse . sven renkel , spokesman for the association of german engineers , vdi , said the points system was a step in the right direction .

schalke lost 1-0 at home to valencia , while werder went down to 2-1 to real madrid . normally , a close loss in madrid 's santiago bernabeu stadium is a moral victory , but bremen should have had more on tuesday night against a hardly regal real .
both teams were slow out of the blocks , and the spanish giants , in particular , looked as though they were still in summer-vacation mode .
but some sloppy werder defending staked the hosts to an early lead .
in the 16th minute , ruud van nistelrooy found his unmarked strike partner raul , who headed home for the 1-0 advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real got the result without impressing bremen got a curious equalizer 60 seconds later .
striker boubacar sanogo squeezed a cross , which appeared to be deflected or mis-hit , through the arms of normally reliable real keeper iker casillas .
bremen had loads of possession in the second half but lacked precision .
van nistelrooy decided the match for real in the 74th minute after werder neglected his ominous presence in the box .
the match reinforced early-season impressions that this bremen squad is nowhere as good as the teams of the past few years .
blues in gelsenkirchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke and valencia neutralized one another in midfield schalke went into their home match against valencia with coach mirko slomka suspended and banished to the upper rows of his home ground .
so , slomka had a bird 's-eye view of his team 's disappointing performance against valencia .
the spaniards packed it in at the back , and schalke could only generate a couple of decent opportunities in the first half .
striker kevin kuranyi managed to beat the keeper on one occasion , but missed the goal by centimeters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa was the only one to score in the match david villa then put the guests on top in the 63rd minute , after schalke keeper manuel neuer ill-advisedly left his line .
the 1-0 advantage was all valencia needed - substitute peter lövenkrands blew the chance for an equalizer in the dying moments of the match .

when cut open , the wurst was revealed to contain a sex toy . the customer had asked the employee to store his sausage , which he intended to take back with him to dubai , in her refrigerator so it would n't go off before he flew out .
but the unusual weight of the , um , package aroused her suspicion .
she summoned the local police , who discovered that the sausage contained an unspecified device intended to give pleasure in ways foreign to the nature of a normal food product .

hiding the sausage is one thing - hiding a sex gizmo in a sausage is another .

when cut open , the wurst was revealed to contain a sex toy . the customer had asked the employee to store his sausage , which he intended to take back with him to dubai , in her refrigerator so it would n't go off before he flew out .
but the unusual weight of the , um , package aroused her suspicion .
she summoned the local police , who discovered that the sausage contained an unspecified device intended to give pleasure in ways foreign to the nature of a normal food product .

hiding the sausage is one thing - hiding a sex gizmo in a sausage is another .

schalke lost 1-0 at home to valencia , while werder went down to 2-1 to real madrid . normally , a close loss in madrid 's santiago bernabeu stadium is a moral victory , but bremen should have had more on tuesday night against a hardly regal real .
both teams were slow out of the blocks , and the spanish giants , in particular , looked as though they were still in summer-vacation mode .
but some sloppy werder defending staked the hosts to an early lead .

bremen had loads of possession in the second half but lacked precision .

schalke lost 1-0 at home to valencia , while werder went down to 2-1 to real madrid . normally , a close loss in madrid 's santiago bernabeu stadium is a moral victory , but bremen should have had more on tuesday night against a hardly regal real .
both teams were slow out of the blocks , and the spanish giants , in particular , looked as though they were still in summer-vacation mode .
but some sloppy werder defending staked the hosts to an early lead .
in the 16th minute , ruud van nistelrooy found his unmarked strike partner raul , who headed home for the 1-0 advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real got the result without impressing bremen got a curious equalizer 60 seconds later .
striker boubacar sanogo squeezed a cross , which appeared to be deflected or mis-hit , through the arms of normally reliable real keeper iker casillas .
bremen had loads of possession in the second half but lacked precision .
van nistelrooy decided the match for real in the 74th minute after werder neglected his ominous presence in the box .
the match reinforced early-season impressions that this bremen squad is nowhere as good as the teams of the past few years .

the spaniards packed it in at the back , and schalke could only generate a couple of decent opportunities in the first half .
striker kevin kuranyi managed to beat the keeper on one occasion , but missed the goal by centimeters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa was the only one to score in the match david villa then put the guests on top in the 63rd minute , after schalke keeper manuel neuer ill-advisedly left his line .
the 1-0 advantage was all valencia needed - substitute peter lövenkrands blew the chance for an equalizer in the dying moments of the match .

schalke lost 1-0 at home to valencia , while werder went down to 2-1 to real madrid . normally , a close loss in madrid 's santiago bernabeu stadium is a moral victory , but bremen should have had more on tuesday night against a hardly regal real .
both teams were slow out of the blocks , and the spanish giants , in particular , looked as though they were still in summer-vacation mode .
but some sloppy werder defending staked the hosts to an early lead .
in the 16th minute , ruud van nistelrooy found his unmarked strike partner raul , who headed home for the 1-0 advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real got the result without impressing bremen got a curious equalizer 60 seconds later .
striker boubacar sanogo squeezed a cross , which appeared to be deflected or mis-hit , through the arms of normally reliable real keeper iker casillas .
bremen had loads of possession in the second half but lacked precision .
van nistelrooy decided the match for real in the 74th minute after werder neglected his ominous presence in the box .
the match reinforced early-season impressions that this bremen squad is nowhere as good as the teams of the past few years .
blues in gelsenkirchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke and valencia neutralized one another in midfield schalke went into their home match against valencia with coach mirko slomka suspended and banished to the upper rows of his home ground .
so , slomka had a bird 's-eye view of his team 's disappointing performance against valencia .
the spaniards packed it in at the back , and schalke could only generate a couple of decent opportunities in the first half .
striker kevin kuranyi managed to beat the keeper on one occasion , but missed the goal by centimeters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa was the only one to score in the match david villa then put the guests on top in the 63rd minute , after schalke keeper manuel neuer ill-advisedly left his line .
the 1-0 advantage was all valencia needed - substitute peter lövenkrands blew the chance for an equalizer in the dying moments of the match .

the european commission has adopted draft legislation that would separate power generation from distribution networks .
the aim is to restrict the influence of big utility companies .
but not everyone is happy . the idea behind the proposals is to keep large energy providers from exclusive control over the supply of natural gas and electricity to the european bloc .
in part , the initiative is aimed at russia , which provides around a quarter of europe 's gas , since the proposals would ban foreign firms from owning transmission networks - unless agreements are reached between the eu and the companies ' home countries .
but the proposals would also force utility companies within the eu - for instance , germany 's e.on or electricite de france - to sell off distribution networks or hand over control to an independent operator .
and that has drawn mixed reactions .
necessary reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal is meant to give others a chance to get into the game the commission justified the proposals by saying they would boost competition and allow new operators to enter the market .
the president of germany 's association of energy consumers , aribert peters , welcomed the initiative , saying in a radio interview that it was the only way to lower prices and to ensure a level playing field .
but both germany and france would like to see their big utility companies retain more influence and are likely to try to negotiate compromises in the proposed legislation .
the energy spokesman for germany 's governing christian democratic union , joachim pfeiffer , said in a radio interview that uncoupling providers from distributors was " a completely wrong path " and that previous liberalizing reforms should be given a chance to take effect . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission has adopted draft legislation that would separate power generation from distribution networks .
the aim is to restrict the influence of big utility companies .
but not everyone is happy . the idea behind the proposals is to keep large energy providers from exclusive control over the supply of natural gas and electricity to the european bloc .
in part , the initiative is aimed at russia , which provides around a quarter of europe 's gas , since the proposals would ban foreign firms from owning transmission networks - unless agreements are reached between the eu and the companies ' home countries .
but the proposals would also force utility companies within the eu - for instance , germany 's e.on or electricite de france - to sell off distribution networks or hand over control to an independent operator .
and that has drawn mixed reactions .
necessary reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal is meant to give others a chance to get into the game the commission justified the proposals by saying they would boost competition and allow new operators to enter the market .
the president of germany 's association of energy consumers , aribert peters , welcomed the initiative , saying in a radio interview that it was the only way to lower prices and to ensure a level playing field .
but both germany and france would like to see their big utility companies retain more influence and are likely to try to negotiate compromises in the proposed legislation .

the aim is to restrict the influence of big utility companies .
but not everyone is happy . the idea behind the proposals is to keep large energy providers from exclusive control over the supply of natural gas and electricity to the european bloc .
in part , the initiative is aimed at russia , which provides around a quarter of europe 's gas , since the proposals would ban foreign firms from owning transmission networks - unless agreements are reached between the eu and the companies ' home countries .
but the proposals would also force utility companies within the eu - for instance , germany 's e.on or electricite de france - to sell off distribution networks or hand over control to an independent operator .
and that has drawn mixed reactions .
necessary reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal is meant to give others a chance to get into the game the commission justified the proposals by saying they would boost competition and allow new operators to enter the market .
the president of germany 's association of energy consumers , aribert peters , welcomed the initiative , saying in a radio interview that it was the only way to lower prices and to ensure a level playing field .
but both germany and france would like to see their big utility companies retain more influence and are likely to try to negotiate compromises in the proposed legislation .
the energy spokesman for germany 's governing christian democratic union , joachim pfeiffer , said in a radio interview that uncoupling providers from distributors was " a completely wrong path " and that previous liberalizing reforms should be given a chance to take effect . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when cut open , the wurst was revealed to contain a sex toy . the customer had asked the employee to store his sausage , which he intended to take back with him to dubai , in her refrigerator so it would n't go off before he flew out .
but the unusual weight of the , um , package aroused her suspicion .
she summoned the local police , who discovered that the sausage contained an unspecified device intended to give pleasure in ways foreign to the nature of a normal food product .
" the attending officers determined that the customer was attempting , in this delicate way , to conceal a sex toy , " the police wrote in their report of the incident .
hiding the sausage is one thing - hiding a sex gizmo in a sausage is another .
authorities suspect that the customer was intending to smuggle the device into dubai , where sex toys are illegal .

the european commission has adopted draft legislation that would separate power generation from distribution networks .
the aim is to restrict the influence of big utility companies .
but not everyone is happy . the idea behind the proposals is to keep large energy providers from exclusive control over the supply of natural gas and electricity to the european bloc .
in part , the initiative is aimed at russia , which provides around a quarter of europe 's gas , since the proposals would ban foreign firms from owning transmission networks - unless agreements are reached between the eu and the companies ' home countries .
but the proposals would also force utility companies within the eu - for instance , germany 's e.on or electricite de france - to sell off distribution networks or hand over control to an independent operator .
and that has drawn mixed reactions .
necessary reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal is meant to give others a chance to get into the game the commission justified the proposals by saying they would boost competition and allow new operators to enter the market .
the president of germany 's association of energy consumers , aribert peters , welcomed the initiative , saying in a radio interview that it was the only way to lower prices and to ensure a level playing field .
but both germany and france would like to see their big utility companies retain more influence and are likely to try to negotiate compromises in the proposed legislation .
the energy spokesman for germany 's governing christian democratic union , joachim pfeiffer , said in a radio interview that uncoupling providers from distributors was " a completely wrong path " and that previous liberalizing reforms should be given a chance to take effect . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schalke lost 1-0 at home to valencia , while werder went down to 2-1 to real madrid . normally , a close loss in madrid 's santiago bernabeu stadium is a moral victory , but bremen should have had more on tuesday night against a hardly regal real .
both teams were slow out of the blocks , and the spanish giants , in particular , looked as though they were still in summer-vacation mode .
but some sloppy werder defending staked the hosts to an early lead .
in the 16th minute , ruud van nistelrooy found his unmarked strike partner raul , who headed home for the 1-0 advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real got the result without impressing bremen got a curious equalizer 60 seconds later .
striker boubacar sanogo squeezed a cross , which appeared to be deflected or mis-hit , through the arms of normally reliable real keeper iker casillas .
bremen had loads of possession in the second half but lacked precision .
van nistelrooy decided the match for real in the 74th minute after werder neglected his ominous presence in the box .
the match reinforced early-season impressions that this bremen squad is nowhere as good as the teams of the past few years .

so , slomka had a bird 's-eye view of his team 's disappointing performance against valencia .
the spaniards packed it in at the back , and schalke could only generate a couple of decent opportunities in the first half .
striker kevin kuranyi managed to beat the keeper on one occasion , but missed the goal by centimeters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa was the only one to score in the match david villa then put the guests on top in the 63rd minute , after schalke keeper manuel neuer ill-advisedly left his line .
the 1-0 advantage was all valencia needed - substitute peter lövenkrands blew the chance for an equalizer in the dying moments of the match .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 19.09.2007 germany to open job market to eastern european engineers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : engineering in germany is often lonely work the german cabinet has approved plans to plug a shortage of skilled labor by relaxing work restrictions on engineers from new eu member states as well as lowering barriers for foreign students to work in germany . the measures would apply to electrical and mechanical engineers from the 10 nations that joined the european union in 2004 , the german labor ministry said in a statement on wednesday , sept .
19 . engineers from the mainly southern and eastern european nations will be allowed to work in germany from nov .
1 , if the cabinet 's decision is approved by parliament next month . the cabinet also decided that students from the new eu member states who have completed high school in germany would be allowed to work in the country . major skills crunch the measures are aimed at plugging a major skills shortage in the country which is estimated to cost germany more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- this year , according to a study commissioned by the german economics ministry last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has n't shied away from letting in workers from the new eu member states unlike countries like great britain , which opened its labor market almost immediately to nationals from the new eu member states , germany imposed a two-year work restriction on them in 2004 .
last year , the german government extended this restriction for another three years due to fears of being flooded by cheap labor . the decision was sharply criticized by german business and industry leaders who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors and warned that a thin workforce could seriously undermine the country 's economic competitiveness in the long run . the german economy , the biggest in the euro zone , is experiencing a robust recovery after years in the doldrums and companies have begun a hiring offensive . the skills crunch is especially acute in engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
experts estimate that germany currently has a shortage of 20,000 to 40,000 engineers . an annual survey published by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- pointed out that for every 100 german engineers who are about to retire , only 90 freshly qualified ones enter the market . topping german education levels a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't enough young german engineers to replace those who retire though experts welcomed the moves to ease access to the german labor market for engineers from eastern europe , some warned that it will take more to tackle the problem . carola feller of the german engineering federation , vdma , pointed out that some classical immigration countries had a much better image than germany .
german attempts to lure qualified professionals are also not especially attractive , she added . so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros - a figure that experts say is unrealistically high . " there 's a big question mark over whether it will really ease the problem , " feller said . she admitted that education levels at high schools and colleges in eastern europe are relatively good and that there are few problems with the german language since english is often the norm in the engineering sector . but feller also warned it would be difficult to top the high quality of basic engineering courses taught in germany . " if the students -lsb- from eastern europe -rsb- are fit in theoretical knowledge , if they can manage to analyze and solve problems - only then is it likely that a company will be interested in them , " feller said , adding that the average quality of engineering graduates in germany was very high . getting the best brains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say it will be difficult to top the high level of engineering courses in germany german labor minister franz müntefering said on wednesday that , in light of the glaring lack of skilled labor , the government planned to create a special commission to look into the problem and make recommendations . he also said the government was working on a points system that would in future apply to all qualified professionals interested in securing a job in germany . " those who best fulfill various criteria such as age , language , theoretical and practical qualifications will receive a permanent residence permit , " müntefering told german daily passauer neuen presse . sven renkel , spokesman for the association of german engineers , vdi , said the points system was a step in the right direction . " it 's good if we can get the best brains for germany , " renkel said .

19 , that it proposed using untapped funds worth 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.33 billion -rrb- to plug a hole left in the 3.4 billion euro galileo project after private companies refused to pay part of the bill . " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " said european commission vice-president , jacques barrot .
" today i have come up with all the facts and figures to enable the european parliament and ministers to take the necessary decisions on the program and its funding by the end of the year . " eu ministers admitted in june that plans to secure private financing for galileo had failed , but they did not agree whether a resulting shortfall should be covered by individual eu states or the 27-nation bloc 's collective budget . the new money for galileo is to come from funds budgeted for this year and 2008 which will not be used in areas such as agriculture .
each year , several billion euros earmarked for various projects remain unspent and are returned to national coffers . eutelsat expresses interest in galileo galileo 's original financing plan recommended that public money pay for the first four satellites .
a private consortium of companies building the satellites was then to pay for two-thirds of the 26 remaining satellites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner barrot said time is running out the french satellite group eutelsat said it intended to step into the galileo project . " eutelsat is ideally suited to plan and provide the fleet of 26 satellites for galileo , " chief executive giuliano berretta told the german business daily handelsblatt on tuesday . berretta said eutelsat already implemented specific elements of galileo , for example through its europe-wide navigation system for trucks , euteltracs .

the european commission has adopted draft legislation that would separate power generation from distribution networks .
the aim is to restrict the influence of big utility companies .
but not everyone is happy . the idea behind the proposals is to keep large energy providers from exclusive control over the supply of natural gas and electricity to the european bloc .
in part , the initiative is aimed at russia , which provides around a quarter of europe 's gas , since the proposals would ban foreign firms from owning transmission networks - unless agreements are reached between the eu and the companies ' home countries .
but the proposals would also force utility companies within the eu - for instance , germany 's e.on or electricite de france - to sell off distribution networks or hand over control to an independent operator .
and that has drawn mixed reactions .
necessary reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal is meant to give others a chance to get into the game the commission justified the proposals by saying they would boost competition and allow new operators to enter the market .
the president of germany 's association of energy consumers , aribert peters , welcomed the initiative , saying in a radio interview that it was the only way to lower prices and to ensure a level playing field .
but both germany and france would like to see their big utility companies retain more influence and are likely to try to negotiate compromises in the proposed legislation .
the energy spokesman for germany 's governing christian democratic union , joachim pfeiffer , said in a radio interview that uncoupling providers from distributors was " a completely wrong path " and that previous liberalizing reforms should be given a chance to take effect . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission has adopted draft legislation that would separate power generation from distribution networks .
the aim is to restrict the influence of big utility companies .
but not everyone is happy . the idea behind the proposals is to keep large energy providers from exclusive control over the supply of natural gas and electricity to the european bloc .
in part , the initiative is aimed at russia , which provides around a quarter of europe 's gas , since the proposals would ban foreign firms from owning transmission networks - unless agreements are reached between the eu and the companies ' home countries .
but the proposals would also force utility companies within the eu - for instance , germany 's e.on or electricite de france - to sell off distribution networks or hand over control to an independent operator .
and that has drawn mixed reactions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 19.09.2007 germany to open job market to eastern european engineers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : engineering in germany is often lonely work the german cabinet has approved plans to plug a shortage of skilled labor by relaxing work restrictions on engineers from new eu member states as well as lowering barriers for foreign students to work in germany . the measures would apply to electrical and mechanical engineers from the 10 nations that joined the european union in 2004 , the german labor ministry said in a statement on wednesday , sept .
19 . engineers from the mainly southern and eastern european nations will be allowed to work in germany from nov .
1 , if the cabinet 's decision is approved by parliament next month . the cabinet also decided that students from the new eu member states who have completed high school in germany would be allowed to work in the country . major skills crunch the measures are aimed at plugging a major skills shortage in the country which is estimated to cost germany more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- this year , according to a study commissioned by the german economics ministry last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has n't shied away from letting in workers from the new eu member states unlike countries like great britain , which opened its labor market almost immediately to nationals from the new eu member states , germany imposed a two-year work restriction on them in 2004 .
last year , the german government extended this restriction for another three years due to fears of being flooded by cheap labor . the decision was sharply criticized by german business and industry leaders who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors and warned that a thin workforce could seriously undermine the country 's economic competitiveness in the long run . the german economy , the biggest in the euro zone , is experiencing a robust recovery after years in the doldrums and companies have begun a hiring offensive . the skills crunch is especially acute in engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
experts estimate that germany currently has a shortage of 20,000 to 40,000 engineers . an annual survey published by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- pointed out that for every 100 german engineers who are about to retire , only 90 freshly qualified ones enter the market . topping german education levels a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't enough young german engineers to replace those who retire though experts welcomed the moves to ease access to the german labor market for engineers from eastern europe , some warned that it will take more to tackle the problem . carola feller of the german engineering federation , vdma , pointed out that some classical immigration countries had a much better image than germany .
german attempts to lure qualified professionals are also not especially attractive , she added . so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros - a figure that experts say is unrealistically high . " there 's a big question mark over whether it will really ease the problem , " feller said . she admitted that education levels at high schools and colleges in eastern europe are relatively good and that there are few problems with the german language since english is often the norm in the engineering sector . but feller also warned it would be difficult to top the high quality of basic engineering courses taught in germany . " if the students -lsb- from eastern europe -rsb- are fit in theoretical knowledge , if they can manage to analyze and solve problems - only then is it likely that a company will be interested in them , " feller said , adding that the average quality of engineering graduates in germany was very high . getting the best brains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say it will be difficult to top the high level of engineering courses in germany german labor minister franz müntefering said on wednesday that , in light of the glaring lack of skilled labor , the government planned to create a special commission to look into the problem and make recommendations . he also said the government was working on a points system that would in future apply to all qualified professionals interested in securing a job in germany .

19 . engineers from the mainly southern and eastern european nations will be allowed to work in germany from nov .
1 , if the cabinet 's decision is approved by parliament next month . the cabinet also decided that students from the new eu member states who have completed high school in germany would be allowed to work in the country . major skills crunch the measures are aimed at plugging a major skills shortage in the country which is estimated to cost germany more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- this year , according to a study commissioned by the german economics ministry last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has n't shied away from letting in workers from the new eu member states unlike countries like great britain , which opened its labor market almost immediately to nationals from the new eu member states , germany imposed a two-year work restriction on them in 2004 .
last year , the german government extended this restriction for another three years due to fears of being flooded by cheap labor . the decision was sharply criticized by german business and industry leaders who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors and warned that a thin workforce could seriously undermine the country 's economic competitiveness in the long run . the german economy , the biggest in the euro zone , is experiencing a robust recovery after years in the doldrums and companies have begun a hiring offensive . the skills crunch is especially acute in engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
experts estimate that germany currently has a shortage of 20,000 to 40,000 engineers . an annual survey published by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- pointed out that for every 100 german engineers who are about to retire , only 90 freshly qualified ones enter the market . topping german education levels a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't enough young german engineers to replace those who retire though experts welcomed the moves to ease access to the german labor market for engineers from eastern europe , some warned that it will take more to tackle the problem . carola feller of the german engineering federation , vdma , pointed out that some classical immigration countries had a much better image than germany .
german attempts to lure qualified professionals are also not especially attractive , she added . so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros - a figure that experts say is unrealistically high . " there 's a big question mark over whether it will really ease the problem , " feller said . she admitted that education levels at high schools and colleges in eastern europe are relatively good and that there are few problems with the german language since english is often the norm in the engineering sector . but feller also warned it would be difficult to top the high quality of basic engineering courses taught in germany . " if the students -lsb- from eastern europe -rsb- are fit in theoretical knowledge , if they can manage to analyze and solve problems - only then is it likely that a company will be interested in them , " feller said , adding that the average quality of engineering graduates in germany was very high . getting the best brains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts say it will be difficult to top the high level of engineering courses in germany german labor minister franz müntefering said on wednesday that , in light of the glaring lack of skilled labor , the government planned to create a special commission to look into the problem and make recommendations . he also said the government was working on a points system that would in future apply to all qualified professionals interested in securing a job in germany . " those who best fulfill various criteria such as age , language , theoretical and practical qualifications will receive a permanent residence permit , " müntefering told german daily passauer neuen presse . sven renkel , spokesman for the association of german engineers , vdi , said the points system was a step in the right direction .

19 , that it proposed using untapped funds worth 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.33 billion -rrb- to plug a hole left in the 3.4 billion euro galileo project after private companies refused to pay part of the bill . " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " said european commission vice-president , jacques barrot .
" today i have come up with all the facts and figures to enable the european parliament and ministers to take the necessary decisions on the program and its funding by the end of the year . " eu ministers admitted in june that plans to secure private financing for galileo had failed , but they did not agree whether a resulting shortfall should be covered by individual eu states or the 27-nation bloc 's collective budget . the new money for galileo is to come from funds budgeted for this year and 2008 which will not be used in areas such as agriculture .
each year , several billion euros earmarked for various projects remain unspent and are returned to national coffers . eutelsat expresses interest in galileo galileo 's original financing plan recommended that public money pay for the first four satellites .
a private consortium of companies building the satellites was then to pay for two-thirds of the 26 remaining satellites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner barrot said time is running out the french satellite group eutelsat said it intended to step into the galileo project . " eutelsat is ideally suited to plan and provide the fleet of 26 satellites for galileo , " chief executive giuliano berretta told the german business daily handelsblatt on tuesday . berretta said eutelsat already implemented specific elements of galileo , for example through its europe-wide navigation system for trucks , euteltracs . " we do not want to take on a leading role in galileo , " berretta said .
" but we 're offering to play an active role in order to avoid further delays . " critics question galileo 's purpose galileo is intended to be an independent , european alternative to the american global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- .
yet while the us system , run by the defense department , is offered free of charge to businesses , galileo plans to charge its users . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's 30 satellites are supposed to form a worldwide network galileo is expected to be up and running by the end of 2012 .

schalke lost 1-0 at home to valencia , while werder went down to 2-1 to real madrid . normally , a close loss in madrid 's santiago bernabeu stadium is a moral victory , but bremen should have had more on tuesday night against a hardly regal real .
both teams were slow out of the blocks , and the spanish giants , in particular , looked as though they were still in summer-vacation mode .
but some sloppy werder defending staked the hosts to an early lead .
in the 16th minute , ruud van nistelrooy found his unmarked strike partner raul , who headed home for the 1-0 advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real got the result without impressing bremen got a curious equalizer 60 seconds later .
striker boubacar sanogo squeezed a cross , which appeared to be deflected or mis-hit , through the arms of normally reliable real keeper iker casillas .
bremen had loads of possession in the second half but lacked precision .
van nistelrooy decided the match for real in the 74th minute after werder neglected his ominous presence in the box .
the match reinforced early-season impressions that this bremen squad is nowhere as good as the teams of the past few years .

more than 160 years after it was completed , it will connect up the transport network the capital is building to prepare for the 2012 olympics .
running between rotherhithe and wapping , its quality fills modern engineers with admiration .
brunel employed his son isambard - aged just 19 - as resident engineer .
it was their first job together , the first tunnel anywhere through soft ground under water , and the oldest tunnel on the present london underground .
" victorian brickwork - particularly the early brickwork - was of a tremendous standard , " explains barrie noble , construction manager for transport for london , who is working on the building of the new railway . "
it 's such an important iconic piece of engineering " robert hulse , brunel museum the tunnel was relined in the mid-1990s as part of a compromise after a fierce disagreement between london underground and english heritage .
some campaigners opposed the relining .
but mr noble says it gave the tunnel a new lease of life .
" we do n't intend to do anything to interfere with the fabric of the tunnel , " he says .
" brunel and his team and his workmen were excellent . "
the elder brunel invented a tunnelling shield as a way of dealing with the waterlogged soft ground beneath the thames - a cast iron structure that moved forward as the ground was cut , with bricklayers constructing the double tunnel behind .
it was , as mr noble says , " a long way before its time " .
with no giant cutting tools , it meant 36 miners , each in his own cell in the shield , removed oak planks one at a time and cut the soil behind to a depth of four inches .
seven men drowned during the digging - workers had to deal with sudden ignitions of marsh gas and constant inflows of water , including five major floods , in the worst of which isambard brunel nearly died .
" here - almost by accident - brunel stumbled on how you build mass urban transport , " says robert hulse , director of the brunel museum in the old pump engine house at rotherhithe , which attracts 11,500 visitors a year .
inventing mass urban transport was not brunel 's intention .
conceived in the pre-railway age , the tunnel was meant to provide a route under the river for cargoes which had been landed on the wrong bank .
two enormous shafts 250 feet across were to be constructed at either end and horses were somehow to be persuaded to pull carts up and down spiral ramps .
million visits in the event , there was never nearly enough money to build the giant shafts , and the smaller shafts that still exist today remained the only way in and out of the tunnel for more than 25 years .
on its first day of opening 50,000 people walked through the tunnel , which was hailed as one of the new wonders of the world , and a million visits were chalked up in the first 15 weeks .
but the novelty wore off , and after 20 years of precarious existence as an underwater shopping arcade and a venue for tightrope walkers and sword swallowers , it was finally sold in 1869 and became a railway tunnel .
the skill of the workforce and the genius of the brunels had achieved their aim at last - the tunnel carried cargo .
it was electrified and became part of the underground in 1913 .
further north on the new east london railway , mr noble points to more examples of the amazing quality of victorian builders ' work .
from wapping the line will continue to whitechapel - as the present east london line does - and then join the viaduct which formerly carried the line north from broad street station .
disused since 1986 , the 170-arch viaduct defied engineers ' fears about its condition , says mr noble .
the arches - built in 1862 - have joins to the new brickwork which was added when they were widened in 1872 .
" all of those joints were totally watertight .
we never found any that leaked .
the standard of workmanship 's incredible , " says mr noble .
he explains how in one set of arches , an attempt was made to inject grout into the brickwork to fill voids which the engineers thought must have developed .
" there was very little flow - and we were astounded because these are so old we thought they 'd be falling apart .
we just could n't understand so we did intrusive investigations : we took out bricks and we actually did radar surveys . "
what they found was that of five levels of brickwork only the first , which had been exposed to the elements , had deteriorated to any extent .
expansion plans the existing east london line , including brunel 's tunnel , closes on the night of 22-23 december , to reopen as part of the new east london railway from dalston to west croydon and crystal palace .
" i 'm delighted and of course it immediately increases our catchment area .
when we have the overground people will find it much easier to get here , " says robert hulse of the brunel museum .
he takes parties of visitors through the tunnel by courtesy of the east london line managers - who turn on the lights - and drivers , who slow down the trains .
for him the relining of the 1990s has been a good thing .
" i know the purists got upset about them rendering over brunel 's original brickwork - but in rendering it over they have made it visible and accessible , " he says .
news that london underground was going to spray-concrete brunel 's brickwork led to angry protests , and the listing of the tunnel on the afternoon before work was due to start in march 1995 .
in the end reinforced concrete was moulded to imitate brunel 's original rendering on the tunnel and the 60 arched openings between the two tracks .
as the london overground is built , the brunel museum is preparing for an expansion of its own , taking in brunel 's existing shaft , which at present stands empty above the entrance to the tunnel .
how the space in the shaft will be used is yet to be worked out .
it seems likely to include some kind of viewing platform to watch the trains using the 160-year-old tunnel .
" it 's such an important , iconic piece of engineering ...
i 'm sure there 'll be lots of very clever engineering solutions to the problem of how we best display what we have here , " says robert hulse .
it is a good place for clever engineering ideas .

more than 160 years after it was completed , it will connect up the transport network the capital is building to prepare for the 2012 olympics .
running between rotherhithe and wapping , its quality fills modern engineers with admiration .
brunel employed his son isambard - aged just 19 - as resident engineer .
it was their first job together , the first tunnel anywhere through soft ground under water , and the oldest tunnel on the present london underground .
" victorian brickwork - particularly the early brickwork - was of a tremendous standard , " explains barrie noble , construction manager for transport for london , who is working on the building of the new railway .
it 's such an important iconic piece of engineering robert hulse , brunel museum the tunnel was relined in the mid-1990s as part of a compromise after a fierce disagreement between london underground and english heritage .
some campaigners opposed the relining .
but mr noble says it gave the tunnel a new lease of life .
" we do n't intend to do anything to interfere with the fabric of the tunnel , " he says .
" brunel and his team and his workmen were excellent . "
the elder brunel invented a tunnelling shield as a way of dealing with the waterlogged soft ground beneath the thames - a cast iron structure that moved forward as the ground was cut , with bricklayers constructing the double tunnel behind .
seven men drowned in floods when water burst through the shield it was , as mr noble says , " a long way before its time " .
with no giant cutting tools , it meant 36 miners , each in his own cell in the shield , removed oak planks one at a time and cut the soil behind to a depth of four inches .
seven men drowned during the digging - workers had to deal with sudden ignitions of marsh gas and constant inflows of water , including five major floods , in the worst of which isambard brunel nearly died .
" here - almost by accident - brunel stumbled on how you build mass urban transport , " says robert hulse , director of the brunel museum in the old pump engine house at rotherhithe , which attracts 11,500 visitors a year .
inventing mass urban transport was not brunel 's intention .
conceived in the pre-railway age , the tunnel was meant to provide a route under the river for cargoes which had been landed on the wrong bank .
two enormous shafts 250 feet across were to be constructed at either end and horses were somehow to be persuaded to pull carts up and down spiral ramps .
million visits in the event , there was never nearly enough money to build the giant shafts , and the smaller shafts that still exist today remained the only way in and out of the tunnel for more than 25 years .
on its first day of opening 50,000 people walked through the tunnel , which was hailed as one of the new wonders of the world , and a million visits were chalked up in the first 15 weeks .
but the novelty wore off , and after 20 years of precarious existence as an underwater shopping arcade and a venue for tightrope walkers and sword swallowers , it was finally sold in 1869 and became a railway tunnel .
the skill of the workforce and the genius of the brunels had achieved their aim at last - the tunnel carried cargo .

more than 160 years after it was completed , it will connect up the transport network the capital is building to prepare for the 2012 olympics .
running between rotherhithe and wapping , its quality fills modern engineers with admiration .
brunel employed his son isambard - aged just 19 - as resident engineer .
it was their first job together , the first tunnel anywhere through soft ground under water , and the oldest tunnel on the present london underground .
" victorian brickwork - particularly the early brickwork - was of a tremendous standard , " explains barrie noble , construction manager for transport for london , who is working on the building of the new railway .
it 's such an important iconic piece of engineering robert hulse , brunel museum the tunnel was relined in the mid-1990s as part of a compromise after a fierce disagreement between london underground and english heritage .
some campaigners opposed the relining .
but mr noble says it gave the tunnel a new lease of life .
" we do n't intend to do anything to interfere with the fabric of the tunnel , " he says .
" brunel and his team and his workmen were excellent . "
the elder brunel invented a tunnelling shield as a way of dealing with the waterlogged soft ground beneath the thames - a cast iron structure that moved forward as the ground was cut , with bricklayers constructing the double tunnel behind .
seven men drowned in floods when water burst through the shield it was , as mr noble says , " a long way before its time " .
with no giant cutting tools , it meant 36 miners , each in his own cell in the shield , removed oak planks one at a time and cut the soil behind to a depth of four inches .
seven men drowned during the digging - workers had to deal with sudden ignitions of marsh gas and constant inflows of water , including five major floods , in the worst of which isambard brunel nearly died .
" here - almost by accident - brunel stumbled on how you build mass urban transport , " says robert hulse , director of the brunel museum in the old pump engine house at rotherhithe , which attracts 11,500 visitors a year .
inventing mass urban transport was not brunel 's intention .
conceived in the pre-railway age , the tunnel was meant to provide a route under the river for cargoes which had been landed on the wrong bank .
two enormous shafts 250 feet across were to be constructed at either end and horses were somehow to be persuaded to pull carts up and down spiral ramps .
million visits in the event , there was never nearly enough money to build the giant shafts , and the smaller shafts that still exist today remained the only way in and out of the tunnel for more than 25 years .
on its first day of opening 50,000 people walked through the tunnel , which was hailed as one of the new wonders of the world , and a million visits were chalked up in the first 15 weeks .
but the novelty wore off , and after 20 years of precarious existence as an underwater shopping arcade and a venue for tightrope walkers and sword swallowers , it was finally sold in 1869 and became a railway tunnel .
the skill of the workforce and the genius of the brunels had achieved their aim at last - the tunnel carried cargo .
it was electrified and became part of the underground in 1913 .

more than 160 years after it was completed , it will connect up the transport network the capital is building to prepare for the 2012 olympics .
running between rotherhithe and wapping , its quality fills modern engineers with admiration .
brunel employed his son isambard - aged just 19 - as resident engineer .
it was their first job together , the first tunnel anywhere through soft ground under water , and the oldest tunnel on the present london underground .
" victorian brickwork - particularly the early brickwork - was of a tremendous standard , " explains barrie noble , construction manager for transport for london , who is working on the building of the new railway .
it 's such an important iconic piece of engineering robert hulse , brunel museum the tunnel was relined in the mid-1990s as part of a compromise after a fierce disagreement between london underground and english heritage .
some campaigners opposed the relining .
but mr noble says it gave the tunnel a new lease of life .
" we do n't intend to do anything to interfere with the fabric of the tunnel , " he says .
" brunel and his team and his workmen were excellent . "
the elder brunel invented a tunnelling shield as a way of dealing with the waterlogged soft ground beneath the thames - a cast iron structure that moved forward as the ground was cut , with bricklayers constructing the double tunnel behind .
seven men drowned in floods when water burst through the shield it was , as mr noble says , " a long way before its time " .
with no giant cutting tools , it meant 36 miners , each in his own cell in the shield , removed oak planks one at a time and cut the soil behind to a depth of four inches .
seven men drowned during the digging - workers had to deal with sudden ignitions of marsh gas and constant inflows of water , including five major floods , in the worst of which isambard brunel nearly died .
" here - almost by accident - brunel stumbled on how you build mass urban transport , " says robert hulse , director of the brunel museum in the old pump engine house at rotherhithe , which attracts 11,500 visitors a year .
inventing mass urban transport was not brunel 's intention .
conceived in the pre-railway age , the tunnel was meant to provide a route under the river for cargoes which had been landed on the wrong bank .
two enormous shafts 250 feet across were to be constructed at either end and horses were somehow to be persuaded to pull carts up and down spiral ramps .
million visits in the event , there was never nearly enough money to build the giant shafts , and the smaller shafts that still exist today remained the only way in and out of the tunnel for more than 25 years .

more than 160 years after it was completed , it will connect up the transport network the capital is building to prepare for the 2012 olympics .
running between rotherhithe and wapping , its quality fills modern engineers with admiration .
brunel employed his son isambard - aged just 19 - as resident engineer .
it was their first job together , the first tunnel anywhere through soft ground under water , and the oldest tunnel on the present london underground .
" victorian brickwork - particularly the early brickwork - was of a tremendous standard , " explains barrie noble , construction manager for transport for london , who is working on the building of the new railway .
it 's such an important iconic piece of engineering robert hulse , brunel museum the tunnel was relined in the mid-1990s as part of a compromise after a fierce disagreement between london underground and english heritage .
some campaigners opposed the relining .
but mr noble says it gave the tunnel a new lease of life .
" we do n't intend to do anything to interfere with the fabric of the tunnel , " he says .
" brunel and his team and his workmen were excellent . "
the elder brunel invented a tunnelling shield as a way of dealing with the waterlogged soft ground beneath the thames - a cast iron structure that moved forward as the ground was cut , with bricklayers constructing the double tunnel behind .
seven men drowned in floods when water burst through the shield it was , as mr noble says , " a long way before its time " .
with no giant cutting tools , it meant 36 miners , each in his own cell in the shield , removed oak planks one at a time and cut the soil behind to a depth of four inches .
seven men drowned during the digging - workers had to deal with sudden ignitions of marsh gas and constant inflows of water , including five major floods , in the worst of which isambard brunel nearly died .
" here - almost by accident - brunel stumbled on how you build mass urban transport , " says robert hulse , director of the brunel museum in the old pump engine house at rotherhithe , which attracts 11,500 visitors a year .
inventing mass urban transport was not brunel 's intention .
conceived in the pre-railway age , the tunnel was meant to provide a route under the river for cargoes which had been landed on the wrong bank .
two enormous shafts 250 feet across were to be constructed at either end and horses were somehow to be persuaded to pull carts up and down spiral ramps .

first minister rhodri morgan has said no decision has been made on the future of neurosurgery services in the north .
he has said an expert panel will conduct an independent review .

they are expected to claim that a row over neurosurgery services for patients in north wales shows local needs are being ignored .
first minister rhodri morgan has said no decision has been made on the future of neurosurgery services in the north .
he has said an expert panel will conduct an independent review .
the conservatives will use their opposition debate to argue that every effort should be made to ensure patients can be treated as close to their homes as possible and that patient needs should be paramount .
they are expected to say that any plans to transfer planned operations for north wales neurosurgery patients from liverpool to cardiff or swansea defies common sense .
neurosurgery treats disorders of the nervous system , including diseases of the head , brain and spine .
in wales , adult neurosurgery is performed in both cardiff and swansea .
' pure scaremongering ' but patients from north wales currently travel the relatively short distance across the english border to the walton centre for neurology and neurosurgery in liverpool for treatment .
in 2006 , plans to create a single service in cardiff were announced after a health commission wales report .
nick bourne am , leader of the official opposition in the assembly , said : " while we accept that a modern nhs must reflect the increasing demands placed upon it , it is vital that wherever possible it also meets the needs of patients .
" the provision of local , effective , reliable healthcare is paramount and must be safeguarded .
" clearly there will be some centralisation of specialist services , but the assembly government 's plans for neurosurgery patients make no sense whatsoever . "
' consultation ' when questioned in the senedd on monday , mr morgan moved to puncture the tory motion by claiming no decision on neurosurgery services had been made and that any suggestion to the contrary was " pure scaremongering " .
he went on to say the next move would be to appoint an expert panel which would begin the work of looking at future provision .
he told the senedd : " speculation on the future of neurosurgery is unhelpful as the plans have not yet been formulated and there will be full , open and transparent consultation . "

the study 's findings will be reported back to the trust boards in november , and would be put out to public consultation before any merger was agreed .
dave galligan , unison 's head of health in wales , said : " there seems to be merger mania at the moment .

stephen timms , minister for competitiveness , ordered a summit to look at the role of government in providing next-generation broadband .
while other countries are investing in new ways to deliver higher bandwidth , the uk is seen as lagging behind .
mr timms said broadband infrastructure was one of his " personal priorities " .
" today we face a new challenge .
other countries are starting to invest in new , fibre-based infrastructure , delivering considerably higher bandwidth than is available in the uk today , " mr timms told the broadband stakeholder group and others attending a meeting on tuesday evening .
" i have decided to chair a high level summit later this year to consider the circumstances that might trigger public sector intervention and the form that intervention might take , " he said .
huge costs the event was organised by the broadband stakeholder group to outline its own plans to improve the way next-generation broadband is rolled out in the uk .
according to richard allan , a member of the broadband stakeholder group and director of government affairs at cisco , the uk needs to act now in order to keep its place in the top 25 % of broadband nations .
" that should be one of the targets that the government sets if it wants to stay economically competitive , " he said .
mr allan believes that the uk should have 40 % of its citizens connected to fibre that can deliver broadband speeds of up to 100mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- by 2012 .
" the current copper-based system is limited by adsl which means 24 megabits under very good conditions , " he said .
it is estimated that upgrading the whole of the uk to a fibre-based network could cost £ 10-15bn .
while other countries , including france , germany and italy are already looking at ways of improving the so-called access or last-mile network which connects to people 's homes , there is so far little investment in the uk .
according to mr allan , the reasons for this are part-historical .
" there is evidence that the cost of civil engineering work in the uk is particularly high , " he said .
he believes government intervention in lowering these costs as well as help with planning laws and providing the necessary ducting for fibre would be a step in the right direction .
in some countries ducts for fibre have been made available via municipal sewers although mr allan is not sure this is the solution in the uk .
" traditionally uk sewers are deeper and they are not municipally owned but there are other ways to keep the disruption of digging up roads to a minimum , for example with micro ducts which sees fibre blown through long runs , " he said .
the bsg is also calling on ofcom to provide a regulatory framework to support investment in next-generation networks .

stephen timms , minister for competitiveness , ordered a summit to look at the role of government in providing next-generation broadband .
while other countries are investing in new ways to deliver higher bandwidth , the uk is seen as lagging behind .
mr timms said broadband infrastructure was one of his " personal priorities " .
" today we face a new challenge .
other countries are starting to invest in new , fibre-based infrastructure , delivering considerably higher bandwidth than is available in the uk today , " mr timms told the broadband stakeholder group and others attending a meeting on tuesday evening .
" i have decided to chair a high level summit later this year to consider the circumstances that might trigger public sector intervention and the form that intervention might take , " he said .
huge costs the event was organised by the broadband stakeholder group to outline its own plans to improve the way next-generation broadband is rolled out in the uk .
according to richard allan , a member of the broadband stakeholder group and director of government affairs at cisco , the uk needs to act now in order to keep its place in the top 25 % of broadband nations .
" that should be one of the targets that the government sets if it wants to stay economically competitive , " he said .
mr allan believes that the uk should have 40 % of its citizens connected to fibre that can deliver broadband speeds of up to 100mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- by 2012 .
" the current copper-based system is limited by adsl which means 24 megabits under very good conditions , " he said .
it is estimated that upgrading the whole of the uk to a fibre-based network could cost £ 10-15bn .
while other countries , including france , germany and italy are already looking at ways of improving the so-called access or last-mile network which connects to people 's homes , there is so far little investment in the uk .
uk sewers may not be suitable for fibre according to mr allan , the reasons for this are part-historical .
" there is evidence that the cost of civil engineering work in the uk is particularly high , " he said .
he believes government intervention in lowering these costs as well as help with planning laws and providing the necessary ducting for fibre would be a step in the right direction .
in some countries ducts for fibre have been made available via municipal sewers although mr allan is not sure this is the solution in the uk .
" traditionally uk sewers are deeper and they are not municipally owned but there are other ways to keep the disruption of digging up roads to a minimum , for example with micro ducts which sees fibre blown through long runs , " he said .
the bsg is also calling on ofcom to provide a regulatory framework to support investment in next-generation networks .

mr allan believes that the uk should have 40 % of its citizens connected to fibre that can deliver broadband speeds of up to 100mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- by 2012 .
" the current copper-based system is limited by adsl which means 24 megabits under very good conditions , " he said .
it is estimated that upgrading the whole of the uk to a fibre-based network could cost £ 10-15bn .
while other countries , including france , germany and italy are already looking at ways of improving the so-called access or last-mile network which connects to people 's homes , there is so far little investment in the uk .
uk sewers may not be suitable for fibre according to mr allan , the reasons for this are part-historical .
" there is evidence that the cost of civil engineering work in the uk is particularly high , " he said .
he believes government intervention in lowering these costs as well as help with planning laws and providing the necessary ducting for fibre would be a step in the right direction .
in some countries ducts for fibre have been made available via municipal sewers although mr allan is not sure this is the solution in the uk .
" traditionally uk sewers are deeper and they are not municipally owned but there are other ways to keep the disruption of digging up roads to a minimum , for example with micro ducts which sees fibre blown through long runs , " he said .
the bsg is also calling on ofcom to provide a regulatory framework to support investment in next-generation networks .

the high street retailer said adjusted pre-tax losses for the six months to 4 august were £ 59.2m , against a loss of £ 66.8m in the same period last year .
strong demand for computer games , books and dvds helped like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of new stores - to rise 0.6 % .
woolworths added it remained cautious ahead of the christmas trading period .
" our first half performance is encouraging , " said trevor bish-jones , woolworths ' chief executive .
" going forward , we remain cautious about the retail environment going into the important second half - so are continuing to run the business tightly . "
woolworths said that the wet weather in recent months had lifted sales of indoor entertainment products .
in particular , the retailer said sales of computer games had shown " significant " sales increases thanks to the introduction of new consoles such as the nintendo wii .
book sales had been helped by the launch of the seventh harry potter book , and dvd sales had been lifted by a strong release schedule .
the boost to sales of computer games , books and dvds was " more than enough " to offset falling sales of cds .

but this year , during the holy month of ramadan , there is a real struggle to make ends meet .
the price of basic food and fuel has soared in recent months , putting enormous strain on consumers .
" at the moment , it 's the biggest problem we face , " said one customer , paying for several bags of vegetables at a roadside stall .
" i used to be able to buy my onions and tomatoes for 60 afghanis .
now it 's 100 afghanis .
it 's suddenly got very high . "
" it 's the same for everything , potatoes , all the vegetables , " said omar , selling his wares from a small wooden cart .
" the big businessmen are responsible .
they hoard everything and push the prices up . "
surcharging a small crowd soon gathered around us .
everyone had a story to tell .
" why is it so expensive ? " shouted one man .
" you should ask the government !
karzai does n't care about ordinary people . "
president hamid karzai says that he does .
he convened a recent meeting at the presidential palace to deal specifically with the issue of price rises .
one cabinet minister pointed out that household gas , which should be sold at about 40 afghanis -lrb- $ 0.8 -rrb- per kilogram , is currently selling for 80 afghanis .
the government has promised to identify anyone responsible for hoarding and surcharging and punish them .
but that 's not much consolation for drivers buying fuel for their vehicles at a nearby petrol station .
" if the prices continue to rise , " one driver said , " we 'll have to get out of our cars and start walking . "
he described queuing at the only state-run petrol station in kabul - where the prices are cheaper - for three hours .
" i gave up and came over here . "
another driver , hashmi , arrived , to fill up his sports utility vehicle .
the amount he pays has risen recently by 40 % .
" it 's unbearable , " he said .
" forty per cent makes a big difference even for the rich .
but for the poor it 's a killer . "
everyone has a theory about why the price has suddenly shot up so much .
iran is said to be supplying less fuel than it was last year , and other neighbouring countries have increased the taxes they charge .
lack of security elsewhere in the country is also a factor , as is the all-pervasive issue of corruption .
businessmen have to pay protection money - " nuisance taxes " - to transport their goods .
and any increase is passed on to the consumer .
real achievement still some people are clearly taking advantage of the situation to make far more money than they should .

indeed , it was mr jobs who was keen to push the marriage metaphor when he described the courtship process with the different uk networks , which ended with o2 winning the contract .
" we dated a few people who we did n't get married to , " he said .
" so there are a few unhappy girlfriends out there . "
but what does this marriage mean for the uk mobile phone market ?
will customers really want to pay what apple and o2 are going to charge the iphone 's early adopters ?
and given the high price that the network and its customers will face , will the iphone prove such a great deal ?
the o2 website crashed soon after the iphone announcement , apparently gasping under the weight of inquiries from excited customers .
they may be a little more cautious once they look more closely at the price - £ 269 is pretty steep these days for a mobile phone , when a lot of handsets are handed over for nothing to customers who sign up to a monthly contract .
but the cost of ownership does n't stop there .
the iphone 's users will have to sign up for an 18-month contract , at a minimum price of £ 35 a month .
if you want a bigger package , with 1,200 minutes of calls and 500 texts , you will pay £ 55 a month .
over the 18-month contract , that adds up a grand total of £ 1,259 .
you do , though , get free access to 7,500 wi-fi hotspots across the uk .
nokia vs ' i-factor ' but just look at another phone offered by o2 and carphone warehouse .
the n95 is nokia 's big hit of recent months and , in technical terms , it is more advanced than its new apple rival .
it has a five-megapixel camera , compared with the two-megapixel version on the iphone .
it is 3g , which means it will provide far superior surfing speeds to those on the iphone , and it has gps , which should make it easier to navigate with nokia than with apple .
on some websites you have to pay £ 279.99 for it with the £ 35-a-month contract - but the £ 50 tariff gives you the handset for free and offers just as many minutes and texts as the iphone 's most expensive contract .
so at a total cost of £ 900 for 18 months , the n95 is substantially cheaper than the iphone .
and if you get the n95 from o2 direct , the phone is thrown in for free if you take out a £ 35-a-month contract for 18 month - or just £ 630 .
of course , what i am leaving out is the i-factor - that apple design flair and sheer useability which made the ipod such a big hit and has created such a buzz around the phone .
but nokia - and o2 's rival networks - are bound to hit back with keen prices and new handsets as the christmas sales battle gets under way .
already vodafone , which many thought would win the iphone contract , has signed a deal to offer the musicstation subscription download service on its handsets as an alternative to itunes .
o2 fought very hard to win the hand of apple and will now have to hand over a sizeable chunk of its iphone revenue , though both sides are being coy about the details .
but the network , now owned by spain 's telefonica , believes that steve jobs ' " magical " handset will win it many new customers from its rivals .
and judging by what happened to its website this morning , it may just be right .

you see boredom , resentment and frustration everywhere .
this is fertile ground for spreading radicalism .
some of al-qaeda 's biggest names grew up in these streets , like abu musab al-zarqawi .
possibly the most notorious insurgent in iraq , he is blamed for bombings , assassinations and beheading foreign hostages in iraq , including briton ken bigley .
american troops killed zarqawi a year ago but we came to meet his friends and followers back home in jordan .
they are recruiting waves of new warriors - self-styled holy fighters against the west in iraq .
it was not easy to get into contact with jordan 's jihadis .
crackdowns by the secret police here make getting to iraq extremely difficult .
veteran jihadi 's story so , they only agreed to meet us at night .
we were told at the very last minute who we were seeing , without being given anyone 's real names , of course , and where .
abu abdel rahman is a veteran jihadi .
he told us he had been to iraq from jordan five times . "
you infidel countries .
you came to fight us , in muslim lands .
what do you expect : that we greet you with roses ?
muslims do n't kill for the sake of killing .
america and its allies have dug their own graves in iraq " abu abdel rahman , jihadi " when i am in iraq i feel calm , happy and comfortable .
there is a lot of blood , killing and carnage but i know i am there in god 's name , " he says .
he was keen to point out that he and his fellow mujahideen were not blood-thirsty , just on the defensive .
he said , that is why he and other jordanian jihadis agreed to meet the bbc .
they wanted us to understand their point of view .
" you infidel countries .
you came to fight us , in muslim lands .
what do you expect : that we greet you with roses ?
muslims do n't kill for the sake of killing .
america and its allies have dug their own graves in iraq , " he says .
i also asked abu abdel rahman about muslims killing muslims in iraq in what seems to be an increasingly vicious vengeful power struggle between radical sunni and shia muslims there .
he agreed the phenomenon was regretful but said , as a sunni , it was his duty to continue fighting against what he described as the shia crescent .
but , he insisted , his prime concern , remained ridding muslim lands of non-muslims .
back home from iraq , abu abdel rahman now actively recruits other jordanians to fight .
he says it is not difficult to persuade them .
dramatic videos people have so little in these neighbourhoods but what they do have is satellite television , bringing bloody images of iraq straight in to their homes .
abdullah , 16 , is one of abu abdel rahman 's newest recruits .
i asked him why he was prepared to leave his family in jordan , to fight in a foreign country .
i wanted to know if he was afraid to die .
" i see the pictures on tv , how they kill muslims in iraq .
it makes me feel so much hate , i want to kill them , " says abdullah .
" my cousin was also killed in iraq on his way home from school .
i want to die there , in god 's name , to stop them killing any more children . "
catching the eye and exciting the passions of young muslims in jordan and elsewhere are jihadi videos .
islamist researcher marwan shahada , showed me dozens of them - dramatic images of successful attacks on british and american troops in iraq .
all are accompanied by monotonous , hypnotic chanting of extremist texts .
spreading radicalism is de-stabilising the whole middle east , not just iraq , says mr shahada .
extremists in jordan do not just want to fight abroad , he says , they question leaders back home who seem to support american policy .
" they have a political dispute due to the arab alliance with the americans , " he told me .
" they give the american logistical , political and security support .
so they -lsb- extremist groups -rsb- target many arab countries through their suicide attacks or other means . "
' infidels and believers ' jordan 's authorities are mindful of the threat , especially after the bombing in a five-star hotel in amman two years ago .
jordan 's military courts have just sentenced 17 jordanian nationals for attempting to join iraqi insurgents , and mosques are closely monitored in jordan 's jihadi neighbourhoods .
at the friday prayers we attended , the imam spoke simply of being a good muslim .
but to some in his congregation , that means killing british and american soldiers in iraq .
and even when - and if - all western soldiers leave , abu abdel rahman said the fight will not be over .
" jihad will never end .
we will keep going until judgement day .
it will always be there because there is wrong and there is right , " he says .
" the conflict between the infidels and the believers will continue .
our fight with the americans will end when they leave the muslim world alone .
but jihad does n't end with iraq .
it will continue .
" i encourage every muslim to fight .
i know that there are many muslims out there who dream of becoming martyrs in iraq , in god 's name .
i have children and i hope they too will sacrifice themselves for the good of islam , " says abu adel rahman .

there is a lot of blood , killing and carnage but i know i am there in god 's name , " he says .

i also asked abu abdel rahman about muslims killing muslims in iraq in what seems to be an increasingly vicious vengeful power struggle between radical sunni and shia muslims there .
he agreed the phenomenon was regretful but said , as a sunni , it was his duty to continue fighting against what he described as the shia crescent .

he says it is not difficult to persuade them .

i asked him why he was prepared to leave his family in jordan , to fight in a foreign country .
i wanted to know if he was afraid to die .

you see boredom , resentment and frustration everywhere .
this is fertile ground for spreading radicalism .
some of al-qaeda 's biggest names grew up in these streets , like abu musab al-zarqawi .
possibly the most notorious insurgent in iraq , he is blamed for bombings , assassinations and beheading foreign hostages in iraq , including briton ken bigley .
american troops killed zarqawi a year ago but we came to meet his friends and followers back home in jordan .
they are recruiting waves of new warriors - self-styled holy fighters against the west in iraq .
it was not easy to get into contact with jordan 's jihadis .
crackdowns by the secret police here make getting to iraq extremely difficult .
veteran jihadi 's story so , they only agreed to meet us at night .
we were told at the very last minute who we were seeing , without being given anyone 's real names , of course , and where .
abu abdel rahman is a veteran jihadi .
he told us he had been to iraq from jordan five times .
you infidel countries .
you came to fight us , in muslim lands .
what do you expect : that we greet you with roses ?
muslims do n't kill for the sake of killing .
america and its allies have dug their own graves in iraq abu abdel rahman , jihadi " when i am in iraq i feel calm , happy and comfortable .
there is a lot of blood , killing and carnage but i know i am there in god 's name , " he says .
he was keen to point out that he and his fellow mujahideen were not blood-thirsty , just on the defensive .
he said , that is why he and other jordanian jihadis agreed to meet the bbc .
they wanted us to understand their point of view .
" you infidel countries .
you came to fight us , in muslim lands .
what do you expect : that we greet you with roses ?
muslims do n't kill for the sake of killing .
america and its allies have dug their own graves in iraq , " he says .
i also asked abu abdel rahman about muslims killing muslims in iraq in what seems to be an increasingly vicious vengeful power struggle between radical sunni and shia muslims there .
he agreed the phenomenon was regretful but said , as a sunni , it was his duty to continue fighting against what he described as the shia crescent .
but , he insisted , his prime concern , remained ridding muslim lands of non-muslims .
back home from iraq , abu abdel rahman now actively recruits other jordanians to fight .
he says it is not difficult to persuade them .
dramatic videos people have so little in these neighbourhoods but what they do have is satellite television , bringing bloody images of iraq straight in to their homes .
abdullah says he is ready for martyrdom in iraq abdullah , 16 , is one of abu abdel rahman 's newest recruits .
i asked him why he was prepared to leave his family in jordan , to fight in a foreign country .
i wanted to know if he was afraid to die .
" i see the pictures on tv , how they kill muslims in iraq .
it makes me feel so much hate , i want to kill them , " says abdullah .
" my cousin was also killed in iraq on his way home from school .
i want to die there , in god 's name , to stop them killing any more children . "
catching the eye and exciting the passions of young muslims in jordan and elsewhere are jihadi videos .
islamist researcher marwan shahada , showed me dozens of them - dramatic images of successful attacks on british and american troops in iraq .
all are accompanied by monotonous , hypnotic chanting of extremist texts .
spreading radicalism is de-stabilising the whole middle east , not just iraq , says mr shahada .
extremists in jordan do not just want to fight abroad , he says , they question leaders back home who seem to support american policy .
" they have a political dispute due to the arab alliance with the americans , " he told me .
" they give the american logistical , political and security support .
so they -lsb- extremist groups -rsb- target many arab countries through their suicide attacks or other means . "
' infidels and believers ' jordan 's authorities are mindful of the threat , especially after the bombing in a five-star hotel in amman two years ago .
jihadi videos show attacks on the us-led coalition in iraq jordan 's military courts have just sentenced 17 jordanian nationals for attempting to join iraqi insurgents , and mosques are closely monitored in jordan 's jihadi neighbourhoods .
at the friday prayers we attended , the imam spoke simply of being a good muslim .
but to some in his congregation , that means killing british and american soldiers in iraq .
and even when - and if - all western soldiers leave , abu abdel rahman said the fight will not be over .
" jihad will never end .
we will keep going until judgement day .
it will always be there because there is wrong and there is right , " he says .
" the conflict between the infidels and the believers will continue .
our fight with the americans will end when they leave the muslim world alone .
but jihad does n't end with iraq .
it will continue .
" i encourage every muslim to fight .
i know that there are many muslims out there who dream of becoming martyrs in iraq , in god 's name .
i have children and i hope they too will sacrifice themselves for the good of islam , " says abu adel rahman .

party leaders had wanted a deposit scheme , with customers charged for disposable shopping bags and refunded when they are returned .
but members backed an amendment calling for consideration of a levy on plastic bags , as used in ireland since 2002 .
lib dem mp jo swinson said packaging cost the average family £ 470 a year .
she claimed research showed that using bags made from materials other than plastic could lead to more carbon emissions .
' over-packaging ' a container which could transport 1.5 million plastic bags , could only carry just over 50,000 paper bags , which would push up road haulage emissions .
however , a deposit scheme , rather than penalising shoppers for using plastic bags , would encourage their reuse , she said .
in many cases , the same products are sold with less packaging in other countries martin tod lib dem parliamentary candidate the party also voted for large supermarkets to provide waste points for customers to dump unwanted packaging .
lib dems say total waste produced in the uk has increased by 21 % since 1997 , with householders sending five million tonnes of packaging to landfill sites every year .
a lib dem survey of uk supermarkets found more than 17 billion plastic bags are given away each year .
during a debate at the party 's annual conference in brighton , martin tod , a former marketing director for a packaged goods company , said the uk over-wraps a wide range of products .
mr tod , also the lib dem parliamentary candidate for winchester , gave the example of toothpaste he used from a tube he had designed in his previous job .
poll popularity " it came in a carton and i and my colleagues had actually designed that tube so that it did n't need one ... " he said .
" in many cases , the same products are sold with less packaging in other countries . "
the conference also backed a motion calling for a new national body with prosecution powers to tackle " large scale producers of excess packaging " .
the debate comes as a guardian / icm opinion poll suggests lib dem leader sir menzies campbell is now more popular than conservative leader david cameron .
the poll will come as a major shot in the arm for sir menzies , who has faced continued questions about his leadership during this week 's conference .
' two fingers ' the man most often tipped to succeed him , home affairs spokesman nick clegg , told a fringe meeting he would " probably " bid for the leadership in the future .
but he ruled out a challenge to sir menzies , urging the party to support him and " put two fingers up " at its critics .
" at a time when sir ming is being attacked with barely disguised ageism ... the only response is to pull together , put up two fingers and say , do n't you dare push us around , " said mr clegg .
the lib dems are hoping the policies debated this week - which have focused around the environment and " fairer " taxation - will give them a distinctive platform on which to fight the next general election - and avoid the traditional third party " squeeze " .
the party will also debate constitutional reform - including lowering the voting age to 16 , a bill of rights , a referendum on a written constitution , greater use of citizens ' juries and the introduction of proportional representation for westminster elections .
there will also be emergency motions on guns and gangs - and provision for britain 's armed forces .
