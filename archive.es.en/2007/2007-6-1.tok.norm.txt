program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.06.2007 hiv infections at an all-time high in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids awareness is key , educators say a report shows that germany now has the greatest number of registered new hiv infections since specific records began being kept in 1993 .
last year , the registered number of new infections rose by four percent . according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , germany 's premier scientific research and public health agency , there were 2,611 new hiv infections registered in 2006 .
that is a four-percent rise over the previous year , and the highest increase since new infections specifically began being logged in 1993 .
in its " epidemiological bulletin , " rki reported that the number of registered , newly diagnosed hiv infections had thereby risen 81 percent since 2001 .
however , the institute noted that one reason for that major increase is better methods of detecting and documenting infections .
with that adjustment , the rki estimated that the number of actual new infections between 2001 and 2006 rose by around 40 percent .
while big cities still show a high number of registered new infections , the greatest number was seen in smaller towns of 100,000 people or less .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection and documentation have improved that increase was found among homosexual and heterosexual people alike .
also , northern and southern german states were affected most , while the number of registered new infections stagnated or dropped in central and eastern states .
initial diagnoses highest among the middle-aged also the greatest number of initial diagnoses was found among 40- to 60-year-olds .
the group with the greatest number of reported new infections remains homosexual men - at 52 percent ; heterosexuals compose 14.6 percent of the people who registered infections for the first time in 2006 .
women made up 19 percent .
the institute reported that 11 children were born with hiv last year in germany ; in seven of the cases , the mothers had not been tested for the virus .
proper medical , pre-natal care can often prevent a mother-to-child transmission of hiv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children with hiv are abandoned among the 2,611 people reported with new infections last year , 14.8 were uncertain how they were infected with the virus .
education still - or again - a problem according to the thursday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- paper , germany 's federal center for health education said that many europeans believe that aids now primarily affects only developing countries .
younger generations have missed out on the awareness programs of the 1990s , the paper wrote .
the center said that less than 40 percent of the german population considers aids a dangerous disease .
" we may end up gambling away what we what we achieved in education during the ' 90s , " elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , told the faz .

president bush said the greatest producers of harmful emissions would agree on common goals by late 2008 .
dw 's rolf wenkel was unimpressed . to put it bluntly : the washed-up inhabitant of the white house has n't learned a thing .
this time , too , his ideas are far behind those of the german g8 presidency - and of the international community to set a decisive course against the threatening climate catastrophe .
in heiligendamm , german chancellor angela merkel wants to move the eight leading industrial countries toward binding maximum limits for greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- at most .
to reach that goal , worldwide carbon dioxide emissions would have to fall by 50 percent by 2050 compared to the level in 1990 .
however , the biggest co2 emitter on earth continues to avoid responsibility : thus bush proposes that the united states should only start to draft long-term aims to reduce co2 emissions in the autumn .
each government would then decide for itself how to achieve these aims .
allegedly , china and india , which are merely onlookers at the g8 summit , have already signaled their agreement .
that may be the case .
still , bush , who has been a failure on every level of policy , is offering nothing more than a new spin on an old strategy .
he staves off the international community until fall , with a single press conference debases all the resolutions on the issue prepared for heiligendamm , and , as he has for years , trusts us industry , with its technological edge , to set things straight - the main thing being that economic growth is healthy .
bush appears to be blind .
he 's blind to the 13 us states that combined their efforts in a climate protection initiative .
he 's blind to the innumerable us cities that have long been ignoring the brakesman in the white house .
he 's blind to companies like general electric or general motors that want to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent .
who still takes this man seriously ?
in an initial appraisal , merkel described the president 's initiative as an " important statement " ahead of the meeting in heiligendamm .
what else could she do ?
the rug is being pulled out from under her feet , 12 months of hard bilateral and multilateral negotiations on climate protection may have been wasted , but still , merkel has to remain diplomatic .
she faces a pile of broken glass .
but she did n't cause the damage .
rather , it was a provincial politician from texas , who has long imagined he knows something about world politics .

last year , the registered number of new infections rose by four percent . according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , germany 's premier scientific research and public health agency , there were 2,611 new hiv infections registered in 2006 .
that is a four-percent rise over the previous year , and the highest increase since new infections specifically began being logged in 1993 .
in its " epidemiological bulletin , " rki reported that the number of registered , newly diagnosed hiv infections had thereby risen 81 percent since 2001 .
however , the institute noted that one reason for that major increase is better methods of detecting and documenting infections .
with that adjustment , the rki estimated that the number of actual new infections between 2001 and 2006 rose by around 40 percent .
while big cities still show a high number of registered new infections , the greatest number was seen in smaller towns of 100,000 people or less .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection and documentation have improved that increase was found among homosexual and heterosexual people alike .
also , northern and southern german states were affected most , while the number of registered new infections stagnated or dropped in central and eastern states .
initial diagnoses highest among the middle-aged also the greatest number of initial diagnoses was found among 40- to 60-year-olds .
the group with the greatest number of reported new infections remains homosexual men - at 52 percent ; heterosexuals compose 14.6 percent of the people who registered infections for the first time in 2006 .
women made up 19 percent .
the institute reported that 11 children were born with hiv last year in germany ; in seven of the cases , the mothers had not been tested for the virus .
proper medical , pre-natal care can often prevent a mother-to-child transmission of hiv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children with hiv are abandoned among the 2,611 people reported with new infections last year , 14.8 were uncertain how they were infected with the virus .
education still - or again - a problem according to the thursday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- paper , germany 's federal center for health education said that many europeans believe that aids now primarily affects only developing countries .
younger generations have missed out on the awareness programs of the 1990s , the paper wrote .
the center said that less than 40 percent of the german population considers aids a dangerous disease .
" we may end up gambling away what we what we achieved in education during the ' 90s , " elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , told the faz .

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .
in remarks to the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , the us president rejected speculation that disagreement between officials working on a climate change text for approval at the g8 meeting had soured us-german relations .
the full text of the interview was to be published saturday .
special responsibility in his remarks to the ftd , barroso said the us had " special responsibility as a large emitter of pollutants . "
" it is clear that we need a more ambitious position from the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso did n't mince words barroso 's strong criticism follows merkel 's cautious welcome to the bush initiative .
speaking thursday , merkel said bush 's speech represented " movement " on the previous uncompromising us position on setting greenhouse gas emission targets and an " important step on the road to heiligendamm . "
barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .
" but market mechanisms only work when one has binding targets . "
he expressed the hope the us would see the need to bring the united nations into the process , adding that the g8 summit should provide a launching pad for the un climate protection meeting in bali in december .
beyond bush barroso said bush 's initiative was being superceded by events within the us , where " public opinion on the issue is developing at breathtaking pace . "
noting that bush leaves office in january 2009 , the eu head expressed the hope for a " real breakthrough to the post-kyoto era in 2009 . "
the top german official preparing the ground for heiligendamm acknowledged that there was no common line on the issue .
bernd pfaffenbach said " exaggerated expectations " had been generated in the run-up to heiligendamm and did not rule out failure to reach accord on climate protection .
pfaffenbach said bush 's idea of drawing in the large industrialized countries and developing giants like india and china could " certainly make sense , " but he stressed that the german approach was to work through the un .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also waking up to a looming climate catastrophe the 1997 kyoto protocol , which calls for limited reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the industrialized world , runs out in 2012 .
the us has not ratified the treaty and demands that rapidly developing countries like china and india be brought into the process .
overestimating her influence ?
under merkel 's leadership , the eu has set ambitious targets for cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
a similar goal has been set for increasing the use of renewable energy resources .
in its leading article , the ftd said the german chancellor had overestimated her powers on the world stage following her success on the issue at an eu summit in brussels in march .
the influential newspaper predicted the g8 summit , which takes place from wednesday to friday , would mark merkel 's " greatest foreign policy defeat " to date at the hands of bush . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a new spin on an old strategy just before the g8 summit , the us presented a strategy to fight climate change .

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .
in remarks to the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , the us president rejected speculation that disagreement between officials working on a climate change text for approval at the g8 meeting had soured us-german relations .
the full text of the interview was to be published saturday .
special responsibility in his remarks to the ftd , barroso said the us had " special responsibility as a large emitter of pollutants . "
" it is clear that we need a more ambitious position from the us , " he added .

speaking thursday , merkel said bush 's speech represented " movement " on the previous uncompromising us position on setting greenhouse gas emission targets and an " important step on the road to heiligendamm . "
barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .
" but market mechanisms only work when one has binding targets . "
he expressed the hope the us would see the need to bring the united nations into the process , adding that the g8 summit should provide a launching pad for the un climate protection meeting in bali in december .
beyond bush barroso said bush 's initiative was being superceded by events within the us , where " public opinion on the issue is developing at breathtaking pace . "

the top german official preparing the ground for heiligendamm acknowledged that there was no common line on the issue .
bernd pfaffenbach said " exaggerated expectations " had been generated in the run-up to heiligendamm and did not rule out failure to reach accord on climate protection .

overestimating her influence ?
under merkel 's leadership , the eu has set ambitious targets for cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
a similar goal has been set for increasing the use of renewable energy resources .
in its leading article , the ftd said the german chancellor had overestimated her powers on the world stage following her success on the issue at an eu summit in brussels in march .

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .
in remarks to the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , the us president rejected speculation that disagreement between officials working on a climate change text for approval at the g8 meeting had soured us-german relations .

speaking thursday , merkel said bush 's speech represented " movement " on the previous uncompromising us position on setting greenhouse gas emission targets and an " important step on the road to heiligendamm . "
barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .
" but market mechanisms only work when one has binding targets . "
he expressed the hope the us would see the need to bring the united nations into the process , adding that the g8 summit should provide a launching pad for the un climate protection meeting in bali in december .

bernd pfaffenbach said " exaggerated expectations " had been generated in the run-up to heiligendamm and did not rule out failure to reach accord on climate protection .

a similar goal has been set for increasing the use of renewable energy resources .
in its leading article , the ftd said the german chancellor had overestimated her powers on the world stage following her success on the issue at an eu summit in brussels in march .

in heiligendamm , german chancellor angela merkel wants to move the eight leading industrial countries toward binding maximum limits for greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- at most .
to reach that goal , worldwide carbon dioxide emissions would have to fall by 50 percent by 2050 compared to the level in 1990 .

the increase would be about 14 per cent compared to this year .
government officials who asked not to be quoted by name told dpa news service the disclosure was meant to influence the summit , though the boost mainly fulfils commitments already given to increase aid .
merkel said the rise was the biggest of any department in the federal budget .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.06.2007 controversial dutch tv organ transplant show a hoax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ethics council said donation should be assumed if a patient does not state otherwise a dutch tv show in which patients in need of an organ transplant were to compete for a woman 's kidneys turned out to be a hoax .
german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .
germans in favor , but not donating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the form is n't hard to fill out , few germans have signed up to donate their organs organ donation in germany is voluntary and requires potential donors to carry a donor id .
an independent authority then applies a set of medical criteria to decide who receives a donor 's organs , which harvesting and transplantation strictly separated from each other .
some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "
automatic acceptance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .

german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .
germans in favor , but not donating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the form is n't hard to fill out , few germans have signed up to donate their organs organ donation in germany is voluntary and requires potential donors to carry a donor id .
an independent authority then applies a set of medical criteria to decide who receives a donor 's organs , which harvesting and transplantation strictly separated from each other .
some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "
the comments come after a bosnian serb general accused of genocide during the bosnia war from 1992-95 bosnia was delivered to the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
arrest at the border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdravko tolimir in 1996 zdravko tolimir was arrested on the border between serbia and bosnia 's serb republic in a joint operation by nato and the eu peacekeeping force eufor on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.06.2007 controversial dutch tv organ transplant show a hoax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ethics council said donation should be assumed if a patient does not state otherwise a dutch tv show in which patients in need of an organ transplant were to compete for a woman 's kidneys turned out to be a hoax .
german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .
germans in favor , but not donating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the form is n't hard to fill out , few germans have signed up to donate their organs organ donation in germany is voluntary and requires potential donors to carry a donor id .
an independent authority then applies a set of medical criteria to decide who receives a donor 's organs , which harvesting and transplantation strictly separated from each other .
some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "
automatic acceptance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .
" when a 3-year-old boy who received a liver transplant and nine months ago could n't walk wins an egg race after a long hospital stay , that 's something that moves you , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial dutch organ donor reality tv show to go ahead the dutch channel behind a reality tv show in which an organ donor must choose one of three candidates to receive her kidney has promised to broadcast it friday despite the ruckus it has caused .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "
the comments come after a bosnian serb general accused of genocide during the bosnia war from 1992-95 bosnia was delivered to the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
arrest at the border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdravko tolimir in 1996 zdravko tolimir was arrested on the border between serbia and bosnia 's serb republic in a joint operation by nato and the eu peacekeeping force eufor on thursday .
on friday , he was flown to the netherlands from the bosnian capital sarajevo .
rehn said partnerships talks were likely this month , with an exact date for talks to be set after carla del ponte , chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , returns from belgrade , where she is scheduled to travel on monday .
del ponte 's spokeswoman said the prosecutor would meet the serbian president and the prime minister and would provide the eu and the un security council with a full report on her trip .
war criminal-tracking a condition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mourning loss at a memorial center near srebrenica the eu froze the so-called " stabilization and association agreement " negotiations with serbia on joining the bloc because the balkan state was not fully cooperating with the war crimes tribunal .
this was mainly due to belgrade 's failure to hand over suspects like former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , whom experts say is still hiding in serbia .
during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .
radovan karadzic , the bosnian serb wartime political leader , and three other suspects charged with war crimes by the un tribunal also remain at large .
political motivation the eu 's decision to resume talks is seen as a political sweetener to help belgrade swallow the bitter pill of the united nations granting " supervised independence " to the ethnic albanian majority province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief un war crimes tribunal prosecutor carla del ponte serbia deeply opposes losing kosovo and its ally russia has threatened to use its un security council veto to stop that happening , but belgrade wants to reap the benefits of joining europe 's rich club .
merkel confirmed that deep divisions remained between the serbian government and the eu about the future status of kosovo .
" there are still clear divisions about kosovo , " she said .
serbian president boris tadic said belgrade insisted that granting independence to kosovo was " completely unacceptable . "

in its " epidemiological bulletin , " rki reported that the number of registered , newly diagnosed hiv infections had thereby risen 81 percent since 2001 .
however , the institute noted that one reason for that major increase is better methods of detecting and documenting infections .
with that adjustment , the rki estimated that the number of actual new infections between 2001 and 2006 rose by around 40 percent .
while big cities still show a high number of registered new infections , the greatest number was seen in smaller towns of 100,000 people or less .

women made up 19 percent .

younger generations have missed out on the awareness programs of the 1990s , the paper wrote .
the center said that less than 40 percent of the german population considers aids a dangerous disease .
" we may end up gambling away what we what we achieved in education during the ' 90s , " elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , told the faz .

explore cologne and beyond düsseldorf : stop , shop and stroll essen : a changing industrial landscape a picturesque pedal down the rhine koblenz : good for getting over jet lag regions -pipe- 01.06.2007 the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zollverein mine shaft is said to be one the world 's most beautiful call it the unromantic road .
germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .
tycoons , workers and orange bicycles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water museum each trail highlights a specific theme .
interested in social history ?
take your pick of the workers settlements route or the tycoons ' villas route .
hard-core industry more your thing ?
pick from topics like industrial heritage along the river lippe , or the westphalian coal mining trail .
in the mood for food ?
do n't miss the bread , corn and beer tour .
those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .
today the same tower , built in 1892 by august thyssen , is home to a multimedia water theme museum .
in bottrop , just northeast of oberhausen , the tetrahedron - a 50-meter filigree steel construction - rises up over a former gigantic slag heap .
the ruhr valley has something for everyone - cyclists , hikers and water sports fans will find themselves well catered for here .
set this against the monumental background of the region 's industrial history , and you have all the ingredients for an unusual and informative trip . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany home to some of europe 's dirtiest power stations germany contributed heavily to the world wildlife fund 's " dirty thirty " list of most-polluting power stations in the european union , landing six of its coal-fired plants in the top ten .

explore cologne and beyond düsseldorf : stop , shop and stroll essen : a changing industrial landscape a picturesque pedal down the rhine koblenz : good for getting over jet lag regions -pipe- 01.06.2007 the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zollverein mine shaft is said to be one the world 's most beautiful call it the unromantic road .
germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .
tycoons , workers and orange bicycles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water museum each trail highlights a specific theme .
interested in social history ?
take your pick of the workers settlements route or the tycoons ' villas route .
hard-core industry more your thing ?
pick from topics like industrial heritage along the river lippe , or the westphalian coal mining trail .
in the mood for food ?
do n't miss the bread , corn and beer tour .
those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .
today the same tower , built in 1892 by august thyssen , is home to a multimedia water theme museum .
in bottrop , just northeast of oberhausen , the tetrahedron - a 50-meter filigree steel construction - rises up over a former gigantic slag heap .

explore cologne and beyond düsseldorf : stop , shop and stroll essen : a changing industrial landscape a picturesque pedal down the rhine koblenz : good for getting over jet lag regions -pipe- 01.06.2007 the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zollverein mine shaft is said to be one the world 's most beautiful call it the unromantic road .
germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .
tycoons , workers and orange bicycles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water museum each trail highlights a specific theme .
interested in social history ?
take your pick of the workers settlements route or the tycoons ' villas route .
hard-core industry more your thing ?
pick from topics like industrial heritage along the river lippe , or the westphalian coal mining trail .
in the mood for food ?
do n't miss the bread , corn and beer tour .
those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .
today the same tower , built in 1892 by august thyssen , is home to a multimedia water theme museum .
in bottrop , just northeast of oberhausen , the tetrahedron - a 50-meter filigree steel construction - rises up over a former gigantic slag heap .
the ruhr valley has something for everyone - cyclists , hikers and water sports fans will find themselves well catered for here .

germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .
tycoons , workers and orange bicycles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water museum each trail highlights a specific theme .
interested in social history ?
take your pick of the workers settlements route or the tycoons ' villas route .
hard-core industry more your thing ?
pick from topics like industrial heritage along the river lippe , or the westphalian coal mining trail .
in the mood for food ?
do n't miss the bread , corn and beer tour .
those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .
today the same tower , built in 1892 by august thyssen , is home to a multimedia water theme museum .
in bottrop , just northeast of oberhausen , the tetrahedron - a 50-meter filigree steel construction - rises up over a former gigantic slag heap .

explore cologne and beyond düsseldorf : stop , shop and stroll essen : a changing industrial landscape a picturesque pedal down the rhine koblenz : good for getting over jet lag regions -pipe- 01.06.2007 the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zollverein mine shaft is said to be one the world 's most beautiful call it the unromantic road .
germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .
tycoons , workers and orange bicycles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water museum each trail highlights a specific theme .

the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .

explore cologne and beyond düsseldorf : stop , shop and stroll essen : a changing industrial landscape a picturesque pedal down the rhine koblenz : good for getting over jet lag regions -pipe- 01.06.2007 the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zollverein mine shaft is said to be one the world 's most beautiful call it the unromantic road .
germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .
tycoons , workers and orange bicycles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water museum each trail highlights a specific theme .
interested in social history ?
take your pick of the workers settlements route or the tycoons ' villas route .
hard-core industry more your thing ?
pick from topics like industrial heritage along the river lippe , or the westphalian coal mining trail .
in the mood for food ?
do n't miss the bread , corn and beer tour .
those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .
today the same tower , built in 1892 by august thyssen , is home to a multimedia water theme museum .
in bottrop , just northeast of oberhausen , the tetrahedron - a 50-meter filigree steel construction - rises up over a former gigantic slag heap .

the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .

german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .
germans in favor , but not donating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the form is n't hard to fill out , few germans have signed up to donate their organs organ donation in germany is voluntary and requires potential donors to carry a donor id .
an independent authority then applies a set of medical criteria to decide who receives a donor 's organs , which harvesting and transplantation strictly separated from each other .
some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "
the comments come after a bosnian serb general accused of genocide during the bosnia war from 1992-95 bosnia was delivered to the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
arrest at the border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdravko tolimir in 1996 zdravko tolimir was arrested on the border between serbia and bosnia 's serb republic in a joint operation by nato and the eu peacekeeping force eufor on thursday .
on friday , he was flown to the netherlands from the bosnian capital sarajevo .
rehn said partnerships talks were likely this month , with an exact date for talks to be set after carla del ponte , chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , returns from belgrade , where she is scheduled to travel on monday .
del ponte 's spokeswoman said the prosecutor would meet the serbian president and the prime minister and would provide the eu and the un security council with a full report on her trip .

this was mainly due to belgrade 's failure to hand over suspects like former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , whom experts say is still hiding in serbia .
during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .
radovan karadzic , the bosnian serb wartime political leader , and three other suspects charged with war crimes by the un tribunal also remain at large .
political motivation the eu 's decision to resume talks is seen as a political sweetener to help belgrade swallow the bitter pill of the united nations granting " supervised independence " to the ethnic albanian majority province of kosovo .

merkel confirmed that deep divisions remained between the serbian government and the eu about the future status of kosovo .
" there are still clear divisions about kosovo , " she said .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "
the comments come after a bosnian serb general accused of genocide during the bosnia war from 1992-95 bosnia was delivered to the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
arrest at the border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdravko tolimir in 1996 zdravko tolimir was arrested on the border between serbia and bosnia 's serb republic in a joint operation by nato and the eu peacekeeping force eufor on thursday .
on friday , he was flown to the netherlands from the bosnian capital sarajevo .
rehn said partnerships talks were likely this month , with an exact date for talks to be set after carla del ponte , chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , returns from belgrade , where she is scheduled to travel on monday .
del ponte 's spokeswoman said the prosecutor would meet the serbian president and the prime minister and would provide the eu and the un security council with a full report on her trip .
war criminal-tracking a condition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mourning loss at a memorial center near srebrenica the eu froze the so-called " stabilization and association agreement " negotiations with serbia on joining the bloc because the balkan state was not fully cooperating with the war crimes tribunal .
this was mainly due to belgrade 's failure to hand over suspects like former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , whom experts say is still hiding in serbia .
during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .
radovan karadzic , the bosnian serb wartime political leader , and three other suspects charged with war crimes by the un tribunal also remain at large .
political motivation the eu 's decision to resume talks is seen as a political sweetener to help belgrade swallow the bitter pill of the united nations granting " supervised independence " to the ethnic albanian majority province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief un war crimes tribunal prosecutor carla del ponte serbia deeply opposes losing kosovo and its ally russia has threatened to use its un security council veto to stop that happening , but belgrade wants to reap the benefits of joining europe 's rich club .
merkel confirmed that deep divisions remained between the serbian government and the eu about the future status of kosovo .
" there are still clear divisions about kosovo , " she said .

last year , the registered number of new infections rose by four percent . according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , germany 's premier scientific research and public health agency , there were 2,611 new hiv infections registered in 2006 .
that is a four-percent rise over the previous year , and the highest increase since new infections specifically began being logged in 1993 .
in its " epidemiological bulletin , " rki reported that the number of registered , newly diagnosed hiv infections had thereby risen 81 percent since 2001 .
however , the institute noted that one reason for that major increase is better methods of detecting and documenting infections .
with that adjustment , the rki estimated that the number of actual new infections between 2001 and 2006 rose by around 40 percent .
while big cities still show a high number of registered new infections , the greatest number was seen in smaller towns of 100,000 people or less .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection and documentation have improved that increase was found among homosexual and heterosexual people alike .
also , northern and southern german states were affected most , while the number of registered new infections stagnated or dropped in central and eastern states .

the group with the greatest number of reported new infections remains homosexual men - at 52 percent ; heterosexuals compose 14.6 percent of the people who registered infections for the first time in 2006 .
women made up 19 percent .
the institute reported that 11 children were born with hiv last year in germany ; in seven of the cases , the mothers had not been tested for the virus .

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .
in remarks to the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , the us president rejected speculation that disagreement between officials working on a climate change text for approval at the g8 meeting had soured us-german relations .
the full text of the interview was to be published saturday .
special responsibility in his remarks to the ftd , barroso said the us had " special responsibility as a large emitter of pollutants . "
" it is clear that we need a more ambitious position from the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso did n't mince words barroso 's strong criticism follows merkel 's cautious welcome to the bush initiative .
speaking thursday , merkel said bush 's speech represented " movement " on the previous uncompromising us position on setting greenhouse gas emission targets and an " important step on the road to heiligendamm . "
barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .
" but market mechanisms only work when one has binding targets . "
he expressed the hope the us would see the need to bring the united nations into the process , adding that the g8 summit should provide a launching pad for the un climate protection meeting in bali in december .
beyond bush barroso said bush 's initiative was being superceded by events within the us , where " public opinion on the issue is developing at breathtaking pace . "
noting that bush leaves office in january 2009 , the eu head expressed the hope for a " real breakthrough to the post-kyoto era in 2009 . "
the top german official preparing the ground for heiligendamm acknowledged that there was no common line on the issue .
bernd pfaffenbach said " exaggerated expectations " had been generated in the run-up to heiligendamm and did not rule out failure to reach accord on climate protection .
pfaffenbach said bush 's idea of drawing in the large industrialized countries and developing giants like india and china could " certainly make sense , " but he stressed that the german approach was to work through the un .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also waking up to a looming climate catastrophe the 1997 kyoto protocol , which calls for limited reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the industrialized world , runs out in 2012 .

overestimating her influence ?
under merkel 's leadership , the eu has set ambitious targets for cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
a similar goal has been set for increasing the use of renewable energy resources .
in its leading article , the ftd said the german chancellor had overestimated her powers on the world stage following her success on the issue at an eu summit in brussels in march .

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .
in remarks to the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , the us president rejected speculation that disagreement between officials working on a climate change text for approval at the g8 meeting had soured us-german relations .
the full text of the interview was to be published saturday .
special responsibility in his remarks to the ftd , barroso said the us had " special responsibility as a large emitter of pollutants . "
" it is clear that we need a more ambitious position from the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso did n't mince words barroso 's strong criticism follows merkel 's cautious welcome to the bush initiative .
speaking thursday , merkel said bush 's speech represented " movement " on the previous uncompromising us position on setting greenhouse gas emission targets and an " important step on the road to heiligendamm . "
barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .
" but market mechanisms only work when one has binding targets . "
he expressed the hope the us would see the need to bring the united nations into the process , adding that the g8 summit should provide a launching pad for the un climate protection meeting in bali in december .

the top german official preparing the ground for heiligendamm acknowledged that there was no common line on the issue .
bernd pfaffenbach said " exaggerated expectations " had been generated in the run-up to heiligendamm and did not rule out failure to reach accord on climate protection .
pfaffenbach said bush 's idea of drawing in the large industrialized countries and developing giants like india and china could " certainly make sense , " but he stressed that the german approach was to work through the un .

under merkel 's leadership , the eu has set ambitious targets for cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
a similar goal has been set for increasing the use of renewable energy resources .
in its leading article , the ftd said the german chancellor had overestimated her powers on the world stage following her success on the issue at an eu summit in brussels in march .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "
the comments come after a bosnian serb general accused of genocide during the bosnia war from 1992-95 bosnia was delivered to the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
arrest at the border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdravko tolimir in 1996 zdravko tolimir was arrested on the border between serbia and bosnia 's serb republic in a joint operation by nato and the eu peacekeeping force eufor on thursday .
on friday , he was flown to the netherlands from the bosnian capital sarajevo .
rehn said partnerships talks were likely this month , with an exact date for talks to be set after carla del ponte , chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , returns from belgrade , where she is scheduled to travel on monday .
del ponte 's spokeswoman said the prosecutor would meet the serbian president and the prime minister and would provide the eu and the un security council with a full report on her trip .
war criminal-tracking a condition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mourning loss at a memorial center near srebrenica the eu froze the so-called " stabilization and association agreement " negotiations with serbia on joining the bloc because the balkan state was not fully cooperating with the war crimes tribunal .
this was mainly due to belgrade 's failure to hand over suspects like former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , whom experts say is still hiding in serbia .
during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .
radovan karadzic , the bosnian serb wartime political leader , and three other suspects charged with war crimes by the un tribunal also remain at large .
political motivation the eu 's decision to resume talks is seen as a political sweetener to help belgrade swallow the bitter pill of the united nations granting " supervised independence " to the ethnic albanian majority province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief un war crimes tribunal prosecutor carla del ponte serbia deeply opposes losing kosovo and its ally russia has threatened to use its un security council veto to stop that happening , but belgrade wants to reap the benefits of joining europe 's rich club .
merkel confirmed that deep divisions remained between the serbian government and the eu about the future status of kosovo .
" there are still clear divisions about kosovo , " she said .
serbian president boris tadic said belgrade insisted that granting independence to kosovo was " completely unacceptable . "
he added , however , that " there is still a lot of room to maneuver in negotiations in the hope of finding a compromise .

on the contrary , the altmühl valley is one of the most diverse regions in germany . the altmühl valley , which is germany 's largest natural park , was created in 1969 with the aim of protecting a rich landscape of natural delights and picturesque little towns such as the regional capital , eichstätt , dating back centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is dotted with old castles for nature-lovers , the best way to get around is by foot or bicycle , and with 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- of idyllic bike tracks meandering through the region , there are many routes to choose from . the typical altmühl landscape consists of lush forests and gently rolling hills , dotted with juniper bushes and clusters of rocks . one bike tour passes through picturesque little towns and villages , including essing which , set at the foot of high limestone cliffs , is one of the most popular images in the region .
also well worth a visit are berching and greding , which still have the look of medieval towns , and beilngries , famous for its pitched roofs and baroque facades decorated with coats of arms . traces of times gone by perched high on the top of craggy rocks are formidable old castles which offer their visitors the chance to sample opulent banquets of ancient fare and try their hand at medieval games such as were once the pastime of knights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the limes , the ultimate northern border in the roman empire there are also signs of the celts and the romans .

"

on the contrary , the altmühl valley is one of the most diverse regions in germany . the altmühl valley , which is germany 's largest natural park , was created in 1969 with the aim of protecting a rich landscape of natural delights and picturesque little towns such as the regional capital , eichstätt , dating back centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is dotted with old castles for nature-lovers , the best way to get around is by foot or bicycle , and with 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- of idyllic bike tracks meandering through the region , there are many routes to choose from . the typical altmühl landscape consists of lush forests and gently rolling hills , dotted with juniper bushes and clusters of rocks . one bike tour passes through picturesque little towns and villages , including essing which , set at the foot of high limestone cliffs , is one of the most popular images in the region .

dw-world.de makes a first excursion through the region from celle to luneburg to hanover and wolfsbuettel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half-timbered house in celle around 500 half-timbered houses from the 16th-18th centuries set the tone in celle 's historic city center , half an hour north of hanover by car .
surrounded by extensive moors , the region around celle is a nice spot for walks or bike rides , leading through the lowlands and wide fields to luneburg .
impressive house gables characterize the 1,000 year old hanseatic town of lüneburg , telling the stories of the former wealth of the citizens .
today , the salt factory , once luneburg 's most important source of revenue , has been transformed into the german salt museum .
the area surrounding both luneburg and celle is well-known for its lush heath that is covered in purple flowers during the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celle palace duke otto ii of brunswik-luneburg founded celle , now home to 73,000 people , in 1292 , the year his palace was built upon which the town was oriented .
as celle was not a target for extensive destruction during the world wars , many historical buildings have been preserved .
biblical inscriptions people carved into the balconies of their houses remain from the time of the reformation , which had already reached the city in 1527 .
baroque glory visitors can climb the 234 steps into the tower of the town church to get a view of the tranquil town from above .

dw-world.de makes a first excursion through the region from celle to luneburg to hanover and wolfsbuettel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half-timbered house in celle around 500 half-timbered houses from the 16th-18th centuries set the tone in celle 's historic city center , half an hour north of hanover by car .
surrounded by extensive moors , the region around celle is a nice spot for walks or bike rides , leading through the lowlands and wide fields to luneburg .
impressive house gables characterize the 1,000 year old hanseatic town of lüneburg , telling the stories of the former wealth of the citizens .
today , the salt factory , once luneburg 's most important source of revenue , has been transformed into the german salt museum .
the area surrounding both luneburg and celle is well-known for its lush heath that is covered in purple flowers during the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celle palace duke otto ii of brunswik-luneburg founded celle , now home to 73,000 people , in 1292 , the year his palace was built upon which the town was oriented .
as celle was not a target for extensive destruction during the world wars , many historical buildings have been preserved .
biblical inscriptions people carved into the balconies of their houses remain from the time of the reformation , which had already reached the city in 1527 .
baroque glory visitors can climb the 234 steps into the tower of the town church to get a view of the tranquil town from above .

in the region 's slate quarries , traces of the earth 's history lay visibly open .
rock layers of greywacke , shale , lime deposits and iron make up the mountain relief ; layers of dolerite are evidence of primeval volcanism .
a guided tour is informative and highly recommended . one of the franconian forest 's most famous cultural attractions is lauenstein castle , which has sections dating back to the 12th century .
the castle museum depicts how the ruling margrave lived in the middle ages .
on the tour of the grounds , there are still secret passageways to be " discovered .

surrounded by extensive moors , the region around celle is a nice spot for walks or bike rides , leading through the lowlands and wide fields to luneburg .
impressive house gables characterize the 1,000 year old hanseatic town of lüneburg , telling the stories of the former wealth of the citizens .
today , the salt factory , once luneburg 's most important source of revenue , has been transformed into the german salt museum .
the area surrounding both luneburg and celle is well-known for its lush heath that is covered in purple flowers during the summer .

as celle was not a target for extensive destruction during the world wars , many historical buildings have been preserved .
biblical inscriptions people carved into the balconies of their houses remain from the time of the reformation , which had already reached the city in 1527 .

a bronze lion at burgplatz recalls his reign , as does dankwarderode , the romanesque palace he had built 1173 , one of the few old town buildings to survive world war ii bombing .
legend has it that the scratch marks on the door to braunschweig cathedral , adjacent to dankwarderode palace , were made by a lion that heinrich had saved during a pilgrimage and brought home .
in reality , heinrich took back to braunschweig strong impressions from his journeys which , among others things , inspired him to have the cathedral 's interior decked out with paintings from byzantium .

dw-world.de makes a first excursion through the region from celle to luneburg to hanover and wolfsbuettel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half-timbered house in celle around 500 half-timbered houses from the 16th-18th centuries set the tone in celle 's historic city center , half an hour north of hanover by car .
surrounded by extensive moors , the region around celle is a nice spot for walks or bike rides , leading through the lowlands and wide fields to luneburg .
impressive house gables characterize the 1,000 year old hanseatic town of lüneburg , telling the stories of the former wealth of the citizens .
today , the salt factory , once luneburg 's most important source of revenue , has been transformed into the german salt museum .
the area surrounding both luneburg and celle is well-known for its lush heath that is covered in purple flowers during the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celle palace duke otto ii of brunswik-luneburg founded celle , now home to 73,000 people , in 1292 , the year his palace was built upon which the town was oriented .
as celle was not a target for extensive destruction during the world wars , many historical buildings have been preserved .
biblical inscriptions people carved into the balconies of their houses remain from the time of the reformation , which had already reached the city in 1527 .
baroque glory visitors can climb the 234 steps into the tower of the town church to get a view of the tranquil town from above .
inside the church , the sumptuous stucco works with figures and motives of plants stand-out as an unusual amount of decoration for a protestant church .
the last duke , george william , was a great fan of the baroque and commissioned an italian artist to decorate the church accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal gardens of herrenhausen in hanover but the nobility did n't always have the funds available for such impressive decoration .
instead they hired craftsmen to make fakes : wolfenbuettel palace , a half-timbered house , looks like a stone building ; the alleged marble columns in university of goettingen 's festival room are made of wood and the sculptures in the herrenhausen gardens in hanover were formed from sandstone instead of marble .
nevertheless , the gardens , one of a few remained baroque annexes in germany , are well worth an excursion .
heinrich the lion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunschweig city center thanks to its central location , heinrich the lion settled in braunschweig , around 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- east of hanover .
a bronze lion at burgplatz recalls his reign , as does dankwarderode , the romanesque palace he had built 1173 , one of the few old town buildings to survive world war ii bombing .
legend has it that the scratch marks on the door to braunschweig cathedral , adjacent to dankwarderode palace , were made by a lion that heinrich had saved during a pilgrimage and brought home .
in reality , heinrich took back to braunschweig strong impressions from his journeys which , among others things , inspired him to have the cathedral 's interior decked out with paintings from byzantium .
a copy of heinrich the lion 's illustrated bible is on view in the church - heinrich did n't know how to read .
the herzog august library in neighboring wolfenbuettel has the original as part of its collection of handwritten books , the largest in northern germany , where visitors can marvel at 500,000 books from before 1850 alone . dw staff -lrb- nak -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trier : romans , princes and tourists " roma secunda " , the second rome : that 's what trier was called during the second and third centuries .

" german aid spending will rise by about 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in 2008 , " merkel told the friday edition of german mass-circulation bild tabloid .
the increase would be about 14 per cent compared to this year .
government officials who asked not to be quoted by name told dpa news service the disclosure was meant to influence the summit , though the boost mainly fulfils commitments already given to increase aid .
merkel said the rise was the biggest of any department in the federal budget .
germany 's 2007 aid budget was about 4.5 billion euros .
" money is n't everything " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel expects recipients to use the money wisely but merkel added that increasing development aid was n't the only thing that had to happen .
" money is n't everything , " merkel said .
" you could pump a vast amount of money into africa and do the completely wrong things with it .
" we have to be partners who are equal in standing , with rights , but also with duties , " she said .
" the money has to get through to the people and really improve things .
that does not always happen . "
more aid to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the aid will continue in coming years heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , germany 's minister for economic cooperation and development , told the friday edition of süddeutsche zeitung that similar top-ups of 750 million euros would follow in the years 2009 to 2011 for a total boost of 3 billion euros .
" it is meant as a signal to the other g8 countries , " she said .
" everyone has to realize that africa 's problems will spread here if we do n't help fix them at source . "
at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , the industrialized nations agreed to gradually boost foreign aid spending to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2015 .
they must reach 0.51 per cent by 2010 .
currently germany only spends 0.36 per cent of gdp on aid . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel sets g8 agenda , doubts concrete results climate change , development aid and hedge-fund transparency would top the agenda at the g8 summit on june 6-8 , said chancellor angela merkel thursday , but she was n't confident that much progress would be made .

" the deciding thing is that the conference takes place and that it takes place without disruption . " security officials said between 16,000 and 17,000 police would be on duty during the summit . the social democratic party 's spokesman for domestic affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , told the online netzeitung the court 's ruling was " oversized " and added that the german constitutional court should be open to an appeal from demonstration organizers and that politicians needed to reevaluate the importance of such summits .

dw 's rolf wenkel was unimpressed . to put it bluntly : the washed-up inhabitant of the white house has n't learned a thing .
this time , too , his ideas are far behind those of the german g8 presidency - and of the international community to set a decisive course against the threatening climate catastrophe .
in heiligendamm , german chancellor angela merkel wants to move the eight leading industrial countries toward binding maximum limits for greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- at most .
to reach that goal , worldwide carbon dioxide emissions would have to fall by 50 percent by 2050 compared to the level in 1990 .
however , the biggest co2 emitter on earth continues to avoid responsibility : thus bush proposes that the united states should only start to draft long-term aims to reduce co2 emissions in the autumn .
each government would then decide for itself how to achieve these aims .
allegedly , china and india , which are merely onlookers at the g8 summit , have already signaled their agreement .
that may be the case .
still , bush , who has been a failure on every level of policy , is offering nothing more than a new spin on an old strategy .
he staves off the international community until fall , with a single press conference debases all the resolutions on the issue prepared for heiligendamm , and , as he has for years , trusts us industry , with its technological edge , to set things straight - the main thing being that economic growth is healthy .
bush appears to be blind .
he 's blind to the 13 us states that combined their efforts in a climate protection initiative .
he 's blind to the innumerable us cities that have long been ignoring the brakesman in the white house .
he 's blind to companies like general electric or general motors that want to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent .
who still takes this man seriously ?
in an initial appraisal , merkel described the president 's initiative as an " important statement " ahead of the meeting in heiligendamm .
what else could she do ?
the rug is being pulled out from under her feet , 12 months of hard bilateral and multilateral negotiations on climate protection may have been wasted , but still , merkel has to remain diplomatic .
she faces a pile of broken glass .

" german aid spending will rise by about 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in 2008 , " merkel told the friday edition of german mass-circulation bild tabloid .
the increase would be about 14 per cent compared to this year .
government officials who asked not to be quoted by name told dpa news service the disclosure was meant to influence the summit , though the boost mainly fulfils commitments already given to increase aid .
merkel said the rise was the biggest of any department in the federal budget .
germany 's 2007 aid budget was about 4.5 billion euros .
" money is n't everything " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel expects recipients to use the money wisely but merkel added that increasing development aid was n't the only thing that had to happen .
" money is n't everything , " merkel said .
" you could pump a vast amount of money into africa and do the completely wrong things with it .
" we have to be partners who are equal in standing , with rights , but also with duties , " she said .
" the money has to get through to the people and really improve things .
that does not always happen . "

" it is meant as a signal to the other g8 countries , " she said .
" everyone has to realize that africa 's problems will spread here if we do n't help fix them at source . "
at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , the industrialized nations agreed to gradually boost foreign aid spending to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2015 .
they must reach 0.51 per cent by 2010 .

president bush said the greatest producers of harmful emissions would agree on common goals by late 2008 .
dw 's rolf wenkel was unimpressed . to put it bluntly : the washed-up inhabitant of the white house has n't learned a thing .
this time , too , his ideas are far behind those of the german g8 presidency - and of the international community to set a decisive course against the threatening climate catastrophe .
in heiligendamm , german chancellor angela merkel wants to move the eight leading industrial countries toward binding maximum limits for greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- at most .
to reach that goal , worldwide carbon dioxide emissions would have to fall by 50 percent by 2050 compared to the level in 1990 .
however , the biggest co2 emitter on earth continues to avoid responsibility : thus bush proposes that the united states should only start to draft long-term aims to reduce co2 emissions in the autumn .
each government would then decide for itself how to achieve these aims .
allegedly , china and india , which are merely onlookers at the g8 summit , have already signaled their agreement .
that may be the case .

" german aid spending will rise by about 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in 2008 , " merkel told the friday edition of german mass-circulation bild tabloid .
the increase would be about 14 per cent compared to this year .
government officials who asked not to be quoted by name told dpa news service the disclosure was meant to influence the summit , though the boost mainly fulfils commitments already given to increase aid .
merkel said the rise was the biggest of any department in the federal budget .
germany 's 2007 aid budget was about 4.5 billion euros .
" money is n't everything " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel expects recipients to use the money wisely but merkel added that increasing development aid was n't the only thing that had to happen .
" money is n't everything , " merkel said .
" you could pump a vast amount of money into africa and do the completely wrong things with it .
" we have to be partners who are equal in standing , with rights , but also with duties , " she said .
" the money has to get through to the people and really improve things .
that does not always happen . "
more aid to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the aid will continue in coming years heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , germany 's minister for economic cooperation and development , told the friday edition of süddeutsche zeitung that similar top-ups of 750 million euros would follow in the years 2009 to 2011 for a total boost of 3 billion euros .
" it is meant as a signal to the other g8 countries , " she said .
" everyone has to realize that africa 's problems will spread here if we do n't help fix them at source . "
at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , the industrialized nations agreed to gradually boost foreign aid spending to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2015 .
they must reach 0.51 per cent by 2010 .
currently germany only spends 0.36 per cent of gdp on aid . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel sets g8 agenda , doubts concrete results climate change , development aid and hedge-fund transparency would top the agenda at the g8 summit on june 6-8 , said chancellor angela merkel thursday , but she was n't confident that much progress would be made .

last year , the registered number of new infections rose by four percent . according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , germany 's premier scientific research and public health agency , there were 2,611 new hiv infections registered in 2006 .
that is a four-percent rise over the previous year , and the highest increase since new infections specifically began being logged in 1993 .
in its " epidemiological bulletin , " rki reported that the number of registered , newly diagnosed hiv infections had thereby risen 81 percent since 2001 .
however , the institute noted that one reason for that major increase is better methods of detecting and documenting infections .
with that adjustment , the rki estimated that the number of actual new infections between 2001 and 2006 rose by around 40 percent .
while big cities still show a high number of registered new infections , the greatest number was seen in smaller towns of 100,000 people or less .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection and documentation have improved that increase was found among homosexual and heterosexual people alike .
also , northern and southern german states were affected most , while the number of registered new infections stagnated or dropped in central and eastern states .
initial diagnoses highest among the middle-aged also the greatest number of initial diagnoses was found among 40- to 60-year-olds .
the group with the greatest number of reported new infections remains homosexual men - at 52 percent ; heterosexuals compose 14.6 percent of the people who registered infections for the first time in 2006 .
women made up 19 percent .
the institute reported that 11 children were born with hiv last year in germany ; in seven of the cases , the mothers had not been tested for the virus .
proper medical , pre-natal care can often prevent a mother-to-child transmission of hiv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children with hiv are abandoned among the 2,611 people reported with new infections last year , 14.8 were uncertain how they were infected with the virus .
education still - or again - a problem according to the thursday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- paper , germany 's federal center for health education said that many europeans believe that aids now primarily affects only developing countries .
younger generations have missed out on the awareness programs of the 1990s , the paper wrote .
the center said that less than 40 percent of the german population considers aids a dangerous disease .
" we may end up gambling away what we what we achieved in education during the ' 90s , " elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , told the faz .

" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "

some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "
the comments come after a bosnian serb general accused of genocide during the bosnia war from 1992-95 bosnia was delivered to the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
arrest at the border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdravko tolimir in 1996 zdravko tolimir was arrested on the border between serbia and bosnia 's serb republic in a joint operation by nato and the eu peacekeeping force eufor on thursday .
on friday , he was flown to the netherlands from the bosnian capital sarajevo .
rehn said partnerships talks were likely this month , with an exact date for talks to be set after carla del ponte , chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , returns from belgrade , where she is scheduled to travel on monday .
del ponte 's spokeswoman said the prosecutor would meet the serbian president and the prime minister and would provide the eu and the un security council with a full report on her trip .
war criminal-tracking a condition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mourning loss at a memorial center near srebrenica the eu froze the so-called " stabilization and association agreement " negotiations with serbia on joining the bloc because the balkan state was not fully cooperating with the war crimes tribunal .
this was mainly due to belgrade 's failure to hand over suspects like former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , whom experts say is still hiding in serbia .
during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .
radovan karadzic , the bosnian serb wartime political leader , and three other suspects charged with war crimes by the un tribunal also remain at large .
political motivation the eu 's decision to resume talks is seen as a political sweetener to help belgrade swallow the bitter pill of the united nations granting " supervised independence " to the ethnic albanian majority province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief un war crimes tribunal prosecutor carla del ponte serbia deeply opposes losing kosovo and its ally russia has threatened to use its un security council veto to stop that happening , but belgrade wants to reap the benefits of joining europe 's rich club .
merkel confirmed that deep divisions remained between the serbian government and the eu about the future status of kosovo .
" there are still clear divisions about kosovo , " she said .
serbian president boris tadic said belgrade insisted that granting independence to kosovo was " completely unacceptable . "
he added , however , that " there is still a lot of room to maneuver in negotiations in the hope of finding a compromise .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "
the comments come after a bosnian serb general accused of genocide during the bosnia war from 1992-95 bosnia was delivered to the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
arrest at the border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdravko tolimir in 1996 zdravko tolimir was arrested on the border between serbia and bosnia 's serb republic in a joint operation by nato and the eu peacekeeping force eufor on thursday .
on friday , he was flown to the netherlands from the bosnian capital sarajevo .
rehn said partnerships talks were likely this month , with an exact date for talks to be set after carla del ponte , chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , returns from belgrade , where she is scheduled to travel on monday .
del ponte 's spokeswoman said the prosecutor would meet the serbian president and the prime minister and would provide the eu and the un security council with a full report on her trip .
war criminal-tracking a condition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mourning loss at a memorial center near srebrenica the eu froze the so-called " stabilization and association agreement " negotiations with serbia on joining the bloc because the balkan state was not fully cooperating with the war crimes tribunal .
this was mainly due to belgrade 's failure to hand over suspects like former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , whom experts say is still hiding in serbia .
during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .
radovan karadzic , the bosnian serb wartime political leader , and three other suspects charged with war crimes by the un tribunal also remain at large .
political motivation the eu 's decision to resume talks is seen as a political sweetener to help belgrade swallow the bitter pill of the united nations granting " supervised independence " to the ethnic albanian majority province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief un war crimes tribunal prosecutor carla del ponte serbia deeply opposes losing kosovo and its ally russia has threatened to use its un security council veto to stop that happening , but belgrade wants to reap the benefits of joining europe 's rich club .
merkel confirmed that deep divisions remained between the serbian government and the eu about the future status of kosovo .
" there are still clear divisions about kosovo , " she said .
serbian president boris tadic said belgrade insisted that granting independence to kosovo was " completely unacceptable . "

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .
in remarks to the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , the us president rejected speculation that disagreement between officials working on a climate change text for approval at the g8 meeting had soured us-german relations .
the full text of the interview was to be published saturday .
special responsibility in his remarks to the ftd , barroso said the us had " special responsibility as a large emitter of pollutants . "
" it is clear that we need a more ambitious position from the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso did n't mince words barroso 's strong criticism follows merkel 's cautious welcome to the bush initiative .
speaking thursday , merkel said bush 's speech represented " movement " on the previous uncompromising us position on setting greenhouse gas emission targets and an " important step on the road to heiligendamm . "
barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .
" but market mechanisms only work when one has binding targets . "
he expressed the hope the us would see the need to bring the united nations into the process , adding that the g8 summit should provide a launching pad for the un climate protection meeting in bali in december .
beyond bush barroso said bush 's initiative was being superceded by events within the us , where " public opinion on the issue is developing at breathtaking pace . "
noting that bush leaves office in january 2009 , the eu head expressed the hope for a " real breakthrough to the post-kyoto era in 2009 . "
the top german official preparing the ground for heiligendamm acknowledged that there was no common line on the issue .
bernd pfaffenbach said " exaggerated expectations " had been generated in the run-up to heiligendamm and did not rule out failure to reach accord on climate protection .
pfaffenbach said bush 's idea of drawing in the large industrialized countries and developing giants like india and china could " certainly make sense , " but he stressed that the german approach was to work through the un .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also waking up to a looming climate catastrophe the 1997 kyoto protocol , which calls for limited reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the industrialized world , runs out in 2012 .
the us has not ratified the treaty and demands that rapidly developing countries like china and india be brought into the process .
overestimating her influence ?
under merkel 's leadership , the eu has set ambitious targets for cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
a similar goal has been set for increasing the use of renewable energy resources .
in its leading article , the ftd said the german chancellor had overestimated her powers on the world stage following her success on the issue at an eu summit in brussels in march .
the influential newspaper predicted the g8 summit , which takes place from wednesday to friday , would mark merkel 's " greatest foreign policy defeat " to date at the hands of bush . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a new spin on an old strategy just before the g8 summit , the us presented a strategy to fight climate change .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "
the comments come after a bosnian serb general accused of genocide during the bosnia war from 1992-95 bosnia was delivered to the war crimes tribunal in the hague .

on friday , he was flown to the netherlands from the bosnian capital sarajevo .
rehn said partnerships talks were likely this month , with an exact date for talks to be set after carla del ponte , chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , returns from belgrade , where she is scheduled to travel on monday .
del ponte 's spokeswoman said the prosecutor would meet the serbian president and the prime minister and would provide the eu and the un security council with a full report on her trip .

this was mainly due to belgrade 's failure to hand over suspects like former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , whom experts say is still hiding in serbia .
during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .
radovan karadzic , the bosnian serb wartime political leader , and three other suspects charged with war crimes by the un tribunal also remain at large .

merkel confirmed that deep divisions remained between the serbian government and the eu about the future status of kosovo .
" there are still clear divisions about kosovo , " she said .
serbian president boris tadic said belgrade insisted that granting independence to kosovo was " completely unacceptable . "

last year , the registered number of new infections rose by four percent . according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , germany 's premier scientific research and public health agency , there were 2,611 new hiv infections registered in 2006 .
that is a four-percent rise over the previous year , and the highest increase since new infections specifically began being logged in 1993 .
in its " epidemiological bulletin , " rki reported that the number of registered , newly diagnosed hiv infections had thereby risen 81 percent since 2001 .
however , the institute noted that one reason for that major increase is better methods of detecting and documenting infections .
with that adjustment , the rki estimated that the number of actual new infections between 2001 and 2006 rose by around 40 percent .
while big cities still show a high number of registered new infections , the greatest number was seen in smaller towns of 100,000 people or less .

the group with the greatest number of reported new infections remains homosexual men - at 52 percent ; heterosexuals compose 14.6 percent of the people who registered infections for the first time in 2006 .
women made up 19 percent .
the institute reported that 11 children were born with hiv last year in germany ; in seven of the cases , the mothers had not been tested for the virus .
proper medical , pre-natal care can often prevent a mother-to-child transmission of hiv .

the center said that less than 40 percent of the german population considers aids a dangerous disease .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "
the comments come after a bosnian serb general accused of genocide during the bosnia war from 1992-95 bosnia was delivered to the war crimes tribunal in the hague .

on friday , he was flown to the netherlands from the bosnian capital sarajevo .
rehn said partnerships talks were likely this month , with an exact date for talks to be set after carla del ponte , chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , returns from belgrade , where she is scheduled to travel on monday .

this was mainly due to belgrade 's failure to hand over suspects like former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , whom experts say is still hiding in serbia .
during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .
radovan karadzic , the bosnian serb wartime political leader , and three other suspects charged with war crimes by the un tribunal also remain at large .

merkel confirmed that deep divisions remained between the serbian government and the eu about the future status of kosovo .
" there are still clear divisions about kosovo , " she said .

" german aid spending will rise by about 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in 2008 , " merkel told the friday edition of german mass-circulation bild tabloid .
the increase would be about 14 per cent compared to this year .
government officials who asked not to be quoted by name told dpa news service the disclosure was meant to influence the summit , though the boost mainly fulfils commitments already given to increase aid .
merkel said the rise was the biggest of any department in the federal budget .
germany 's 2007 aid budget was about 4.5 billion euros .
" money is n't everything " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel expects recipients to use the money wisely but merkel added that increasing development aid was n't the only thing that had to happen .
" money is n't everything , " merkel said .
" you could pump a vast amount of money into africa and do the completely wrong things with it .
" we have to be partners who are equal in standing , with rights , but also with duties , " she said .
" the money has to get through to the people and really improve things .
that does not always happen . "
more aid to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the aid will continue in coming years heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , germany 's minister for economic cooperation and development , told the friday edition of süddeutsche zeitung that similar top-ups of 750 million euros would follow in the years 2009 to 2011 for a total boost of 3 billion euros .
" it is meant as a signal to the other g8 countries , " she said .
" everyone has to realize that africa 's problems will spread here if we do n't help fix them at source . "
at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , the industrialized nations agreed to gradually boost foreign aid spending to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2015 .
they must reach 0.51 per cent by 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 01.06.2007 opinion : a new spin on an old strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just before the g8 summit , the us presented a strategy to fight climate change .
president bush said the greatest producers of harmful emissions would agree on common goals by late 2008 .
dw 's rolf wenkel was unimpressed . to put it bluntly : the washed-up inhabitant of the white house has n't learned a thing .
this time , too , his ideas are far behind those of the german g8 presidency - and of the international community to set a decisive course against the threatening climate catastrophe .
in heiligendamm , german chancellor angela merkel wants to move the eight leading industrial countries toward binding maximum limits for greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- at most .
to reach that goal , worldwide carbon dioxide emissions would have to fall by 50 percent by 2050 compared to the level in 1990 .
however , the biggest co2 emitter on earth continues to avoid responsibility : thus bush proposes that the united states should only start to draft long-term aims to reduce co2 emissions in the autumn .
each government would then decide for itself how to achieve these aims .
allegedly , china and india , which are merely onlookers at the g8 summit , have already signaled their agreement .
that may be the case .
still , bush , who has been a failure on every level of policy , is offering nothing more than a new spin on an old strategy .
he staves off the international community until fall , with a single press conference debases all the resolutions on the issue prepared for heiligendamm , and , as he has for years , trusts us industry , with its technological edge , to set things straight - the main thing being that economic growth is healthy .
bush appears to be blind .
he 's blind to the 13 us states that combined their efforts in a climate protection initiative .
he 's blind to the innumerable us cities that have long been ignoring the brakesman in the white house .
he 's blind to companies like general electric or general motors that want to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent .
who still takes this man seriously ?
in an initial appraisal , merkel described the president 's initiative as an " important statement " ahead of the meeting in heiligendamm .
what else could she do ?
the rug is being pulled out from under her feet , 12 months of hard bilateral and multilateral negotiations on climate protection may have been wasted , but still , merkel has to remain diplomatic .
she faces a pile of broken glass .
but she did n't cause the damage .
rather , it was a provincial politician from texas , who has long imagined he knows something about world politics .

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .
in remarks to the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , the us president rejected speculation that disagreement between officials working on a climate change text for approval at the g8 meeting had soured us-german relations .
the full text of the interview was to be published saturday .
special responsibility in his remarks to the ftd , barroso said the us had " special responsibility as a large emitter of pollutants . "
" it is clear that we need a more ambitious position from the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso did n't mince words barroso 's strong criticism follows merkel 's cautious welcome to the bush initiative .
speaking thursday , merkel said bush 's speech represented " movement " on the previous uncompromising us position on setting greenhouse gas emission targets and an " important step on the road to heiligendamm . "
barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .
" but market mechanisms only work when one has binding targets . "
he expressed the hope the us would see the need to bring the united nations into the process , adding that the g8 summit should provide a launching pad for the un climate protection meeting in bali in december .
beyond bush barroso said bush 's initiative was being superceded by events within the us , where " public opinion on the issue is developing at breathtaking pace . "
noting that bush leaves office in january 2009 , the eu head expressed the hope for a " real breakthrough to the post-kyoto era in 2009 . "
the top german official preparing the ground for heiligendamm acknowledged that there was no common line on the issue .
bernd pfaffenbach said " exaggerated expectations " had been generated in the run-up to heiligendamm and did not rule out failure to reach accord on climate protection .
pfaffenbach said bush 's idea of drawing in the large industrialized countries and developing giants like india and china could " certainly make sense , " but he stressed that the german approach was to work through the un .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also waking up to a looming climate catastrophe the 1997 kyoto protocol , which calls for limited reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the industrialized world , runs out in 2012 .

under merkel 's leadership , the eu has set ambitious targets for cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
a similar goal has been set for increasing the use of renewable energy resources .
in its leading article , the ftd said the german chancellor had overestimated her powers on the world stage following her success on the issue at an eu summit in brussels in march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.06.2007 controversial dutch tv organ transplant show a hoax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ethics council said donation should be assumed if a patient does not state otherwise a dutch tv show in which patients in need of an organ transplant were to compete for a woman 's kidneys turned out to be a hoax .
german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .
germans in favor , but not donating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the form is n't hard to fill out , few germans have signed up to donate their organs organ donation in germany is voluntary and requires potential donors to carry a donor id .
an independent authority then applies a set of medical criteria to decide who receives a donor 's organs , which harvesting and transplantation strictly separated from each other .
some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "
automatic acceptance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .
" when a 3-year-old boy who received a liver transplant and nine months ago could n't walk wins an egg race after a long hospital stay , that 's something that moves you , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial dutch organ donor reality tv show to go ahead the dutch channel behind a reality tv show in which an organ donor must choose one of three candidates to receive her kidney has promised to broadcast it friday despite the ruckus it has caused .

german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .
germans in favor , but not donating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the form is n't hard to fill out , few germans have signed up to donate their organs organ donation in germany is voluntary and requires potential donors to carry a donor id .
an independent authority then applies a set of medical criteria to decide who receives a donor 's organs , which harvesting and transplantation strictly separated from each other .
some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "
automatic acceptance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .
" when a 3-year-old boy who received a liver transplant and nine months ago could n't walk wins an egg race after a long hospital stay , that 's something that moves you , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial dutch organ donor reality tv show to go ahead the dutch channel behind a reality tv show in which an organ donor must choose one of three candidates to receive her kidney has promised to broadcast it friday despite the ruckus it has caused .

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .
in remarks to the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , the us president rejected speculation that disagreement between officials working on a climate change text for approval at the g8 meeting had soured us-german relations .
the full text of the interview was to be published saturday .
special responsibility in his remarks to the ftd , barroso said the us had " special responsibility as a large emitter of pollutants . "
" it is clear that we need a more ambitious position from the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso did n't mince words barroso 's strong criticism follows merkel 's cautious welcome to the bush initiative .
speaking thursday , merkel said bush 's speech represented " movement " on the previous uncompromising us position on setting greenhouse gas emission targets and an " important step on the road to heiligendamm . "
barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .
" but market mechanisms only work when one has binding targets . "
he expressed the hope the us would see the need to bring the united nations into the process , adding that the g8 summit should provide a launching pad for the un climate protection meeting in bali in december .
beyond bush barroso said bush 's initiative was being superceded by events within the us , where " public opinion on the issue is developing at breathtaking pace . "
noting that bush leaves office in january 2009 , the eu head expressed the hope for a " real breakthrough to the post-kyoto era in 2009 . "
the top german official preparing the ground for heiligendamm acknowledged that there was no common line on the issue .
bernd pfaffenbach said " exaggerated expectations " had been generated in the run-up to heiligendamm and did not rule out failure to reach accord on climate protection .
pfaffenbach said bush 's idea of drawing in the large industrialized countries and developing giants like india and china could " certainly make sense , " but he stressed that the german approach was to work through the un .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also waking up to a looming climate catastrophe the 1997 kyoto protocol , which calls for limited reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the industrialized world , runs out in 2012 .
the us has not ratified the treaty and demands that rapidly developing countries like china and india be brought into the process .
overestimating her influence ?
under merkel 's leadership , the eu has set ambitious targets for cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
a similar goal has been set for increasing the use of renewable energy resources .
in its leading article , the ftd said the german chancellor had overestimated her powers on the world stage following her success on the issue at an eu summit in brussels in march .
the influential newspaper predicted the g8 summit , which takes place from wednesday to friday , would mark merkel 's " greatest foreign policy defeat " to date at the hands of bush . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a new spin on an old strategy just before the g8 summit , the us presented a strategy to fight climate change .

this time , too , his ideas are far behind those of the german g8 presidency - and of the international community to set a decisive course against the threatening climate catastrophe .
in heiligendamm , german chancellor angela merkel wants to move the eight leading industrial countries toward binding maximum limits for greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- at most .
to reach that goal , worldwide carbon dioxide emissions would have to fall by 50 percent by 2050 compared to the level in 1990 .
however , the biggest co2 emitter on earth continues to avoid responsibility : thus bush proposes that the united states should only start to draft long-term aims to reduce co2 emissions in the autumn .
each government would then decide for itself how to achieve these aims .
allegedly , china and india , which are merely onlookers at the g8 summit , have already signaled their agreement .
that may be the case .
still , bush , who has been a failure on every level of policy , is offering nothing more than a new spin on an old strategy .
he staves off the international community until fall , with a single press conference debases all the resolutions on the issue prepared for heiligendamm , and , as he has for years , trusts us industry , with its technological edge , to set things straight - the main thing being that economic growth is healthy .
bush appears to be blind .
he 's blind to the 13 us states that combined their efforts in a climate protection initiative .
he 's blind to the innumerable us cities that have long been ignoring the brakesman in the white house .
he 's blind to companies like general electric or general motors that want to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent .

in an initial appraisal , merkel described the president 's initiative as an " important statement " ahead of the meeting in heiligendamm .
what else could she do ?
the rug is being pulled out from under her feet , 12 months of hard bilateral and multilateral negotiations on climate protection may have been wasted , but still , merkel has to remain diplomatic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 01.06.2007 opinion : a new spin on an old strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just before the g8 summit , the us presented a strategy to fight climate change .
president bush said the greatest producers of harmful emissions would agree on common goals by late 2008 .
dw 's rolf wenkel was unimpressed . to put it bluntly : the washed-up inhabitant of the white house has n't learned a thing .
this time , too , his ideas are far behind those of the german g8 presidency - and of the international community to set a decisive course against the threatening climate catastrophe .
in heiligendamm , german chancellor angela merkel wants to move the eight leading industrial countries toward binding maximum limits for greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- at most .
to reach that goal , worldwide carbon dioxide emissions would have to fall by 50 percent by 2050 compared to the level in 1990 .
however , the biggest co2 emitter on earth continues to avoid responsibility : thus bush proposes that the united states should only start to draft long-term aims to reduce co2 emissions in the autumn .
each government would then decide for itself how to achieve these aims .
allegedly , china and india , which are merely onlookers at the g8 summit , have already signaled their agreement .
that may be the case .
still , bush , who has been a failure on every level of policy , is offering nothing more than a new spin on an old strategy .
he staves off the international community until fall , with a single press conference debases all the resolutions on the issue prepared for heiligendamm , and , as he has for years , trusts us industry , with its technological edge , to set things straight - the main thing being that economic growth is healthy .
bush appears to be blind .
he 's blind to the 13 us states that combined their efforts in a climate protection initiative .
he 's blind to the innumerable us cities that have long been ignoring the brakesman in the white house .
he 's blind to companies like general electric or general motors that want to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent .
who still takes this man seriously ?
in an initial appraisal , merkel described the president 's initiative as an " important statement " ahead of the meeting in heiligendamm .
what else could she do ?
the rug is being pulled out from under her feet , 12 months of hard bilateral and multilateral negotiations on climate protection may have been wasted , but still , merkel has to remain diplomatic .
she faces a pile of broken glass .
but she did n't cause the damage .
rather , it was a provincial politician from texas , who has long imagined he knows something about world politics .

german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "

some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .

" german aid spending will rise by about 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in 2008 , " merkel told the friday edition of german mass-circulation bild tabloid .
the increase would be about 14 per cent compared to this year .
government officials who asked not to be quoted by name told dpa news service the disclosure was meant to influence the summit , though the boost mainly fulfils commitments already given to increase aid .
merkel said the rise was the biggest of any department in the federal budget .
germany 's 2007 aid budget was about 4.5 billion euros .
" money is n't everything " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel expects recipients to use the money wisely but merkel added that increasing development aid was n't the only thing that had to happen .
" money is n't everything , " merkel said .
" you could pump a vast amount of money into africa and do the completely wrong things with it .
" we have to be partners who are equal in standing , with rights , but also with duties , " she said .
" the money has to get through to the people and really improve things .
that does not always happen . "

" it is meant as a signal to the other g8 countries , " she said .
" everyone has to realize that africa 's problems will spread here if we do n't help fix them at source . "
at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , the industrialized nations agreed to gradually boost foreign aid spending to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2015 .
they must reach 0.51 per cent by 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.06.2007 controversial dutch tv organ transplant show a hoax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ethics council said donation should be assumed if a patient does not state otherwise a dutch tv show in which patients in need of an organ transplant were to compete for a woman 's kidneys turned out to be a hoax .
german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .
germans in favor , but not donating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the form is n't hard to fill out , few germans have signed up to donate their organs organ donation in germany is voluntary and requires potential donors to carry a donor id .
an independent authority then applies a set of medical criteria to decide who receives a donor 's organs , which harvesting and transplantation strictly separated from each other .
some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "
automatic acceptance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .
" when a 3-year-old boy who received a liver transplant and nine months ago could n't walk wins an egg race after a long hospital stay , that 's something that moves you , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial dutch organ donor reality tv show to go ahead the dutch channel behind a reality tv show in which an organ donor must choose one of three candidates to receive her kidney has promised to broadcast it friday despite the ruckus it has caused .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir .

merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "

during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "
the comments come after a bosnian serb general accused of genocide during the bosnia war from 1992-95 bosnia was delivered to the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
arrest at the border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdravko tolimir in 1996 zdravko tolimir was arrested on the border between serbia and bosnia 's serb republic in a joint operation by nato and the eu peacekeeping force eufor on thursday .
on friday , he was flown to the netherlands from the bosnian capital sarajevo .
rehn said partnerships talks were likely this month , with an exact date for talks to be set after carla del ponte , chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , returns from belgrade , where she is scheduled to travel on monday .
del ponte 's spokeswoman said the prosecutor would meet the serbian president and the prime minister and would provide the eu and the un security council with a full report on her trip .

this was mainly due to belgrade 's failure to hand over suspects like former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , whom experts say is still hiding in serbia .
during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .
radovan karadzic , the bosnian serb wartime political leader , and three other suspects charged with war crimes by the un tribunal also remain at large .

merkel confirmed that deep divisions remained between the serbian government and the eu about the future status of kosovo .
" there are still clear divisions about kosovo , " she said .
serbian president boris tadic said belgrade insisted that granting independence to kosovo was " completely unacceptable . "

president bush said the greatest producers of harmful emissions would agree on common goals by late 2008 .
dw 's rolf wenkel was unimpressed . to put it bluntly : the washed-up inhabitant of the white house has n't learned a thing .
this time , too , his ideas are far behind those of the german g8 presidency - and of the international community to set a decisive course against the threatening climate catastrophe .
in heiligendamm , german chancellor angela merkel wants to move the eight leading industrial countries toward binding maximum limits for greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- at most .
to reach that goal , worldwide carbon dioxide emissions would have to fall by 50 percent by 2050 compared to the level in 1990 .
however , the biggest co2 emitter on earth continues to avoid responsibility : thus bush proposes that the united states should only start to draft long-term aims to reduce co2 emissions in the autumn .
each government would then decide for itself how to achieve these aims .
allegedly , china and india , which are merely onlookers at the g8 summit , have already signaled their agreement .
that may be the case .
still , bush , who has been a failure on every level of policy , is offering nothing more than a new spin on an old strategy .
he staves off the international community until fall , with a single press conference debases all the resolutions on the issue prepared for heiligendamm , and , as he has for years , trusts us industry , with its technological edge , to set things straight - the main thing being that economic growth is healthy .
bush appears to be blind .
he 's blind to the 13 us states that combined their efforts in a climate protection initiative .
he 's blind to the innumerable us cities that have long been ignoring the brakesman in the white house .
he 's blind to companies like general electric or general motors that want to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent .
who still takes this man seriously ?
in an initial appraisal , merkel described the president 's initiative as an " important statement " ahead of the meeting in heiligendamm .
what else could she do ?
the rug is being pulled out from under her feet , 12 months of hard bilateral and multilateral negotiations on climate protection may have been wasted , but still , merkel has to remain diplomatic .
she faces a pile of broken glass .
but she did n't cause the damage .

german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .
germans in favor , but not donating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the form is n't hard to fill out , few germans have signed up to donate their organs organ donation in germany is voluntary and requires potential donors to carry a donor id .
an independent authority then applies a set of medical criteria to decide who receives a donor 's organs , which harvesting and transplantation strictly separated from each other .
some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "
automatic acceptance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .
" when a 3-year-old boy who received a liver transplant and nine months ago could n't walk wins an egg race after a long hospital stay , that 's something that moves you , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial dutch organ donor reality tv show to go ahead the dutch channel behind a reality tv show in which an organ donor must choose one of three candidates to receive her kidney has promised to broadcast it friday despite the ruckus it has caused .

this time , too , his ideas are far behind those of the german g8 presidency - and of the international community to set a decisive course against the threatening climate catastrophe .
in heiligendamm , german chancellor angela merkel wants to move the eight leading industrial countries toward binding maximum limits for greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- at most .
to reach that goal , worldwide carbon dioxide emissions would have to fall by 50 percent by 2050 compared to the level in 1990 .

president bush said the greatest producers of harmful emissions would agree on common goals by late 2008 .
dw 's rolf wenkel was unimpressed . to put it bluntly : the washed-up inhabitant of the white house has n't learned a thing .
this time , too , his ideas are far behind those of the german g8 presidency - and of the international community to set a decisive course against the threatening climate catastrophe .
in heiligendamm , german chancellor angela merkel wants to move the eight leading industrial countries toward binding maximum limits for greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- at most .
to reach that goal , worldwide carbon dioxide emissions would have to fall by 50 percent by 2050 compared to the level in 1990 .
however , the biggest co2 emitter on earth continues to avoid responsibility : thus bush proposes that the united states should only start to draft long-term aims to reduce co2 emissions in the autumn .
each government would then decide for itself how to achieve these aims .
allegedly , china and india , which are merely onlookers at the g8 summit , have already signaled their agreement .
that may be the case .
still , bush , who has been a failure on every level of policy , is offering nothing more than a new spin on an old strategy .
he staves off the international community until fall , with a single press conference debases all the resolutions on the issue prepared for heiligendamm , and , as he has for years , trusts us industry , with its technological edge , to set things straight - the main thing being that economic growth is healthy .
bush appears to be blind .
he 's blind to the 13 us states that combined their efforts in a climate protection initiative .
he 's blind to the innumerable us cities that have long been ignoring the brakesman in the white house .
he 's blind to companies like general electric or general motors that want to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent .
who still takes this man seriously ?
in an initial appraisal , merkel described the president 's initiative as an " important statement " ahead of the meeting in heiligendamm .
what else could she do ?
the rug is being pulled out from under her feet , 12 months of hard bilateral and multilateral negotiations on climate protection may have been wasted , but still , merkel has to remain diplomatic .
she faces a pile of broken glass .
but she did n't cause the damage .
rather , it was a provincial politician from texas , who has long imagined he knows something about world politics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.06.2007 controversial dutch tv organ transplant show a hoax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ethics council said donation should be assumed if a patient does not state otherwise a dutch tv show in which patients in need of an organ transplant were to compete for a woman 's kidneys turned out to be a hoax .
german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .
germans in favor , but not donating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the form is n't hard to fill out , few germans have signed up to donate their organs organ donation in germany is voluntary and requires potential donors to carry a donor id .
an independent authority then applies a set of medical criteria to decide who receives a donor 's organs , which harvesting and transplantation strictly separated from each other .
some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "
automatic acceptance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .
" when a 3-year-old boy who received a liver transplant and nine months ago could n't walk wins an egg race after a long hospital stay , that 's something that moves you , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial dutch organ donor reality tv show to go ahead the dutch channel behind a reality tv show in which an organ donor must choose one of three candidates to receive her kidney has promised to broadcast it friday despite the ruckus it has caused .

german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .
germans in favor , but not donating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the form is n't hard to fill out , few germans have signed up to donate their organs organ donation in germany is voluntary and requires potential donors to carry a donor id .
an independent authority then applies a set of medical criteria to decide who receives a donor 's organs , which harvesting and transplantation strictly separated from each other .
some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "
automatic acceptance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .
" when a 3-year-old boy who received a liver transplant and nine months ago could n't walk wins an egg race after a long hospital stay , that 's something that moves you , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial dutch organ donor reality tv show to go ahead the dutch channel behind a reality tv show in which an organ donor must choose one of three candidates to receive her kidney has promised to broadcast it friday despite the ruckus it has caused .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "
the comments come after a bosnian serb general accused of genocide during the bosnia war from 1992-95 bosnia was delivered to the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
arrest at the border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdravko tolimir in 1996 zdravko tolimir was arrested on the border between serbia and bosnia 's serb republic in a joint operation by nato and the eu peacekeeping force eufor on thursday .
on friday , he was flown to the netherlands from the bosnian capital sarajevo .
rehn said partnerships talks were likely this month , with an exact date for talks to be set after carla del ponte , chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , returns from belgrade , where she is scheduled to travel on monday .
del ponte 's spokeswoman said the prosecutor would meet the serbian president and the prime minister and would provide the eu and the un security council with a full report on her trip .
war criminal-tracking a condition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mourning loss at a memorial center near srebrenica the eu froze the so-called " stabilization and association agreement " negotiations with serbia on joining the bloc because the balkan state was not fully cooperating with the war crimes tribunal .
this was mainly due to belgrade 's failure to hand over suspects like former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , whom experts say is still hiding in serbia .
during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .
radovan karadzic , the bosnian serb wartime political leader , and three other suspects charged with war crimes by the un tribunal also remain at large .
political motivation the eu 's decision to resume talks is seen as a political sweetener to help belgrade swallow the bitter pill of the united nations granting " supervised independence " to the ethnic albanian majority province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief un war crimes tribunal prosecutor carla del ponte serbia deeply opposes losing kosovo and its ally russia has threatened to use its un security council veto to stop that happening , but belgrade wants to reap the benefits of joining europe 's rich club .
merkel confirmed that deep divisions remained between the serbian government and the eu about the future status of kosovo .
" there are still clear divisions about kosovo , " she said .
serbian president boris tadic said belgrade insisted that granting independence to kosovo was " completely unacceptable . "
he added , however , that " there is still a lot of room to maneuver in negotiations in the hope of finding a compromise .

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .
in remarks to the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , the us president rejected speculation that disagreement between officials working on a climate change text for approval at the g8 meeting had soured us-german relations .
the full text of the interview was to be published saturday .

" it is clear that we need a more ambitious position from the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso did n't mince words barroso 's strong criticism follows merkel 's cautious welcome to the bush initiative .
speaking thursday , merkel said bush 's speech represented " movement " on the previous uncompromising us position on setting greenhouse gas emission targets and an " important step on the road to heiligendamm . "
barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .
" but market mechanisms only work when one has binding targets . "
he expressed the hope the us would see the need to bring the united nations into the process , adding that the g8 summit should provide a launching pad for the un climate protection meeting in bali in december .
beyond bush barroso said bush 's initiative was being superceded by events within the us , where " public opinion on the issue is developing at breathtaking pace . "

the top german official preparing the ground for heiligendamm acknowledged that there was no common line on the issue .
bernd pfaffenbach said " exaggerated expectations " had been generated in the run-up to heiligendamm and did not rule out failure to reach accord on climate protection .
pfaffenbach said bush 's idea of drawing in the large industrialized countries and developing giants like india and china could " certainly make sense , " but he stressed that the german approach was to work through the un .

overestimating her influence ?
under merkel 's leadership , the eu has set ambitious targets for cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
a similar goal has been set for increasing the use of renewable energy resources .
in its leading article , the ftd said the german chancellor had overestimated her powers on the world stage following her success on the issue at an eu summit in brussels in march .

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .
in remarks to the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , the us president rejected speculation that disagreement between officials working on a climate change text for approval at the g8 meeting had soured us-german relations .

speaking thursday , merkel said bush 's speech represented " movement " on the previous uncompromising us position on setting greenhouse gas emission targets and an " important step on the road to heiligendamm . "
barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .
" but market mechanisms only work when one has binding targets . "
he expressed the hope the us would see the need to bring the united nations into the process , adding that the g8 summit should provide a launching pad for the un climate protection meeting in bali in december .

dw-world.de makes a first excursion through the region from celle to luneburg to hanover and wolfsbuettel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half-timbered house in celle around 500 half-timbered houses from the 16th-18th centuries set the tone in celle 's historic city center , half an hour north of hanover by car .
surrounded by extensive moors , the region around celle is a nice spot for walks or bike rides , leading through the lowlands and wide fields to luneburg .
impressive house gables characterize the 1,000 year old hanseatic town of lüneburg , telling the stories of the former wealth of the citizens .
today , the salt factory , once luneburg 's most important source of revenue , has been transformed into the german salt museum .
the area surrounding both luneburg and celle is well-known for its lush heath that is covered in purple flowers during the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celle palace duke otto ii of brunswik-luneburg founded celle , now home to 73,000 people , in 1292 , the year his palace was built upon which the town was oriented .
as celle was not a target for extensive destruction during the world wars , many historical buildings have been preserved .
biblical inscriptions people carved into the balconies of their houses remain from the time of the reformation , which had already reached the city in 1527 .
baroque glory visitors can climb the 234 steps into the tower of the town church to get a view of the tranquil town from above .
inside the church , the sumptuous stucco works with figures and motives of plants stand-out as an unusual amount of decoration for a protestant church .
the last duke , george william , was a great fan of the baroque and commissioned an italian artist to decorate the church accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal gardens of herrenhausen in hanover but the nobility did n't always have the funds available for such impressive decoration .
instead they hired craftsmen to make fakes : wolfenbuettel palace , a half-timbered house , looks like a stone building ; the alleged marble columns in university of goettingen 's festival room are made of wood and the sculptures in the herrenhausen gardens in hanover were formed from sandstone instead of marble .
nevertheless , the gardens , one of a few remained baroque annexes in germany , are well worth an excursion .
heinrich the lion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunschweig city center thanks to its central location , heinrich the lion settled in braunschweig , around 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- east of hanover .
a bronze lion at burgplatz recalls his reign , as does dankwarderode , the romanesque palace he had built 1173 , one of the few old town buildings to survive world war ii bombing .
legend has it that the scratch marks on the door to braunschweig cathedral , adjacent to dankwarderode palace , were made by a lion that heinrich had saved during a pilgrimage and brought home .
in reality , heinrich took back to braunschweig strong impressions from his journeys which , among others things , inspired him to have the cathedral 's interior decked out with paintings from byzantium .
a copy of heinrich the lion 's illustrated bible is on view in the church - heinrich did n't know how to read .
the herzog august library in neighboring wolfenbuettel has the original as part of its collection of handwritten books , the largest in northern germany , where visitors can marvel at 500,000 books from before 1850 alone . dw staff -lrb- nak -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trier : romans , princes and tourists " roma secunda " , the second rome : that 's what trier was called during the second and third centuries .

german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .
germans in favor , but not donating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the form is n't hard to fill out , few germans have signed up to donate their organs organ donation in germany is voluntary and requires potential donors to carry a donor id .
an independent authority then applies a set of medical criteria to decide who receives a donor 's organs , which harvesting and transplantation strictly separated from each other .
some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "
automatic acceptance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .
" when a 3-year-old boy who received a liver transplant and nine months ago could n't walk wins an egg race after a long hospital stay , that 's something that moves you , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial dutch organ donor reality tv show to go ahead the dutch channel behind a reality tv show in which an organ donor must choose one of three candidates to receive her kidney has promised to broadcast it friday despite the ruckus it has caused .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 01.06.2007 opinion : a new spin on an old strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just before the g8 summit , the us presented a strategy to fight climate change .
president bush said the greatest producers of harmful emissions would agree on common goals by late 2008 .
dw 's rolf wenkel was unimpressed . to put it bluntly : the washed-up inhabitant of the white house has n't learned a thing .
this time , too , his ideas are far behind those of the german g8 presidency - and of the international community to set a decisive course against the threatening climate catastrophe .
in heiligendamm , german chancellor angela merkel wants to move the eight leading industrial countries toward binding maximum limits for greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- at most .
to reach that goal , worldwide carbon dioxide emissions would have to fall by 50 percent by 2050 compared to the level in 1990 .
however , the biggest co2 emitter on earth continues to avoid responsibility : thus bush proposes that the united states should only start to draft long-term aims to reduce co2 emissions in the autumn .
each government would then decide for itself how to achieve these aims .
allegedly , china and india , which are merely onlookers at the g8 summit , have already signaled their agreement .
that may be the case .
still , bush , who has been a failure on every level of policy , is offering nothing more than a new spin on an old strategy .
he staves off the international community until fall , with a single press conference debases all the resolutions on the issue prepared for heiligendamm , and , as he has for years , trusts us industry , with its technological edge , to set things straight - the main thing being that economic growth is healthy .
bush appears to be blind .
he 's blind to the 13 us states that combined their efforts in a climate protection initiative .
he 's blind to the innumerable us cities that have long been ignoring the brakesman in the white house .
he 's blind to companies like general electric or general motors that want to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent .
who still takes this man seriously ?
in an initial appraisal , merkel described the president 's initiative as an " important statement " ahead of the meeting in heiligendamm .
what else could she do ?
the rug is being pulled out from under her feet , 12 months of hard bilateral and multilateral negotiations on climate protection may have been wasted , but still , merkel has to remain diplomatic .
she faces a pile of broken glass .
but she did n't cause the damage .
rather , it was a provincial politician from texas , who has long imagined he knows something about world politics .

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .
in remarks to the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , the us president rejected speculation that disagreement between officials working on a climate change text for approval at the g8 meeting had soured us-german relations .
the full text of the interview was to be published saturday .
special responsibility in his remarks to the ftd , barroso said the us had " special responsibility as a large emitter of pollutants . "
" it is clear that we need a more ambitious position from the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso did n't mince words barroso 's strong criticism follows merkel 's cautious welcome to the bush initiative .
speaking thursday , merkel said bush 's speech represented " movement " on the previous uncompromising us position on setting greenhouse gas emission targets and an " important step on the road to heiligendamm . "
barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .
" but market mechanisms only work when one has binding targets . "
he expressed the hope the us would see the need to bring the united nations into the process , adding that the g8 summit should provide a launching pad for the un climate protection meeting in bali in december .
beyond bush barroso said bush 's initiative was being superceded by events within the us , where " public opinion on the issue is developing at breathtaking pace . "
noting that bush leaves office in january 2009 , the eu head expressed the hope for a " real breakthrough to the post-kyoto era in 2009 . "
the top german official preparing the ground for heiligendamm acknowledged that there was no common line on the issue .
bernd pfaffenbach said " exaggerated expectations " had been generated in the run-up to heiligendamm and did not rule out failure to reach accord on climate protection .
pfaffenbach said bush 's idea of drawing in the large industrialized countries and developing giants like india and china could " certainly make sense , " but he stressed that the german approach was to work through the un .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also waking up to a looming climate catastrophe the 1997 kyoto protocol , which calls for limited reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the industrialized world , runs out in 2012 .

overestimating her influence ?
under merkel 's leadership , the eu has set ambitious targets for cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
a similar goal has been set for increasing the use of renewable energy resources .
in its leading article , the ftd said the german chancellor had overestimated her powers on the world stage following her success on the issue at an eu summit in brussels in march .

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .

barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .

last year , the registered number of new infections rose by four percent . according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , germany 's premier scientific research and public health agency , there were 2,611 new hiv infections registered in 2006 .
that is a four-percent rise over the previous year , and the highest increase since new infections specifically began being logged in 1993 .
in its " epidemiological bulletin , " rki reported that the number of registered , newly diagnosed hiv infections had thereby risen 81 percent since 2001 .
however , the institute noted that one reason for that major increase is better methods of detecting and documenting infections .
with that adjustment , the rki estimated that the number of actual new infections between 2001 and 2006 rose by around 40 percent .

german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .
germans in favor , but not donating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the form is n't hard to fill out , few germans have signed up to donate their organs organ donation in germany is voluntary and requires potential donors to carry a donor id .
an independent authority then applies a set of medical criteria to decide who receives a donor 's organs , which harvesting and transplantation strictly separated from each other .
some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "
automatic acceptance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .
" when a 3-year-old boy who received a liver transplant and nine months ago could n't walk wins an egg race after a long hospital stay , that 's something that moves you , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial dutch organ donor reality tv show to go ahead the dutch channel behind a reality tv show in which an organ donor must choose one of three candidates to receive her kidney has promised to broadcast it friday despite the ruckus it has caused .

last year , the registered number of new infections rose by four percent . according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , germany 's premier scientific research and public health agency , there were 2,611 new hiv infections registered in 2006 .
that is a four-percent rise over the previous year , and the highest increase since new infections specifically began being logged in 1993 .
in its " epidemiological bulletin , " rki reported that the number of registered , newly diagnosed hiv infections had thereby risen 81 percent since 2001 .
however , the institute noted that one reason for that major increase is better methods of detecting and documenting infections .
with that adjustment , the rki estimated that the number of actual new infections between 2001 and 2006 rose by around 40 percent .
while big cities still show a high number of registered new infections , the greatest number was seen in smaller towns of 100,000 people or less .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection and documentation have improved that increase was found among homosexual and heterosexual people alike .
also , northern and southern german states were affected most , while the number of registered new infections stagnated or dropped in central and eastern states .
initial diagnoses highest among the middle-aged also the greatest number of initial diagnoses was found among 40- to 60-year-olds .
the group with the greatest number of reported new infections remains homosexual men - at 52 percent ; heterosexuals compose 14.6 percent of the people who registered infections for the first time in 2006 .
women made up 19 percent .
the institute reported that 11 children were born with hiv last year in germany ; in seven of the cases , the mothers had not been tested for the virus .
proper medical , pre-natal care can often prevent a mother-to-child transmission of hiv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children with hiv are abandoned among the 2,611 people reported with new infections last year , 14.8 were uncertain how they were infected with the virus .
education still - or again - a problem according to the thursday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- paper , germany 's federal center for health education said that many europeans believe that aids now primarily affects only developing countries .
younger generations have missed out on the awareness programs of the 1990s , the paper wrote .
the center said that less than 40 percent of the german population considers aids a dangerous disease .
" we may end up gambling away what we what we achieved in education during the ' 90s , " elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , told the faz .
after a long lull , more money is now being invested in preventions campaigns , she said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the battle between patents and patients to ease aids suffering pharmaceuticals have an imperative beyond the profit motive , since they are in the business of saving lives .

last year , the registered number of new infections rose by four percent . according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , germany 's premier scientific research and public health agency , there were 2,611 new hiv infections registered in 2006 .
that is a four-percent rise over the previous year , and the highest increase since new infections specifically began being logged in 1993 .
in its " epidemiological bulletin , " rki reported that the number of registered , newly diagnosed hiv infections had thereby risen 81 percent since 2001 .
however , the institute noted that one reason for that major increase is better methods of detecting and documenting infections .
with that adjustment , the rki estimated that the number of actual new infections between 2001 and 2006 rose by around 40 percent .
while big cities still show a high number of registered new infections , the greatest number was seen in smaller towns of 100,000 people or less .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection and documentation have improved that increase was found among homosexual and heterosexual people alike .
also , northern and southern german states were affected most , while the number of registered new infections stagnated or dropped in central and eastern states .
initial diagnoses highest among the middle-aged also the greatest number of initial diagnoses was found among 40- to 60-year-olds .
the group with the greatest number of reported new infections remains homosexual men - at 52 percent ; heterosexuals compose 14.6 percent of the people who registered infections for the first time in 2006 .
women made up 19 percent .
the institute reported that 11 children were born with hiv last year in germany ; in seven of the cases , the mothers had not been tested for the virus .
proper medical , pre-natal care can often prevent a mother-to-child transmission of hiv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children with hiv are abandoned among the 2,611 people reported with new infections last year , 14.8 were uncertain how they were infected with the virus .
education still - or again - a problem according to the thursday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- paper , germany 's federal center for health education said that many europeans believe that aids now primarily affects only developing countries .
younger generations have missed out on the awareness programs of the 1990s , the paper wrote .
the center said that less than 40 percent of the german population considers aids a dangerous disease .
" we may end up gambling away what we what we achieved in education during the ' 90s , " elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , told the faz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.06.2007 controversial dutch tv organ transplant show a hoax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ethics council said donation should be assumed if a patient does not state otherwise a dutch tv show in which patients in need of an organ transplant were to compete for a woman 's kidneys turned out to be a hoax .
german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .
germans in favor , but not donating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the form is n't hard to fill out , few germans have signed up to donate their organs organ donation in germany is voluntary and requires potential donors to carry a donor id .
an independent authority then applies a set of medical criteria to decide who receives a donor 's organs , which harvesting and transplantation strictly separated from each other .
some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "
automatic acceptance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .
" when a 3-year-old boy who received a liver transplant and nine months ago could n't walk wins an egg race after a long hospital stay , that 's something that moves you , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial dutch organ donor reality tv show to go ahead the dutch channel behind a reality tv show in which an organ donor must choose one of three candidates to receive her kidney has promised to broadcast it friday despite the ruckus it has caused .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "
the comments come after a bosnian serb general accused of genocide during the bosnia war from 1992-95 bosnia was delivered to the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
arrest at the border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdravko tolimir in 1996 zdravko tolimir was arrested on the border between serbia and bosnia 's serb republic in a joint operation by nato and the eu peacekeeping force eufor on thursday .
on friday , he was flown to the netherlands from the bosnian capital sarajevo .
rehn said partnerships talks were likely this month , with an exact date for talks to be set after carla del ponte , chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , returns from belgrade , where she is scheduled to travel on monday .
del ponte 's spokeswoman said the prosecutor would meet the serbian president and the prime minister and would provide the eu and the un security council with a full report on her trip .
war criminal-tracking a condition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mourning loss at a memorial center near srebrenica the eu froze the so-called " stabilization and association agreement " negotiations with serbia on joining the bloc because the balkan state was not fully cooperating with the war crimes tribunal .
this was mainly due to belgrade 's failure to hand over suspects like former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , whom experts say is still hiding in serbia .
during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .
radovan karadzic , the bosnian serb wartime political leader , and three other suspects charged with war crimes by the un tribunal also remain at large .
political motivation the eu 's decision to resume talks is seen as a political sweetener to help belgrade swallow the bitter pill of the united nations granting " supervised independence " to the ethnic albanian majority province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief un war crimes tribunal prosecutor carla del ponte serbia deeply opposes losing kosovo and its ally russia has threatened to use its un security council veto to stop that happening , but belgrade wants to reap the benefits of joining europe 's rich club .
merkel confirmed that deep divisions remained between the serbian government and the eu about the future status of kosovo .
" there are still clear divisions about kosovo , " she said .
serbian president boris tadic said belgrade insisted that granting independence to kosovo was " completely unacceptable . "
he added , however , that " there is still a lot of room to maneuver in negotiations in the hope of finding a compromise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.06.2007 controversial dutch tv organ transplant show a hoax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ethics council said donation should be assumed if a patient does not state otherwise a dutch tv show in which patients in need of an organ transplant were to compete for a woman 's kidneys turned out to be a hoax .
german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .
germans in favor , but not donating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the form is n't hard to fill out , few germans have signed up to donate their organs organ donation in germany is voluntary and requires potential donors to carry a donor id .
an independent authority then applies a set of medical criteria to decide who receives a donor 's organs , which harvesting and transplantation strictly separated from each other .
some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "
automatic acceptance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .
" when a 3-year-old boy who received a liver transplant and nine months ago could n't walk wins an egg race after a long hospital stay , that 's something that moves you , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial dutch organ donor reality tv show to go ahead the dutch channel behind a reality tv show in which an organ donor must choose one of three candidates to receive her kidney has promised to broadcast it friday despite the ruckus it has caused .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "

this was mainly due to belgrade 's failure to hand over suspects like former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , whom experts say is still hiding in serbia .
during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .

president bush said the greatest producers of harmful emissions would agree on common goals by late 2008 .
dw 's rolf wenkel was unimpressed . to put it bluntly : the washed-up inhabitant of the white house has n't learned a thing .
this time , too , his ideas are far behind those of the german g8 presidency - and of the international community to set a decisive course against the threatening climate catastrophe .
in heiligendamm , german chancellor angela merkel wants to move the eight leading industrial countries toward binding maximum limits for greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- at most .
to reach that goal , worldwide carbon dioxide emissions would have to fall by 50 percent by 2050 compared to the level in 1990 .
however , the biggest co2 emitter on earth continues to avoid responsibility : thus bush proposes that the united states should only start to draft long-term aims to reduce co2 emissions in the autumn .
each government would then decide for itself how to achieve these aims .
allegedly , china and india , which are merely onlookers at the g8 summit , have already signaled their agreement .
that may be the case .
still , bush , who has been a failure on every level of policy , is offering nothing more than a new spin on an old strategy .
he staves off the international community until fall , with a single press conference debases all the resolutions on the issue prepared for heiligendamm , and , as he has for years , trusts us industry , with its technological edge , to set things straight - the main thing being that economic growth is healthy .
bush appears to be blind .
he 's blind to the 13 us states that combined their efforts in a climate protection initiative .
he 's blind to the innumerable us cities that have long been ignoring the brakesman in the white house .
he 's blind to companies like general electric or general motors that want to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent .

in an initial appraisal , merkel described the president 's initiative as an " important statement " ahead of the meeting in heiligendamm .

" german aid spending will rise by about 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in 2008 , " merkel told the friday edition of german mass-circulation bild tabloid .
the increase would be about 14 per cent compared to this year .
government officials who asked not to be quoted by name told dpa news service the disclosure was meant to influence the summit , though the boost mainly fulfils commitments already given to increase aid .
merkel said the rise was the biggest of any department in the federal budget .
germany 's 2007 aid budget was about 4.5 billion euros .
" money is n't everything " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel expects recipients to use the money wisely but merkel added that increasing development aid was n't the only thing that had to happen .
" money is n't everything , " merkel said .
" you could pump a vast amount of money into africa and do the completely wrong things with it .
" we have to be partners who are equal in standing , with rights , but also with duties , " she said .
" the money has to get through to the people and really improve things .
that does not always happen . "

" it is meant as a signal to the other g8 countries , " she said .
" everyone has to realize that africa 's problems will spread here if we do n't help fix them at source . "
at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , the industrialized nations agreed to gradually boost foreign aid spending to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2015 .
they must reach 0.51 per cent by 2010 .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "
the comments come after a bosnian serb general accused of genocide during the bosnia war from 1992-95 bosnia was delivered to the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
arrest at the border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdravko tolimir in 1996 zdravko tolimir was arrested on the border between serbia and bosnia 's serb republic in a joint operation by nato and the eu peacekeeping force eufor on thursday .
on friday , he was flown to the netherlands from the bosnian capital sarajevo .
rehn said partnerships talks were likely this month , with an exact date for talks to be set after carla del ponte , chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , returns from belgrade , where she is scheduled to travel on monday .
del ponte 's spokeswoman said the prosecutor would meet the serbian president and the prime minister and would provide the eu and the un security council with a full report on her trip .
war criminal-tracking a condition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mourning loss at a memorial center near srebrenica the eu froze the so-called " stabilization and association agreement " negotiations with serbia on joining the bloc because the balkan state was not fully cooperating with the war crimes tribunal .
this was mainly due to belgrade 's failure to hand over suspects like former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , whom experts say is still hiding in serbia .
during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .
radovan karadzic , the bosnian serb wartime political leader , and three other suspects charged with war crimes by the un tribunal also remain at large .
political motivation the eu 's decision to resume talks is seen as a political sweetener to help belgrade swallow the bitter pill of the united nations granting " supervised independence " to the ethnic albanian majority province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief un war crimes tribunal prosecutor carla del ponte serbia deeply opposes losing kosovo and its ally russia has threatened to use its un security council veto to stop that happening , but belgrade wants to reap the benefits of joining europe 's rich club .
merkel confirmed that deep divisions remained between the serbian government and the eu about the future status of kosovo .
" there are still clear divisions about kosovo , " she said .
serbian president boris tadic said belgrade insisted that granting independence to kosovo was " completely unacceptable . "
he added , however , that " there is still a lot of room to maneuver in negotiations in the hope of finding a compromise .

germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .

pick from topics like industrial heritage along the river lippe , or the westphalian coal mining trail .
in the mood for food ?
do n't miss the bread , corn and beer tour .
those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .
today the same tower , built in 1892 by august thyssen , is home to a multimedia water theme museum .
in bottrop , just northeast of oberhausen , the tetrahedron - a 50-meter filigree steel construction - rises up over a former gigantic slag heap .

and it is one of germany ’ s most tradition-steeped regions . when the alps were still considered inhospitable and the black forest was waiting to be discovered by the english and the french , the harz mountains exuded an attraction for artists , students – and not least , poets . the harz mountains , 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- long , 30 kilometers wide , and some 400 million years old , straddle the border between what was once east and west germany , in the central part of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brocken at 1,142 meters the 1,142 meter -lrb- 3,747 feet -rrb- peak called the brockenberg , or brocken mountain , has an ancient reputation of being a haunting ground for witches , goblins and other creatures in the pagan pantheon .
the well-traveled goethe called the brockenberg his favorite mountain , and gave it a place in literary history by using it as the setting for the witches ’ orgiastic sabbath scene in faust . road for romantics ascending the 12-kilometer trail up the brocken from the town of ilsenburg was something of a rite of passage for german romantics .
today the route , which the poet heinrich heine made famous in his verses , is marked by signs showing green rectangles .
not far from the steeply descending ilsefälle valley – there where the stream tumbles over the granite stones – is a monument to heine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasse in goslar the harz range got their name from the forest .
in middle-high german , “ hart ” meant " wooded area . "
back then , though , the forests were beech trees , not the spruce that is currently found .
the beech trees were eventually all cut down for building houses , supporting tunnels and smelting the ore that had been mined from the mountains for 1,000 years .
fast-growing spruce were planted in their place . mass tourism to the harz region developed in the second half of the 19th century , with the advent of the railway system .
since 1992 , the train running from wernigerode to nordhausen also covers the stretch , which was closed in the post-war era , from drei annen hohne to the top of the brockenberg .
at 60.5 kilometers , it ’ s the the longest narrow-gauge steam locomotive route in germany . national park today the area around the brockenberg – or blocksberg , as it is often called in local slang -lrb- " brocken " means " lump " or " block " -rrb- – is a national park .
always a popular destination , some 100,000 people climbed to the brocken plateau in 1900 .
today , though , the numbers lie at over 2 million visitors a year .
in the brocken house , visitors center , the national park offers information on the 1,500 types of plants that live in the high , often wet mountain climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castle in the harz in the eastern part of the harz mountains , the town of schierke was a popular ski resort from the 1920s to the 1940s .
the small , cozy mountain town is not far from the towns of braunlage and wernigerode , directly at the foot of the brocken .
visitors can climb the brockenberg from there on foot - but also on skis , in a horse drawn carriage , or with the brocken train . the birthplace of skiing in harz mountains is in neighboring braunlage .
in 1890 , germany ’ s first ski classes were taught here , and in 1892 , the first winter-sports club was founded .
braunlage has a ski area , an illuminated ski run , an ice rink , cross country trails , and a ski school .
there are some 7,500 beds for tourists in the 5,000 person town . other towns to visit in the region are wernigerode , with its many half-timbered houses , bad lauterberg , which has the leading health spa in northern germany based on the unusual " kneipp " method , and goslar , whose medieval old town is so well preserved that it was named a unesco world heritage site . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de watch out for the bike paths in germany , warns a traveller our readers enjoyed the beer and dirndls , the coffee and the cake while visiting germany and recommend going to heidelberg , the harz region and necker valley .

explore cologne and beyond düsseldorf : stop , shop and stroll essen : a changing industrial landscape a picturesque pedal down the rhine koblenz : good for getting over jet lag regions -pipe- 01.06.2007 the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zollverein mine shaft is said to be one the world 's most beautiful call it the unromantic road .
germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .
tycoons , workers and orange bicycles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water museum each trail highlights a specific theme .
interested in social history ?
take your pick of the workers settlements route or the tycoons ' villas route .
hard-core industry more your thing ?
pick from topics like industrial heritage along the river lippe , or the westphalian coal mining trail .
in the mood for food ?
do n't miss the bread , corn and beer tour .
those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .
today the same tower , built in 1892 by august thyssen , is home to a multimedia water theme museum .
in bottrop , just northeast of oberhausen , the tetrahedron - a 50-meter filigree steel construction - rises up over a former gigantic slag heap .
the ruhr valley has something for everyone - cyclists , hikers and water sports fans will find themselves well catered for here .
set this against the monumental background of the region 's industrial history , and you have all the ingredients for an unusual and informative trip . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany home to some of europe 's dirtiest power stations germany contributed heavily to the world wildlife fund 's " dirty thirty " list of most-polluting power stations in the european union , landing six of its coal-fired plants in the top ten .

explore cologne and beyond düsseldorf : stop , shop and stroll essen : a changing industrial landscape a picturesque pedal down the rhine koblenz : good for getting over jet lag regions -pipe- 01.06.2007 the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zollverein mine shaft is said to be one the world 's most beautiful call it the unromantic road .
germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .
tycoons , workers and orange bicycles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water museum each trail highlights a specific theme .
interested in social history ?
take your pick of the workers settlements route or the tycoons ' villas route .
hard-core industry more your thing ?
pick from topics like industrial heritage along the river lippe , or the westphalian coal mining trail .
in the mood for food ?
do n't miss the bread , corn and beer tour .
those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .
today the same tower , built in 1892 by august thyssen , is home to a multimedia water theme museum .
in bottrop , just northeast of oberhausen , the tetrahedron - a 50-meter filigree steel construction - rises up over a former gigantic slag heap .
the ruhr valley has something for everyone - cyclists , hikers and water sports fans will find themselves well catered for here .

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .
in remarks to the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , the us president rejected speculation that disagreement between officials working on a climate change text for approval at the g8 meeting had soured us-german relations .
the full text of the interview was to be published saturday .

speaking thursday , merkel said bush 's speech represented " movement " on the previous uncompromising us position on setting greenhouse gas emission targets and an " important step on the road to heiligendamm . "
barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .
" but market mechanisms only work when one has binding targets . "
he expressed the hope the us would see the need to bring the united nations into the process , adding that the g8 summit should provide a launching pad for the un climate protection meeting in bali in december .

the top german official preparing the ground for heiligendamm acknowledged that there was no common line on the issue .
bernd pfaffenbach said " exaggerated expectations " had been generated in the run-up to heiligendamm and did not rule out failure to reach accord on climate protection .

under merkel 's leadership , the eu has set ambitious targets for cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .

last year , the registered number of new infections rose by four percent . according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , germany 's premier scientific research and public health agency , there were 2,611 new hiv infections registered in 2006 .
that is a four-percent rise over the previous year , and the highest increase since new infections specifically began being logged in 1993 .
in its " epidemiological bulletin , " rki reported that the number of registered , newly diagnosed hiv infections had thereby risen 81 percent since 2001 .
however , the institute noted that one reason for that major increase is better methods of detecting and documenting infections .
with that adjustment , the rki estimated that the number of actual new infections between 2001 and 2006 rose by around 40 percent .

" german aid spending will rise by about 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in 2008 , " merkel told the friday edition of german mass-circulation bild tabloid .
the increase would be about 14 per cent compared to this year .
government officials who asked not to be quoted by name told dpa news service the disclosure was meant to influence the summit , though the boost mainly fulfils commitments already given to increase aid .
merkel said the rise was the biggest of any department in the federal budget .
germany 's 2007 aid budget was about 4.5 billion euros .
" money is n't everything " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel expects recipients to use the money wisely but merkel added that increasing development aid was n't the only thing that had to happen .
" money is n't everything , " merkel said .
" you could pump a vast amount of money into africa and do the completely wrong things with it .
" we have to be partners who are equal in standing , with rights , but also with duties , " she said .
" the money has to get through to the people and really improve things .
that does not always happen . "

" it is meant as a signal to the other g8 countries , " she said .
" everyone has to realize that africa 's problems will spread here if we do n't help fix them at source . "
at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , the industrialized nations agreed to gradually boost foreign aid spending to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2015 .
they must reach 0.51 per cent by 2010 .

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "
the comments come after a bosnian serb general accused of genocide during the bosnia war from 1992-95 bosnia was delivered to the war crimes tribunal in the hague .

on friday , he was flown to the netherlands from the bosnian capital sarajevo .
rehn said partnerships talks were likely this month , with an exact date for talks to be set after carla del ponte , chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , returns from belgrade , where she is scheduled to travel on monday .

this was mainly due to belgrade 's failure to hand over suspects like former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , whom experts say is still hiding in serbia .
during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .

german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .

some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "
automatic acceptance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .
" it 's along the lines of ' saying nothing means agreement , " ' hüppe said .
" but to me it seems to be the case that there are other reasons , organizational or even financial , in the process that have more of an effect on harvesting organs than patients ' objection . "
raising awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened awareness among doctors could lead to more organ transplants some doctors have also pointed out that a raised consciousness of organ donation among medical professionals and hospitals is required in germany .
" organ donation is a very difficult subject for hospitals , " said hans lilie , head of the federal doctors ' board 's permanent committee for organ transplantation .
" the individual hospital goes through a lot of work and does n't have anything to give its own patients .
i think we need more of a commitment from doctors to make an added effort for patients on waiting lists . "
nagel , who is taking part in negotiations at the world health organization and united nations to push for common organ donation policies , said the emotional results transplants can have need to be made clear to doctors and potential donors .
" when a 3-year-old boy who received a liver transplant and nine months ago could n't walk wins an egg race after a long hospital stay , that 's something that moves you , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial dutch organ donor reality tv show to go ahead the dutch channel behind a reality tv show in which an organ donor must choose one of three candidates to receive her kidney has promised to broadcast it friday despite the ruckus it has caused .

german doctors and politicians had criticized the program as unethical . a dutch television show purporting to feature a dying woman deciding who will receive one of her kidney is a hoax , presenters said friday .
the program , which drew criticism from across europe over the past view days .
" horribly macabre and to me humanly incomprehensible , " said hubert hüppe , the christian democratic union 's spokesperson for bioethics issues , of the show .
" thank god something like this is n't possible under german law . "
" when you see how a show practically lets you give the thumbs up or down on someone 's life via text message all it does is damage people 's trust in medicine , which can save lives , " he added .
germans in favor , but not donating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the form is n't hard to fill out , few germans have signed up to donate their organs organ donation in germany is voluntary and requires potential donors to carry a donor id .
an independent authority then applies a set of medical criteria to decide who receives a donor 's organs , which harvesting and transplantation strictly separated from each other .
some 80 percent of all germans say they are in favor of organ transplants , but only 15 people per one million germans actually donate their organs , according to the german organ transplant foundation -lrb- dso -rrb- .
" if a person dies of a stroke for example , the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreas can all be harvested , " said eckhard nagel , a member of germany 's ethics council , ahead of germany 's national organ donation day on june 2 .
" in such a case , organ donation could save six lives - or even seven if the liver can be shared . "
automatic acceptance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german laws keep patients and donors from knowing who receives transplant organs with approximately 12,000 people on transplant waiting lists in germany - and an average of three dying each day - dso officials hope increasing awareness among germans will lead to more people choosing to donate their organs .
" we believe it is actually an ethical duty for every citizen to consider and decide whether he or she would like to be an organ donor or not , " nagel said .
the ethics council , which advises chancellor angela merkel 's government in ethical questions , last month suggested organ donation become automatic unless the deceased or their relatives say otherwise .
even confronted with a lack of viable organs available for donation , that 's a step politicians said goes too far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 01.06.2007 opinion : a new spin on an old strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just before the g8 summit , the us presented a strategy to fight climate change .
president bush said the greatest producers of harmful emissions would agree on common goals by late 2008 .
dw 's rolf wenkel was unimpressed . to put it bluntly : the washed-up inhabitant of the white house has n't learned a thing .
this time , too , his ideas are far behind those of the german g8 presidency - and of the international community to set a decisive course against the threatening climate catastrophe .
in heiligendamm , german chancellor angela merkel wants to move the eight leading industrial countries toward binding maximum limits for greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- at most .
to reach that goal , worldwide carbon dioxide emissions would have to fall by 50 percent by 2050 compared to the level in 1990 .
however , the biggest co2 emitter on earth continues to avoid responsibility : thus bush proposes that the united states should only start to draft long-term aims to reduce co2 emissions in the autumn .
each government would then decide for itself how to achieve these aims .
allegedly , china and india , which are merely onlookers at the g8 summit , have already signaled their agreement .
that may be the case .
still , bush , who has been a failure on every level of policy , is offering nothing more than a new spin on an old strategy .
he staves off the international community until fall , with a single press conference debases all the resolutions on the issue prepared for heiligendamm , and , as he has for years , trusts us industry , with its technological edge , to set things straight - the main thing being that economic growth is healthy .
bush appears to be blind .
he 's blind to the 13 us states that combined their efforts in a climate protection initiative .
he 's blind to the innumerable us cities that have long been ignoring the brakesman in the white house .
he 's blind to companies like general electric or general motors that want to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent .
who still takes this man seriously ?
in an initial appraisal , merkel described the president 's initiative as an " important statement " ahead of the meeting in heiligendamm .
what else could she do ?
the rug is being pulled out from under her feet , 12 months of hard bilateral and multilateral negotiations on climate protection may have been wasted , but still , merkel has to remain diplomatic .
she faces a pile of broken glass .
but she did n't cause the damage .
rather , it was a provincial politician from texas , who has long imagined he knows something about world politics .

" german aid spending will rise by about 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in 2008 , " merkel told the friday edition of german mass-circulation bild tabloid .
the increase would be about 14 per cent compared to this year .
government officials who asked not to be quoted by name told dpa news service the disclosure was meant to influence the summit , though the boost mainly fulfils commitments already given to increase aid .
merkel said the rise was the biggest of any department in the federal budget .

" it is meant as a signal to the other g8 countries , " she said .
" everyone has to realize that africa 's problems will spread here if we do n't help fix them at source . "
at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , the industrialized nations agreed to gradually boost foreign aid spending to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2015 .
they must reach 0.51 per cent by 2010 .

" german aid spending will rise by about 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in 2008 , " merkel told the friday edition of german mass-circulation bild tabloid .
the increase would be about 14 per cent compared to this year .
government officials who asked not to be quoted by name told dpa news service the disclosure was meant to influence the summit , though the boost mainly fulfils commitments already given to increase aid .
merkel said the rise was the biggest of any department in the federal budget .
germany 's 2007 aid budget was about 4.5 billion euros .
" money is n't everything " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel expects recipients to use the money wisely but merkel added that increasing development aid was n't the only thing that had to happen .
" money is n't everything , " merkel said .
" you could pump a vast amount of money into africa and do the completely wrong things with it .
" we have to be partners who are equal in standing , with rights , but also with duties , " she said .
" the money has to get through to the people and really improve things .
that does not always happen . "
more aid to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the aid will continue in coming years heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , germany 's minister for economic cooperation and development , told the friday edition of süddeutsche zeitung that similar top-ups of 750 million euros would follow in the years 2009 to 2011 for a total boost of 3 billion euros .
" it is meant as a signal to the other g8 countries , " she said .
" everyone has to realize that africa 's problems will spread here if we do n't help fix them at source . "
at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , the industrialized nations agreed to gradually boost foreign aid spending to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2015 .
they must reach 0.51 per cent by 2010 .

president bush said the greatest producers of harmful emissions would agree on common goals by late 2008 .
dw 's rolf wenkel was unimpressed . to put it bluntly : the washed-up inhabitant of the white house has n't learned a thing .
this time , too , his ideas are far behind those of the german g8 presidency - and of the international community to set a decisive course against the threatening climate catastrophe .
in heiligendamm , german chancellor angela merkel wants to move the eight leading industrial countries toward binding maximum limits for greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- at most .
to reach that goal , worldwide carbon dioxide emissions would have to fall by 50 percent by 2050 compared to the level in 1990 .
however , the biggest co2 emitter on earth continues to avoid responsibility : thus bush proposes that the united states should only start to draft long-term aims to reduce co2 emissions in the autumn .
each government would then decide for itself how to achieve these aims .
allegedly , china and india , which are merely onlookers at the g8 summit , have already signaled their agreement .
that may be the case .
still , bush , who has been a failure on every level of policy , is offering nothing more than a new spin on an old strategy .
he staves off the international community until fall , with a single press conference debases all the resolutions on the issue prepared for heiligendamm , and , as he has for years , trusts us industry , with its technological edge , to set things straight - the main thing being that economic growth is healthy .
bush appears to be blind .
he 's blind to the 13 us states that combined their efforts in a climate protection initiative .
he 's blind to the innumerable us cities that have long been ignoring the brakesman in the white house .
he 's blind to companies like general electric or general motors that want to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent .
who still takes this man seriously ?
in an initial appraisal , merkel described the president 's initiative as an " important statement " ahead of the meeting in heiligendamm .
what else could she do ?
the rug is being pulled out from under her feet , 12 months of hard bilateral and multilateral negotiations on climate protection may have been wasted , but still , merkel has to remain diplomatic .
she faces a pile of broken glass .
but she did n't cause the damage .
rather , it was a provincial politician from texas , who has long imagined he knows something about world politics .

last year , the registered number of new infections rose by four percent . according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , germany 's premier scientific research and public health agency , there were 2,611 new hiv infections registered in 2006 .
that is a four-percent rise over the previous year , and the highest increase since new infections specifically began being logged in 1993 .
in its " epidemiological bulletin , " rki reported that the number of registered , newly diagnosed hiv infections had thereby risen 81 percent since 2001 .
however , the institute noted that one reason for that major increase is better methods of detecting and documenting infections .
with that adjustment , the rki estimated that the number of actual new infections between 2001 and 2006 rose by around 40 percent .
while big cities still show a high number of registered new infections , the greatest number was seen in smaller towns of 100,000 people or less .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection and documentation have improved that increase was found among homosexual and heterosexual people alike .
also , northern and southern german states were affected most , while the number of registered new infections stagnated or dropped in central and eastern states .
initial diagnoses highest among the middle-aged also the greatest number of initial diagnoses was found among 40- to 60-year-olds .
the group with the greatest number of reported new infections remains homosexual men - at 52 percent ; heterosexuals compose 14.6 percent of the people who registered infections for the first time in 2006 .
women made up 19 percent .
the institute reported that 11 children were born with hiv last year in germany ; in seven of the cases , the mothers had not been tested for the virus .
proper medical , pre-natal care can often prevent a mother-to-child transmission of hiv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children with hiv are abandoned among the 2,611 people reported with new infections last year , 14.8 were uncertain how they were infected with the virus .
education still - or again - a problem according to the thursday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- paper , germany 's federal center for health education said that many europeans believe that aids now primarily affects only developing countries .
younger generations have missed out on the awareness programs of the 1990s , the paper wrote .
the center said that less than 40 percent of the german population considers aids a dangerous disease .
" we may end up gambling away what we what we achieved in education during the ' 90s , " elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , told the faz .

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .
in remarks to the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , the us president rejected speculation that disagreement between officials working on a climate change text for approval at the g8 meeting had soured us-german relations .
the full text of the interview was to be published saturday .
special responsibility in his remarks to the ftd , barroso said the us had " special responsibility as a large emitter of pollutants . "
" it is clear that we need a more ambitious position from the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso did n't mince words barroso 's strong criticism follows merkel 's cautious welcome to the bush initiative .
speaking thursday , merkel said bush 's speech represented " movement " on the previous uncompromising us position on setting greenhouse gas emission targets and an " important step on the road to heiligendamm . "
barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .
" but market mechanisms only work when one has binding targets . "
he expressed the hope the us would see the need to bring the united nations into the process , adding that the g8 summit should provide a launching pad for the un climate protection meeting in bali in december .
beyond bush barroso said bush 's initiative was being superceded by events within the us , where " public opinion on the issue is developing at breathtaking pace . "
noting that bush leaves office in january 2009 , the eu head expressed the hope for a " real breakthrough to the post-kyoto era in 2009 . "
the top german official preparing the ground for heiligendamm acknowledged that there was no common line on the issue .
bernd pfaffenbach said " exaggerated expectations " had been generated in the run-up to heiligendamm and did not rule out failure to reach accord on climate protection .
pfaffenbach said bush 's idea of drawing in the large industrialized countries and developing giants like india and china could " certainly make sense , " but he stressed that the german approach was to work through the un .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also waking up to a looming climate catastrophe the 1997 kyoto protocol , which calls for limited reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the industrialized world , runs out in 2012 .
the us has not ratified the treaty and demands that rapidly developing countries like china and india be brought into the process .
overestimating her influence ?
under merkel 's leadership , the eu has set ambitious targets for cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
a similar goal has been set for increasing the use of renewable energy resources .
in its leading article , the ftd said the german chancellor had overestimated her powers on the world stage following her success on the issue at an eu summit in brussels in march .
the influential newspaper predicted the g8 summit , which takes place from wednesday to friday , would mark merkel 's " greatest foreign policy defeat " to date at the hands of bush . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a new spin on an old strategy just before the g8 summit , the us presented a strategy to fight climate change .

on the contrary , the altmühl valley is one of the most diverse regions in germany . the altmühl valley , which is germany 's largest natural park , was created in 1969 with the aim of protecting a rich landscape of natural delights and picturesque little towns such as the regional capital , eichstätt , dating back centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is dotted with old castles for nature-lovers , the best way to get around is by foot or bicycle , and with 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- of idyllic bike tracks meandering through the region , there are many routes to choose from . the typical altmühl landscape consists of lush forests and gently rolling hills , dotted with juniper bushes and clusters of rocks . one bike tour passes through picturesque little towns and villages , including essing which , set at the foot of high limestone cliffs , is one of the most popular images in the region .

on the contrary , the altmühl valley is one of the most diverse regions in germany . the altmühl valley , which is germany 's largest natural park , was created in 1969 with the aim of protecting a rich landscape of natural delights and picturesque little towns such as the regional capital , eichstätt , dating back centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is dotted with old castles for nature-lovers , the best way to get around is by foot or bicycle , and with 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- of idyllic bike tracks meandering through the region , there are many routes to choose from . the typical altmühl landscape consists of lush forests and gently rolling hills , dotted with juniper bushes and clusters of rocks . one bike tour passes through picturesque little towns and villages , including essing which , set at the foot of high limestone cliffs , is one of the most popular images in the region .
also well worth a visit are berching and greding , which still have the look of medieval towns , and beilngries , famous for its pitched roofs and baroque facades decorated with coats of arms . traces of times gone by perched high on the top of craggy rocks are formidable old castles which offer their visitors the chance to sample opulent banquets of ancient fare and try their hand at medieval games such as were once the pastime of knights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the limes , the ultimate northern border in the roman empire there are also signs of the celts and the romans .
in fact the roman limes borderline runs right through the park and " villa rustica " in möckenlohe gives an insight into country life during the roman era .
and for those who want even more from that chapter of history , the roman museum in weißenburg is full of treasures . the oldest monastic brewery in the world water enthusiasts can cycle all the way along the main-danube canal from kelheim in the south-east , to berching in the north .
the canal , which was completed in 1992 , is so much a part of the landscape that it 's hard to believe it 's not a natural waterway .

visits to germany 's more obscure destinations are rare by foreign tourists and even locals are often deterred .
in the country of autobahns , the latter might be partly to blame . most travelers to germany plan their itineraries around the highlights , but germans also tend not to take advantage of nearby natural and historical treasures .

visits to germany 's more obscure destinations are rare by foreign tourists and even locals are often deterred .
in the country of autobahns , the latter might be partly to blame . most travelers to germany plan their itineraries around the highlights , but germans also tend not to take advantage of nearby natural and historical treasures .
insufficient infrastructure and a lack of money to promote tourist offerings may be the main hindrances for both .
take germany 's harz mountains in central germany , for example .
it may take a little bit longer to reach the region that 's situated off the beaten track .
germany 's fast inter city express -lrb- ice -rrb- trains are prohibited in protected natural areas and four-lane roads are rare . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the st. stephanus cathedral , seen through the martini church while this does n't stop tourists , cheaper train prices might help to entice more visitors , said anke jessat , the owner of the abtshof hotel in halberstadt , known as the " gateway to the harz . " a small city in saxony-anhalt , it boasts a well preserved cathedral , historic city center and museums dedicated to its literary and cultural heritage .
halberstadt lies just a few miles away from great hiking , historic mountain towns , the unesco world heritage sites in quedlinberg and other sites along saxony-anhalt 's strasse der romantik , or romantic route .
limited customer service jessat said that significant progress has already been made to improve regional infrastructure , such as adding highways and regional train lines .
but funds are lacking to promote the region on a regular basis .
local offerings have limited opening hours , jessat added : often her guests want to visit the halberstadt cathedral or a museum the morning before they depart , but have to leave before the opening time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of goethe und schiller are just one of the many cultural offerings in weimar halberstadt conducted a major promotion campaign for the 1200th anniversary celebration in 2004 , including a john cage music project , but jessat said such efforts are only temporary and tourism promotion drops off afterwards .
ute huch , spokeswoman for halberstadt noted , however , that the activities surrounding the 2004 anniversary did more than just raise the number of overnight stays by 17 percent in the region during the same year .
" these events made us noticed , " she said .
" we are in a good position for tourism to grow . "
in fact , tourism has been growing for awhile - almost doubling in the past six to seven years , she said .
access is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eifel national park thuringia 's efforts to promote its cultural , historical and natural sites have also brought in a lot of foreign visitors .
thuringia enjoys a good deal of high speed train and interstate freeway infrastructure as well as a central location .
but it only has a small airport in erfurt and is somewhat remote for tourists , who come to germany for a short time and just see the highlights .
while promotion is a factor , good roads and train routes are also key . the array of lakes and forests and sorbish -lrb- a slavic minority -rrb- cultural touch of the spreewald between dresden and berlin draws a lot of tourists for day trips - since it 's easily reached by train or car in about an hour .
marianne kilka , marketing director for the spreewald tourism association said poor highway connections have been a problem in the area in the last 15 years , but have recently improved . not just an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle is a must-see for tourists although the eastern german states have significantly less tourism than in the west , some western states are not far ahead of the lowest rankers , such as saxony-anhalt and thuringia , with respective averages of 5.7 and 8.6 million overnight stays per year , according to the german statistics office . these states ' share of tourists is quite small compared with bavaria at about 74 million annual overnight stays . and except for a few iconoclastic tourist attractions such as neuschwanstein castle , germans make up the bulk of the tourism - about 82 percent . the eifel national park , an area rich in mountain hiking trails and volcanic lakes , lies in two states that have fewer tourists than most states in western germany . rhineland-palatinate has just under 20 million overnight stays per year and north rhine-westphalia has about 37 million .
the area has a lot to offer , but highways in the area do n't exactly roll out the welcome signs .
that 's why tourists might have to plan some extra time to check out those equally deserving , but less accessible sites .
or , they should just plan to skip neuschwanstein and the crowds . megan harris send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rescued storybook village the eastern german town of quedlinburg has been a unesco world heritage site since for the past 10 years .
the town was lucky : for a time , many of its unique monuments were in danger of being torn down .

the wild untamed nature of the eifel remains in the form of an accessible but thrilling modern wilderness .

but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .

on the contrary , the altmühl valley is one of the most diverse regions in germany . the altmühl valley , which is germany 's largest natural park , was created in 1969 with the aim of protecting a rich landscape of natural delights and picturesque little towns such as the regional capital , eichstätt , dating back centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is dotted with old castles for nature-lovers , the best way to get around is by foot or bicycle , and with 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- of idyllic bike tracks meandering through the region , there are many routes to choose from . the typical altmühl landscape consists of lush forests and gently rolling hills , dotted with juniper bushes and clusters of rocks . one bike tour passes through picturesque little towns and villages , including essing which , set at the foot of high limestone cliffs , is one of the most popular images in the region .
also well worth a visit are berching and greding , which still have the look of medieval towns , and beilngries , famous for its pitched roofs and baroque facades decorated with coats of arms . traces of times gone by perched high on the top of craggy rocks are formidable old castles which offer their visitors the chance to sample opulent banquets of ancient fare and try their hand at medieval games such as were once the pastime of knights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the limes , the ultimate northern border in the roman empire there are also signs of the celts and the romans .

on the contrary , the altmühl valley is one of the most diverse regions in germany . the altmühl valley , which is germany 's largest natural park , was created in 1969 with the aim of protecting a rich landscape of natural delights and picturesque little towns such as the regional capital , eichstätt , dating back centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is dotted with old castles for nature-lovers , the best way to get around is by foot or bicycle , and with 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- of idyllic bike tracks meandering through the region , there are many routes to choose from . the typical altmühl landscape consists of lush forests and gently rolling hills , dotted with juniper bushes and clusters of rocks . one bike tour passes through picturesque little towns and villages , including essing which , set at the foot of high limestone cliffs , is one of the most popular images in the region .
also well worth a visit are berching and greding , which still have the look of medieval towns , and beilngries , famous for its pitched roofs and baroque facades decorated with coats of arms . traces of times gone by perched high on the top of craggy rocks are formidable old castles which offer their visitors the chance to sample opulent banquets of ancient fare and try their hand at medieval games such as were once the pastime of knights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the limes , the ultimate northern border in the roman empire there are also signs of the celts and the romans .

and for those who want even more from that chapter of history , the roman museum in weißenburg is full of treasures . the oldest monastic brewery in the world water enthusiasts can cycle all the way along the main-danube canal from kelheim in the south-east , to berching in the north .
the canal , which was completed in 1992 , is so much a part of the landscape that it 's hard to believe it 's not a natural waterway .
a boat trip down the canal passes the famous weltenburg monastery , the oldest monastic brewery in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhein-main-danube canal at the weekends , the thousands of tourists who make their way there not only have the chance to sample the eight beers brewed on the stunning baroque premises , but to take in the breath-taking view of the 35-meter -lrb- 115-foot -rrb- high white cliffs through which the danube river forced its way many millennia ago . the crowning glory of a journey through the altmühl valley is a visit eichstätt , home to residenz square , which one travel guide dubs the " most beautiful baroque place north of the alps . "
with its mirrored walls and fine molding depicting tales of greek mythology , the residenz palace itself is also worth a look .
so , too , is the cathedral , with its beguiling 500-year-old stained glass window in the west cloister . elke roessler -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rhine river transformed into nearly pristine water stream the rhine is the longest river within germany and is known for its beauty , with medieval castles and lovely wine villages along its banks .

visits to germany 's more obscure destinations are rare by foreign tourists and even locals are often deterred .

explore cologne and beyond düsseldorf : stop , shop and stroll essen : a changing industrial landscape a picturesque pedal down the rhine koblenz : good for getting over jet lag regions -pipe- 01.06.2007 the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zollverein mine shaft is said to be one the world 's most beautiful call it the unromantic road .
germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .
tycoons , workers and orange bicycles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water museum each trail highlights a specific theme .
interested in social history ?
take your pick of the workers settlements route or the tycoons ' villas route .
hard-core industry more your thing ?
pick from topics like industrial heritage along the river lippe , or the westphalian coal mining trail .
in the mood for food ?
do n't miss the bread , corn and beer tour .
those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .
today the same tower , built in 1892 by august thyssen , is home to a multimedia water theme museum .
in bottrop , just northeast of oberhausen , the tetrahedron - a 50-meter filigree steel construction - rises up over a former gigantic slag heap .
the ruhr valley has something for everyone - cyclists , hikers and water sports fans will find themselves well catered for here .
set this against the monumental background of the region 's industrial history , and you have all the ingredients for an unusual and informative trip . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany home to some of europe 's dirtiest power stations germany contributed heavily to the world wildlife fund 's " dirty thirty " list of most-polluting power stations in the european union , landing six of its coal-fired plants in the top ten .

germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .

those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .

in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .

and it is one of germany ’ s most tradition-steeped regions . when the alps were still considered inhospitable and the black forest was waiting to be discovered by the english and the french , the harz mountains exuded an attraction for artists , students – and not least , poets . the harz mountains , 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- long , 30 kilometers wide , and some 400 million years old , straddle the border between what was once east and west germany , in the central part of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brocken at 1,142 meters the 1,142 meter -lrb- 3,747 feet -rrb- peak called the brockenberg , or brocken mountain , has an ancient reputation of being a haunting ground for witches , goblins and other creatures in the pagan pantheon .
the well-traveled goethe called the brockenberg his favorite mountain , and gave it a place in literary history by using it as the setting for the witches ’ orgiastic sabbath scene in faust . road for romantics ascending the 12-kilometer trail up the brocken from the town of ilsenburg was something of a rite of passage for german romantics .
today the route , which the poet heinrich heine made famous in his verses , is marked by signs showing green rectangles .
not far from the steeply descending ilsefälle valley – there where the stream tumbles over the granite stones – is a monument to heine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasse in goslar the harz range got their name from the forest .
in middle-high german , “ hart ” meant " wooded area . "
back then , though , the forests were beech trees , not the spruce that is currently found .
the beech trees were eventually all cut down for building houses , supporting tunnels and smelting the ore that had been mined from the mountains for 1,000 years .
fast-growing spruce were planted in their place . mass tourism to the harz region developed in the second half of the 19th century , with the advent of the railway system .
since 1992 , the train running from wernigerode to nordhausen also covers the stretch , which was closed in the post-war era , from drei annen hohne to the top of the brockenberg .
at 60.5 kilometers , it ’ s the the longest narrow-gauge steam locomotive route in germany . national park today the area around the brockenberg – or blocksberg , as it is often called in local slang -lrb- " brocken " means " lump " or " block " -rrb- – is a national park .
always a popular destination , some 100,000 people climbed to the brocken plateau in 1900 .
today , though , the numbers lie at over 2 million visitors a year .
in the brocken house , visitors center , the national park offers information on the 1,500 types of plants that live in the high , often wet mountain climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castle in the harz in the eastern part of the harz mountains , the town of schierke was a popular ski resort from the 1920s to the 1940s .
the small , cozy mountain town is not far from the towns of braunlage and wernigerode , directly at the foot of the brocken .
visitors can climb the brockenberg from there on foot - but also on skis , in a horse drawn carriage , or with the brocken train . the birthplace of skiing in harz mountains is in neighboring braunlage .
in 1890 , germany ’ s first ski classes were taught here , and in 1892 , the first winter-sports club was founded .
braunlage has a ski area , an illuminated ski run , an ice rink , cross country trails , and a ski school .
there are some 7,500 beds for tourists in the 5,000 person town . other towns to visit in the region are wernigerode , with its many half-timbered houses , bad lauterberg , which has the leading health spa in northern germany based on the unusual " kneipp " method , and goslar , whose medieval old town is so well preserved that it was named a unesco world heritage site . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de watch out for the bike paths in germany , warns a traveller our readers enjoyed the beer and dirndls , the coffee and the cake while visiting germany and recommend going to heidelberg , the harz region and necker valley .

germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .

take your pick of the workers settlements route or the tycoons ' villas route .
hard-core industry more your thing ?
pick from topics like industrial heritage along the river lippe , or the westphalian coal mining trail .
in the mood for food ?
do n't miss the bread , corn and beer tour .
those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .
today the same tower , built in 1892 by august thyssen , is home to a multimedia water theme museum .
in bottrop , just northeast of oberhausen , the tetrahedron - a 50-meter filigree steel construction - rises up over a former gigantic slag heap .

germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .
tycoons , workers and orange bicycles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water museum each trail highlights a specific theme .
interested in social history ?
take your pick of the workers settlements route or the tycoons ' villas route .
hard-core industry more your thing ?
pick from topics like industrial heritage along the river lippe , or the westphalian coal mining trail .
in the mood for food ?
do n't miss the bread , corn and beer tour .
those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .
today the same tower , built in 1892 by august thyssen , is home to a multimedia water theme museum .
in bottrop , just northeast of oberhausen , the tetrahedron - a 50-meter filigree steel construction - rises up over a former gigantic slag heap .

founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .
today the same tower , built in 1892 by august thyssen , is home to a multimedia water theme museum .
in bottrop , just northeast of oberhausen , the tetrahedron - a 50-meter filigree steel construction - rises up over a former gigantic slag heap .
the ruhr valley has something for everyone - cyclists , hikers and water sports fans will find themselves well catered for here .

surrounded by extensive moors , the region around celle is a nice spot for walks or bike rides , leading through the lowlands and wide fields to luneburg .
impressive house gables characterize the 1,000 year old hanseatic town of lüneburg , telling the stories of the former wealth of the citizens .

surrounded by extensive moors , the region around celle is a nice spot for walks or bike rides , leading through the lowlands and wide fields to luneburg .
impressive house gables characterize the 1,000 year old hanseatic town of lüneburg , telling the stories of the former wealth of the citizens .

visits to germany 's more obscure destinations are rare by foreign tourists and even locals are often deterred .
in the country of autobahns , the latter might be partly to blame . most travelers to germany plan their itineraries around the highlights , but germans also tend not to take advantage of nearby natural and historical treasures .
insufficient infrastructure and a lack of money to promote tourist offerings may be the main hindrances for both .
take germany 's harz mountains in central germany , for example .
it may take a little bit longer to reach the region that 's situated off the beaten track .
germany 's fast inter city express -lrb- ice -rrb- trains are prohibited in protected natural areas and four-lane roads are rare . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the st. stephanus cathedral , seen through the martini church while this does n't stop tourists , cheaper train prices might help to entice more visitors , said anke jessat , the owner of the abtshof hotel in halberstadt , known as the " gateway to the harz . " a small city in saxony-anhalt , it boasts a well preserved cathedral , historic city center and museums dedicated to its literary and cultural heritage .
halberstadt lies just a few miles away from great hiking , historic mountain towns , the unesco world heritage sites in quedlinberg and other sites along saxony-anhalt 's strasse der romantik , or romantic route .
limited customer service jessat said that significant progress has already been made to improve regional infrastructure , such as adding highways and regional train lines .
but funds are lacking to promote the region on a regular basis .
local offerings have limited opening hours , jessat added : often her guests want to visit the halberstadt cathedral or a museum the morning before they depart , but have to leave before the opening time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of goethe und schiller are just one of the many cultural offerings in weimar halberstadt conducted a major promotion campaign for the 1200th anniversary celebration in 2004 , including a john cage music project , but jessat said such efforts are only temporary and tourism promotion drops off afterwards .
ute huch , spokeswoman for halberstadt noted , however , that the activities surrounding the 2004 anniversary did more than just raise the number of overnight stays by 17 percent in the region during the same year .
" these events made us noticed , " she said .
" we are in a good position for tourism to grow . "
in fact , tourism has been growing for awhile - almost doubling in the past six to seven years , she said .
access is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eifel national park thuringia 's efforts to promote its cultural , historical and natural sites have also brought in a lot of foreign visitors .
thuringia enjoys a good deal of high speed train and interstate freeway infrastructure as well as a central location .
but it only has a small airport in erfurt and is somewhat remote for tourists , who come to germany for a short time and just see the highlights .
while promotion is a factor , good roads and train routes are also key . the array of lakes and forests and sorbish -lrb- a slavic minority -rrb- cultural touch of the spreewald between dresden and berlin draws a lot of tourists for day trips - since it 's easily reached by train or car in about an hour .
marianne kilka , marketing director for the spreewald tourism association said poor highway connections have been a problem in the area in the last 15 years , but have recently improved . not just an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle is a must-see for tourists although the eastern german states have significantly less tourism than in the west , some western states are not far ahead of the lowest rankers , such as saxony-anhalt and thuringia , with respective averages of 5.7 and 8.6 million overnight stays per year , according to the german statistics office . these states ' share of tourists is quite small compared with bavaria at about 74 million annual overnight stays . and except for a few iconoclastic tourist attractions such as neuschwanstein castle , germans make up the bulk of the tourism - about 82 percent . the eifel national park , an area rich in mountain hiking trails and volcanic lakes , lies in two states that have fewer tourists than most states in western germany . rhineland-palatinate has just under 20 million overnight stays per year and north rhine-westphalia has about 37 million .
the area has a lot to offer , but highways in the area do n't exactly roll out the welcome signs .
that 's why tourists might have to plan some extra time to check out those equally deserving , but less accessible sites .
or , they should just plan to skip neuschwanstein and the crowds . megan harris send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rescued storybook village the eastern german town of quedlinburg has been a unesco world heritage site since for the past 10 years .
the town was lucky : for a time , many of its unique monuments were in danger of being torn down .

the wild untamed nature of the eifel remains in the form of an accessible but thrilling modern wilderness .
-lrb- august 10 , 2005 -rrb- wartburg castle : immersed in history it has been called the most german of all castles .
but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .

also well worth a visit are berching and greding , which still have the look of medieval towns , and beilngries , famous for its pitched roofs and baroque facades decorated with coats of arms . traces of times gone by perched high on the top of craggy rocks are formidable old castles which offer their visitors the chance to sample opulent banquets of ancient fare and try their hand at medieval games such as were once the pastime of knights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the limes , the ultimate northern border in the roman empire there are also signs of the celts and the romans .

on the contrary , the altmühl valley is one of the most diverse regions in germany . the altmühl valley , which is germany 's largest natural park , was created in 1969 with the aim of protecting a rich landscape of natural delights and picturesque little towns such as the regional capital , eichstätt , dating back centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is dotted with old castles for nature-lovers , the best way to get around is by foot or bicycle , and with 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- of idyllic bike tracks meandering through the region , there are many routes to choose from . the typical altmühl landscape consists of lush forests and gently rolling hills , dotted with juniper bushes and clusters of rocks . one bike tour passes through picturesque little towns and villages , including essing which , set at the foot of high limestone cliffs , is one of the most popular images in the region .
also well worth a visit are berching and greding , which still have the look of medieval towns , and beilngries , famous for its pitched roofs and baroque facades decorated with coats of arms . traces of times gone by perched high on the top of craggy rocks are formidable old castles which offer their visitors the chance to sample opulent banquets of ancient fare and try their hand at medieval games such as were once the pastime of knights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the limes , the ultimate northern border in the roman empire there are also signs of the celts and the romans .
in fact the roman limes borderline runs right through the park and " villa rustica " in möckenlohe gives an insight into country life during the roman era .
and for those who want even more from that chapter of history , the roman museum in weißenburg is full of treasures . the oldest monastic brewery in the world water enthusiasts can cycle all the way along the main-danube canal from kelheim in the south-east , to berching in the north .

visits to germany 's more obscure destinations are rare by foreign tourists and even locals are often deterred .

last year , the registered number of new infections rose by four percent . according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , germany 's premier scientific research and public health agency , there were 2,611 new hiv infections registered in 2006 .
that is a four-percent rise over the previous year , and the highest increase since new infections specifically began being logged in 1993 .
in its " epidemiological bulletin , " rki reported that the number of registered , newly diagnosed hiv infections had thereby risen 81 percent since 2001 .
however , the institute noted that one reason for that major increase is better methods of detecting and documenting infections .
with that adjustment , the rki estimated that the number of actual new infections between 2001 and 2006 rose by around 40 percent .
while big cities still show a high number of registered new infections , the greatest number was seen in smaller towns of 100,000 people or less .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection and documentation have improved that increase was found among homosexual and heterosexual people alike .
also , northern and southern german states were affected most , while the number of registered new infections stagnated or dropped in central and eastern states .
initial diagnoses highest among the middle-aged also the greatest number of initial diagnoses was found among 40- to 60-year-olds .
the group with the greatest number of reported new infections remains homosexual men - at 52 percent ; heterosexuals compose 14.6 percent of the people who registered infections for the first time in 2006 .
women made up 19 percent .
the institute reported that 11 children were born with hiv last year in germany ; in seven of the cases , the mothers had not been tested for the virus .
proper medical , pre-natal care can often prevent a mother-to-child transmission of hiv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children with hiv are abandoned among the 2,611 people reported with new infections last year , 14.8 were uncertain how they were infected with the virus .
education still - or again - a problem according to the thursday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- paper , germany 's federal center for health education said that many europeans believe that aids now primarily affects only developing countries .
younger generations have missed out on the awareness programs of the 1990s , the paper wrote .
the center said that less than 40 percent of the german population considers aids a dangerous disease .
" we may end up gambling away what we what we achieved in education during the ' 90s , " elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , told the faz .
after a long lull , more money is now being invested in preventions campaigns , she said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the battle between patents and patients to ease aids suffering pharmaceuticals have an imperative beyond the profit motive , since they are in the business of saving lives .
despite deep discounts , critics argue that the cost of vital drugs in poor countries is still too high .

germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .
tycoons , workers and orange bicycles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water museum each trail highlights a specific theme .

hard-core industry more your thing ?
pick from topics like industrial heritage along the river lippe , or the westphalian coal mining trail .
in the mood for food ?
do n't miss the bread , corn and beer tour .
those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .
today the same tower , built in 1892 by august thyssen , is home to a multimedia water theme museum .
in bottrop , just northeast of oberhausen , the tetrahedron - a 50-meter filigree steel construction - rises up over a former gigantic slag heap .

germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .

those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .

germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .
tycoons , workers and orange bicycles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water museum each trail highlights a specific theme .
interested in social history ?
take your pick of the workers settlements route or the tycoons ' villas route .
hard-core industry more your thing ?
pick from topics like industrial heritage along the river lippe , or the westphalian coal mining trail .
in the mood for food ?
do n't miss the bread , corn and beer tour .
those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .
today the same tower , built in 1892 by august thyssen , is home to a multimedia water theme museum .
in bottrop , just northeast of oberhausen , the tetrahedron - a 50-meter filigree steel construction - rises up over a former gigantic slag heap .

and it is one of germany ’ s most tradition-steeped regions . when the alps were still considered inhospitable and the black forest was waiting to be discovered by the english and the french , the harz mountains exuded an attraction for artists , students – and not least , poets . the harz mountains , 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- long , 30 kilometers wide , and some 400 million years old , straddle the border between what was once east and west germany , in the central part of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brocken at 1,142 meters the 1,142 meter -lrb- 3,747 feet -rrb- peak called the brockenberg , or brocken mountain , has an ancient reputation of being a haunting ground for witches , goblins and other creatures in the pagan pantheon .

fast-growing spruce were planted in their place . mass tourism to the harz region developed in the second half of the 19th century , with the advent of the railway system .

dw-world.de makes a first excursion through the region from celle to luneburg to hanover and wolfsbuettel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half-timbered house in celle around 500 half-timbered houses from the 16th-18th centuries set the tone in celle 's historic city center , half an hour north of hanover by car .
surrounded by extensive moors , the region around celle is a nice spot for walks or bike rides , leading through the lowlands and wide fields to luneburg .
impressive house gables characterize the 1,000 year old hanseatic town of lüneburg , telling the stories of the former wealth of the citizens .
today , the salt factory , once luneburg 's most important source of revenue , has been transformed into the german salt museum .
the area surrounding both luneburg and celle is well-known for its lush heath that is covered in purple flowers during the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celle palace duke otto ii of brunswik-luneburg founded celle , now home to 73,000 people , in 1292 , the year his palace was built upon which the town was oriented .
as celle was not a target for extensive destruction during the world wars , many historical buildings have been preserved .
biblical inscriptions people carved into the balconies of their houses remain from the time of the reformation , which had already reached the city in 1527 .
baroque glory visitors can climb the 234 steps into the tower of the town church to get a view of the tranquil town from above .
inside the church , the sumptuous stucco works with figures and motives of plants stand-out as an unusual amount of decoration for a protestant church .
the last duke , george william , was a great fan of the baroque and commissioned an italian artist to decorate the church accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal gardens of herrenhausen in hanover but the nobility did n't always have the funds available for such impressive decoration .
instead they hired craftsmen to make fakes : wolfenbuettel palace , a half-timbered house , looks like a stone building ; the alleged marble columns in university of goettingen 's festival room are made of wood and the sculptures in the herrenhausen gardens in hanover were formed from sandstone instead of marble .
nevertheless , the gardens , one of a few remained baroque annexes in germany , are well worth an excursion .
heinrich the lion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunschweig city center thanks to its central location , heinrich the lion settled in braunschweig , around 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- east of hanover .
a bronze lion at burgplatz recalls his reign , as does dankwarderode , the romanesque palace he had built 1173 , one of the few old town buildings to survive world war ii bombing .
legend has it that the scratch marks on the door to braunschweig cathedral , adjacent to dankwarderode palace , were made by a lion that heinrich had saved during a pilgrimage and brought home .
in reality , heinrich took back to braunschweig strong impressions from his journeys which , among others things , inspired him to have the cathedral 's interior decked out with paintings from byzantium .
a copy of heinrich the lion 's illustrated bible is on view in the church - heinrich did n't know how to read .
the herzog august library in neighboring wolfenbuettel has the original as part of its collection of handwritten books , the largest in northern germany , where visitors can marvel at 500,000 books from before 1850 alone . dw staff -lrb- nak -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trier : romans , princes and tourists " roma secunda " , the second rome : that 's what trier was called during the second and third centuries .

on the contrary , the altmühl valley is one of the most diverse regions in germany . the altmühl valley , which is germany 's largest natural park , was created in 1969 with the aim of protecting a rich landscape of natural delights and picturesque little towns such as the regional capital , eichstätt , dating back centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is dotted with old castles for nature-lovers , the best way to get around is by foot or bicycle , and with 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- of idyllic bike tracks meandering through the region , there are many routes to choose from . the typical altmühl landscape consists of lush forests and gently rolling hills , dotted with juniper bushes and clusters of rocks . one bike tour passes through picturesque little towns and villages , including essing which , set at the foot of high limestone cliffs , is one of the most popular images in the region .
also well worth a visit are berching and greding , which still have the look of medieval towns , and beilngries , famous for its pitched roofs and baroque facades decorated with coats of arms . traces of times gone by perched high on the top of craggy rocks are formidable old castles which offer their visitors the chance to sample opulent banquets of ancient fare and try their hand at medieval games such as were once the pastime of knights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the limes , the ultimate northern border in the roman empire there are also signs of the celts and the romans .
in fact the roman limes borderline runs right through the park and " villa rustica " in möckenlohe gives an insight into country life during the roman era .
and for those who want even more from that chapter of history , the roman museum in weißenburg is full of treasures . the oldest monastic brewery in the world water enthusiasts can cycle all the way along the main-danube canal from kelheim in the south-east , to berching in the north .
the canal , which was completed in 1992 , is so much a part of the landscape that it 's hard to believe it 's not a natural waterway .
a boat trip down the canal passes the famous weltenburg monastery , the oldest monastic brewery in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhein-main-danube canal at the weekends , the thousands of tourists who make their way there not only have the chance to sample the eight beers brewed on the stunning baroque premises , but to take in the breath-taking view of the 35-meter -lrb- 115-foot -rrb- high white cliffs through which the danube river forced its way many millennia ago . the crowning glory of a journey through the altmühl valley is a visit eichstätt , home to residenz square , which one travel guide dubs the " most beautiful baroque place north of the alps . "
with its mirrored walls and fine molding depicting tales of greek mythology , the residenz palace itself is also worth a look .

visits to germany 's more obscure destinations are rare by foreign tourists and even locals are often deterred .
in the country of autobahns , the latter might be partly to blame . most travelers to germany plan their itineraries around the highlights , but germans also tend not to take advantage of nearby natural and historical treasures .
insufficient infrastructure and a lack of money to promote tourist offerings may be the main hindrances for both .
take germany 's harz mountains in central germany , for example .
it may take a little bit longer to reach the region that 's situated off the beaten track .
germany 's fast inter city express -lrb- ice -rrb- trains are prohibited in protected natural areas and four-lane roads are rare . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the st. stephanus cathedral , seen through the martini church while this does n't stop tourists , cheaper train prices might help to entice more visitors , said anke jessat , the owner of the abtshof hotel in halberstadt , known as the " gateway to the harz . " a small city in saxony-anhalt , it boasts a well preserved cathedral , historic city center and museums dedicated to its literary and cultural heritage .
halberstadt lies just a few miles away from great hiking , historic mountain towns , the unesco world heritage sites in quedlinberg and other sites along saxony-anhalt 's strasse der romantik , or romantic route .
limited customer service jessat said that significant progress has already been made to improve regional infrastructure , such as adding highways and regional train lines .
but funds are lacking to promote the region on a regular basis .
local offerings have limited opening hours , jessat added : often her guests want to visit the halberstadt cathedral or a museum the morning before they depart , but have to leave before the opening time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of goethe und schiller are just one of the many cultural offerings in weimar halberstadt conducted a major promotion campaign for the 1200th anniversary celebration in 2004 , including a john cage music project , but jessat said such efforts are only temporary and tourism promotion drops off afterwards .
ute huch , spokeswoman for halberstadt noted , however , that the activities surrounding the 2004 anniversary did more than just raise the number of overnight stays by 17 percent in the region during the same year .
" these events made us noticed , " she said .
" we are in a good position for tourism to grow . "
in fact , tourism has been growing for awhile - almost doubling in the past six to seven years , she said .
access is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eifel national park thuringia 's efforts to promote its cultural , historical and natural sites have also brought in a lot of foreign visitors .
thuringia enjoys a good deal of high speed train and interstate freeway infrastructure as well as a central location .
but it only has a small airport in erfurt and is somewhat remote for tourists , who come to germany for a short time and just see the highlights .
while promotion is a factor , good roads and train routes are also key . the array of lakes and forests and sorbish -lrb- a slavic minority -rrb- cultural touch of the spreewald between dresden and berlin draws a lot of tourists for day trips - since it 's easily reached by train or car in about an hour .
marianne kilka , marketing director for the spreewald tourism association said poor highway connections have been a problem in the area in the last 15 years , but have recently improved . not just an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle is a must-see for tourists although the eastern german states have significantly less tourism than in the west , some western states are not far ahead of the lowest rankers , such as saxony-anhalt and thuringia , with respective averages of 5.7 and 8.6 million overnight stays per year , according to the german statistics office . these states ' share of tourists is quite small compared with bavaria at about 74 million annual overnight stays . and except for a few iconoclastic tourist attractions such as neuschwanstein castle , germans make up the bulk of the tourism - about 82 percent . the eifel national park , an area rich in mountain hiking trails and volcanic lakes , lies in two states that have fewer tourists than most states in western germany . rhineland-palatinate has just under 20 million overnight stays per year and north rhine-westphalia has about 37 million .
the area has a lot to offer , but highways in the area do n't exactly roll out the welcome signs .
that 's why tourists might have to plan some extra time to check out those equally deserving , but less accessible sites .
or , they should just plan to skip neuschwanstein and the crowds . megan harris send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany 's rescued storybook village the eastern german town of quedlinburg has been a unesco world heritage site since for the past 10 years .

visits to germany 's more obscure destinations are rare by foreign tourists and even locals are often deterred .
in the country of autobahns , the latter might be partly to blame . most travelers to germany plan their itineraries around the highlights , but germans also tend not to take advantage of nearby natural and historical treasures .
insufficient infrastructure and a lack of money to promote tourist offerings may be the main hindrances for both .
take germany 's harz mountains in central germany , for example .
it may take a little bit longer to reach the region that 's situated off the beaten track .
germany 's fast inter city express -lrb- ice -rrb- trains are prohibited in protected natural areas and four-lane roads are rare . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the st. stephanus cathedral , seen through the martini church while this does n't stop tourists , cheaper train prices might help to entice more visitors , said anke jessat , the owner of the abtshof hotel in halberstadt , known as the " gateway to the harz . " a small city in saxony-anhalt , it boasts a well preserved cathedral , historic city center and museums dedicated to its literary and cultural heritage .
halberstadt lies just a few miles away from great hiking , historic mountain towns , the unesco world heritage sites in quedlinberg and other sites along saxony-anhalt 's strasse der romantik , or romantic route .
limited customer service jessat said that significant progress has already been made to improve regional infrastructure , such as adding highways and regional train lines .
but funds are lacking to promote the region on a regular basis .
local offerings have limited opening hours , jessat added : often her guests want to visit the halberstadt cathedral or a museum the morning before they depart , but have to leave before the opening time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of goethe und schiller are just one of the many cultural offerings in weimar halberstadt conducted a major promotion campaign for the 1200th anniversary celebration in 2004 , including a john cage music project , but jessat said such efforts are only temporary and tourism promotion drops off afterwards .
ute huch , spokeswoman for halberstadt noted , however , that the activities surrounding the 2004 anniversary did more than just raise the number of overnight stays by 17 percent in the region during the same year .
" these events made us noticed , " she said .
" we are in a good position for tourism to grow . "
in fact , tourism has been growing for awhile - almost doubling in the past six to seven years , she said .
access is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eifel national park thuringia 's efforts to promote its cultural , historical and natural sites have also brought in a lot of foreign visitors .
thuringia enjoys a good deal of high speed train and interstate freeway infrastructure as well as a central location .
but it only has a small airport in erfurt and is somewhat remote for tourists , who come to germany for a short time and just see the highlights .
while promotion is a factor , good roads and train routes are also key . the array of lakes and forests and sorbish -lrb- a slavic minority -rrb- cultural touch of the spreewald between dresden and berlin draws a lot of tourists for day trips - since it 's easily reached by train or car in about an hour .
marianne kilka , marketing director for the spreewald tourism association said poor highway connections have been a problem in the area in the last 15 years , but have recently improved . not just an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle is a must-see for tourists although the eastern german states have significantly less tourism than in the west , some western states are not far ahead of the lowest rankers , such as saxony-anhalt and thuringia , with respective averages of 5.7 and 8.6 million overnight stays per year , according to the german statistics office . these states ' share of tourists is quite small compared with bavaria at about 74 million annual overnight stays . and except for a few iconoclastic tourist attractions such as neuschwanstein castle , germans make up the bulk of the tourism - about 82 percent . the eifel national park , an area rich in mountain hiking trails and volcanic lakes , lies in two states that have fewer tourists than most states in western germany . rhineland-palatinate has just under 20 million overnight stays per year and north rhine-westphalia has about 37 million .
the area has a lot to offer , but highways in the area do n't exactly roll out the welcome signs .
that 's why tourists might have to plan some extra time to check out those equally deserving , but less accessible sites .
or , they should just plan to skip neuschwanstein and the crowds . megan harris send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany 's rescued storybook village the eastern german town of quedlinburg has been a unesco world heritage site since for the past 10 years .

on the contrary , the altmühl valley is one of the most diverse regions in germany . the altmühl valley , which is germany 's largest natural park , was created in 1969 with the aim of protecting a rich landscape of natural delights and picturesque little towns such as the regional capital , eichstätt , dating back centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is dotted with old castles for nature-lovers , the best way to get around is by foot or bicycle , and with 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- of idyllic bike tracks meandering through the region , there are many routes to choose from . the typical altmühl landscape consists of lush forests and gently rolling hills , dotted with juniper bushes and clusters of rocks . one bike tour passes through picturesque little towns and villages , including essing which , set at the foot of high limestone cliffs , is one of the most popular images in the region .
also well worth a visit are berching and greding , which still have the look of medieval towns , and beilngries , famous for its pitched roofs and baroque facades decorated with coats of arms . traces of times gone by perched high on the top of craggy rocks are formidable old castles which offer their visitors the chance to sample opulent banquets of ancient fare and try their hand at medieval games such as were once the pastime of knights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the limes , the ultimate northern border in the roman empire there are also signs of the celts and the romans .
in fact the roman limes borderline runs right through the park and " villa rustica " in möckenlohe gives an insight into country life during the roman era .
and for those who want even more from that chapter of history , the roman museum in weißenburg is full of treasures . the oldest monastic brewery in the world water enthusiasts can cycle all the way along the main-danube canal from kelheim in the south-east , to berching in the north .
the canal , which was completed in 1992 , is so much a part of the landscape that it 's hard to believe it 's not a natural waterway .
a boat trip down the canal passes the famous weltenburg monastery , the oldest monastic brewery in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhein-main-danube canal at the weekends , the thousands of tourists who make their way there not only have the chance to sample the eight beers brewed on the stunning baroque premises , but to take in the breath-taking view of the 35-meter -lrb- 115-foot -rrb- high white cliffs through which the danube river forced its way many millennia ago . the crowning glory of a journey through the altmühl valley is a visit eichstätt , home to residenz square , which one travel guide dubs the " most beautiful baroque place north of the alps . "
with its mirrored walls and fine molding depicting tales of greek mythology , the residenz palace itself is also worth a look .

"
when in rome do as the romans and when in germany ... you get the point .
here are some ways to avoid committing a faux pas while in germany . shaking hands shaking hands is an important part of german culture .
it is customary to shake someone 's hand when you meet them for the first time , and at every subsequent meeting as well . at business meetings and some social meetings , it 's expected that each participant shake everyone else 's hand upon arriving and again when leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shake hands with everyone in the group when you arrive and leave kissing in more casual relationships , a friend may offer their cheek instead of their hand .
it 's common for friends in germany to lightly kiss each other on both cheeks when they see each other .
at least they kiss the air next to the other person 's cheek .
though german cheek-kissing is n't quite as ingrained as in other european countries , it can still be intimidating for visitors who may be accustomed to cultures where personal space is more sacred . " sie " and " du " the german language has a formal and informal form of address .
it can take a lot of experience to learn the fine points of using " sie " and " du " but here are a few tips . the formal " sie " is always used together with the last name , for example " herr schmidt " or " frau fischer . "
store clerks , business acquaintances and strangers are always addressed with the " sie " form . when introducing yourself , it is common to give your full name or only your last name .
introducing oneself with only the first name is an indication that you want to be addressed with " du , " which may not be appropriate for the situation . " du " is used among younger people and friends , as well as for children .
it is used together with the first name .
you should not call someone by their first name unless they have offered to be addressed with the informal " du " or if they use " du " and your first name when speaking with you . it is generally the older person , or , in a business setting , the person of higher rank , who offers to switch from " sie " to " du . "
they may do this by re-introducing themselves with their first name . if you are unsure which form to use , listen for which form of address your conversation partner is using with you and use the same form with him or her . titles in addition to " herr " -lrb- mr. -rrb- and " frau " -lrb- ms. -rrb- , academic and noble titles are quite important in germany .
even if it may sound cumbersome , do n't forget to include them when speaking with someone .
they come after " herr " or " frau , " for example " herr dr. keller " or " frau prof. von henkel . "
even double titles , such as " frau prof. dr. schumann , " are n't shortened or omitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try to be on time the word " fräulein , " is an old-fashioned word for " miss " and is no longer in use .

" german aid spending will rise by about 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in 2008 , " merkel told the friday edition of german mass-circulation bild tabloid .
the increase would be about 14 per cent compared to this year .
government officials who asked not to be quoted by name told dpa news service the disclosure was meant to influence the summit , though the boost mainly fulfils commitments already given to increase aid .
merkel said the rise was the biggest of any department in the federal budget .
germany 's 2007 aid budget was about 4.5 billion euros .
" money is n't everything " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel expects recipients to use the money wisely but merkel added that increasing development aid was n't the only thing that had to happen .
" money is n't everything , " merkel said .
" you could pump a vast amount of money into africa and do the completely wrong things with it .
" we have to be partners who are equal in standing , with rights , but also with duties , " she said .
" the money has to get through to the people and really improve things .
that does not always happen . "
more aid to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the aid will continue in coming years heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , germany 's minister for economic cooperation and development , told the friday edition of süddeutsche zeitung that similar top-ups of 750 million euros would follow in the years 2009 to 2011 for a total boost of 3 billion euros .
" it is meant as a signal to the other g8 countries , " she said .
" everyone has to realize that africa 's problems will spread here if we do n't help fix them at source . "
at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , the industrialized nations agreed to gradually boost foreign aid spending to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2015 .
they must reach 0.51 per cent by 2010 .

president bush said the greatest producers of harmful emissions would agree on common goals by late 2008 .
dw 's rolf wenkel was unimpressed . to put it bluntly : the washed-up inhabitant of the white house has n't learned a thing .
this time , too , his ideas are far behind those of the german g8 presidency - and of the international community to set a decisive course against the threatening climate catastrophe .
in heiligendamm , german chancellor angela merkel wants to move the eight leading industrial countries toward binding maximum limits for greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the rise in global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- at most .
to reach that goal , worldwide carbon dioxide emissions would have to fall by 50 percent by 2050 compared to the level in 1990 .
however , the biggest co2 emitter on earth continues to avoid responsibility : thus bush proposes that the united states should only start to draft long-term aims to reduce co2 emissions in the autumn .
each government would then decide for itself how to achieve these aims .
allegedly , china and india , which are merely onlookers at the g8 summit , have already signaled their agreement .
that may be the case .
still , bush , who has been a failure on every level of policy , is offering nothing more than a new spin on an old strategy .
he staves off the international community until fall , with a single press conference debases all the resolutions on the issue prepared for heiligendamm , and , as he has for years , trusts us industry , with its technological edge , to set things straight - the main thing being that economic growth is healthy .
bush appears to be blind .
he 's blind to the 13 us states that combined their efforts in a climate protection initiative .
he 's blind to the innumerable us cities that have long been ignoring the brakesman in the white house .
he 's blind to companies like general electric or general motors that want to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent .
who still takes this man seriously ?
in an initial appraisal , merkel described the president 's initiative as an " important statement " ahead of the meeting in heiligendamm .
what else could she do ?
the rug is being pulled out from under her feet , 12 months of hard bilateral and multilateral negotiations on climate protection may have been wasted , but still , merkel has to remain diplomatic .
she faces a pile of broken glass .
but she did n't cause the damage .

"
when in rome do as the romans and when in germany ... you get the point .
here are some ways to avoid committing a faux pas while in germany . shaking hands shaking hands is an important part of german culture .
it is customary to shake someone 's hand when you meet them for the first time , and at every subsequent meeting as well . at business meetings and some social meetings , it 's expected that each participant shake everyone else 's hand upon arriving and again when leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shake hands with everyone in the group when you arrive and leave kissing in more casual relationships , a friend may offer their cheek instead of their hand .
it 's common for friends in germany to lightly kiss each other on both cheeks when they see each other .
at least they kiss the air next to the other person 's cheek .
though german cheek-kissing is n't quite as ingrained as in other european countries , it can still be intimidating for visitors who may be accustomed to cultures where personal space is more sacred . " sie " and " du " the german language has a formal and informal form of address .
it can take a lot of experience to learn the fine points of using " sie " and " du " but here are a few tips . the formal " sie " is always used together with the last name , for example " herr schmidt " or " frau fischer . "
store clerks , business acquaintances and strangers are always addressed with the " sie " form . when introducing yourself , it is common to give your full name or only your last name .
introducing oneself with only the first name is an indication that you want to be addressed with " du , " which may not be appropriate for the situation . " du " is used among younger people and friends , as well as for children .
it is used together with the first name .
you should not call someone by their first name unless they have offered to be addressed with the informal " du " or if they use " du " and your first name when speaking with you . it is generally the older person , or , in a business setting , the person of higher rank , who offers to switch from " sie " to " du . "
they may do this by re-introducing themselves with their first name . if you are unsure which form to use , listen for which form of address your conversation partner is using with you and use the same form with him or her . titles in addition to " herr " -lrb- mr. -rrb- and " frau " -lrb- ms. -rrb- , academic and noble titles are quite important in germany .
even if it may sound cumbersome , do n't forget to include them when speaking with someone .
they come after " herr " or " frau , " for example " herr dr. keller " or " frau prof. von henkel . "
even double titles , such as " frau prof. dr. schumann , " are n't shortened or omitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try to be on time the word " fräulein , " is an old-fashioned word for " miss " and is no longer in use .
instead , it has been replaced with the more neutral word " frau , " which is equivalent to " ms " and gives no indication of a woman 's marital status .
do not use " fräulein , " as you are likely to offend someone . punctuality german punctuality is more than just a stereotype - it 's also common practice .
being on time is an important part of social etiquette . for business meetings and other important appointments , it is a good idea to arrive a few minutes early .
being late or rushing makes a bad impression - especially when everyone else is punctual . as for private appointments with friends and acquaintances , being " fashionably late " is impolite in germany .
arrive at the time you have arranged , as being tardy may put a damper on the evening .
the more guests there are , however , the wider the window of time is within which it is still appropriate to show up . being invited when you are invited to a private home in germany for dinner or for afternoon coffee and cake , it 's a good idea to bring a small gift for the host or hostess .
flowers are always welcome .

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .
in remarks to the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , the us president rejected speculation that disagreement between officials working on a climate change text for approval at the g8 meeting had soured us-german relations .
the full text of the interview was to be published saturday .
special responsibility in his remarks to the ftd , barroso said the us had " special responsibility as a large emitter of pollutants . "
" it is clear that we need a more ambitious position from the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso did n't mince words barroso 's strong criticism follows merkel 's cautious welcome to the bush initiative .
speaking thursday , merkel said bush 's speech represented " movement " on the previous uncompromising us position on setting greenhouse gas emission targets and an " important step on the road to heiligendamm . "
barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .
" but market mechanisms only work when one has binding targets . "
he expressed the hope the us would see the need to bring the united nations into the process , adding that the g8 summit should provide a launching pad for the un climate protection meeting in bali in december .

german chancellor angela merkel , who is hosting the summit in the northern resort of heiligendamm , has put the issue at the top of the agenda .
bush , however , told a german newspaper he was confident that merkel would back his initiative , put forward in a speech in washington on thursday .
in remarks to the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , the us president rejected speculation that disagreement between officials working on a climate change text for approval at the g8 meeting had soured us-german relations .
the full text of the interview was to be published saturday .
special responsibility in his remarks to the ftd , barroso said the us had " special responsibility as a large emitter of pollutants . "
" it is clear that we need a more ambitious position from the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso did n't mince words barroso 's strong criticism follows merkel 's cautious welcome to the bush initiative .
speaking thursday , merkel said bush 's speech represented " movement " on the previous uncompromising us position on setting greenhouse gas emission targets and an " important step on the road to heiligendamm . "
barroso , who will be present at the g8 meeting , came out strongly in favor of binding emission targets .
" the us is relying strongly on market mechanisms in the battle against climate change , and rightly so , " he said .
" but market mechanisms only work when one has binding targets . "
he expressed the hope the us would see the need to bring the united nations into the process , adding that the g8 summit should provide a launching pad for the un climate protection meeting in bali in december .
beyond bush barroso said bush 's initiative was being superceded by events within the us , where " public opinion on the issue is developing at breathtaking pace . "

the announcement comes a day after the arrest of bosnian serb war-time general zdravko tolimir . " on the basis of very careful and extensive assessment , the commission can resume the negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement , " rehn said after meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and serbian president boris tadic in the german capital , berlin .
merkel , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the partnership negotiations " will be resumed soon . "
a european commission statement said : " the pace of negotiations … will depend on serbia 's continued effective cooperation . "
the comments come after a bosnian serb general accused of genocide during the bosnia war from 1992-95 bosnia was delivered to the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
arrest at the border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdravko tolimir in 1996 zdravko tolimir was arrested on the border between serbia and bosnia 's serb republic in a joint operation by nato and the eu peacekeeping force eufor on thursday .
on friday , he was flown to the netherlands from the bosnian capital sarajevo .
rehn said partnerships talks were likely this month , with an exact date for talks to be set after carla del ponte , chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , returns from belgrade , where she is scheduled to travel on monday .
del ponte 's spokeswoman said the prosecutor would meet the serbian president and the prime minister and would provide the eu and the un security council with a full report on her trip .
war criminal-tracking a condition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mourning loss at a memorial center near srebrenica the eu froze the so-called " stabilization and association agreement " negotiations with serbia on joining the bloc because the balkan state was not fully cooperating with the war crimes tribunal .
this was mainly due to belgrade 's failure to hand over suspects like former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , whom experts say is still hiding in serbia .
during the bosnia war , tolimir was a close aide of mladic 's .
tolimir , a former general , is alleged to have helped mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims at srebrenica in 1995 , an event which un courts have classed as genocide .
radovan karadzic , the bosnian serb wartime political leader , and three other suspects charged with war crimes by the un tribunal also remain at large .
political motivation the eu 's decision to resume talks is seen as a political sweetener to help belgrade swallow the bitter pill of the united nations granting " supervised independence " to the ethnic albanian majority province of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief un war crimes tribunal prosecutor carla del ponte serbia deeply opposes losing kosovo and its ally russia has threatened to use its un security council veto to stop that happening , but belgrade wants to reap the benefits of joining europe 's rich club .
merkel confirmed that deep divisions remained between the serbian government and the eu about the future status of kosovo .
" there are still clear divisions about kosovo , " she said .
serbian president boris tadic said belgrade insisted that granting independence to kosovo was " completely unacceptable . "
he added , however , that " there is still a lot of room to maneuver in negotiations in the hope of finding a compromise .

today , it is a mecca of history and culture . after its mining and steel industries fell into decline in the 1970s , the ruhr valley decided on an unusual strategy for economic renewal : turning the dying industrial landscape into a giant history and technology museum , as well as a top recreation destination .
the gambit appears to have worked .
with its mixture of museums , parks and unique historic industrial sites , the industrial heritage route , which officially opened in 1999 , helped attract some three million visitors to the ruhr valley in 2001 , with the numbers on the rise , according to tourism authorities .
the ruhr valley is situated in the western state of north-rhine westphalia ; it is germany 's most densely populated region .
the route of industrial heritage is more than 400 kilometers long and takes in six museums , 19 industrial sites , and a handful of gardens and historic houses in and around cities such as essen , bottrop and duisburg .
it can be visited on foot , by car or by bike .
tycoons , workers and orange bicycles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water museum each trail highlights a specific theme .
interested in social history ?
take your pick of the workers settlements route or the tycoons ' villas route .
hard-core industry more your thing ?
pick from topics like industrial heritage along the river lippe , or the westphalian coal mining trail .
in the mood for food ?
do n't miss the bread , corn and beer tour .
those who simply want to enjoy nature can take the historical parks and gardens route .
in addition to the streets that make up the route , there is also a linked system of bicycle paths through the area , called the bicycle route of industrial heritage .
at one of 13 stops on the route , sport-loving tourists can rent a bright orange bicycle known as a revier-bike ; children 's bikes are also available .
in terms of specific attractions , one of the most popular is the german mining museum in bochum .
founded in 1930 , it gives visitors insight into the world of coal mining .
beneath a 70-meter tower are 25 exhibition halls .
a display mine reaches 20 meters below ground , providing curious visitors what may well be their only chance to see what life might be like for a miner .
museums : coal , water , and a light show the route 's flagship site - and the site of the visitors ' center - is the bauhaus-style zollverein coal mine industrial complex , in essen .
founded in the 1840s , the zollverein mine was once the largest and most modern colliery mine in europe , employing 5,000 miners at its peak .
since then , the site has been developed into an industrial monument of international importance .
it also houses a lively arts center and hosts regular concerts and special events .
the trail also takes in the town of oberhausen , where authorities have turned a 120-meter high gasometer , formerly a storage facility for gases used in iron and steel production , into the tallest exhibition hall in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo installation in oberhausen .
in 1999 , the artist christo and his wife jeanne-claude used the space to exhibit their installation " the wall " - 13,000 colored oil barrels stacked up in the gasometer 's cylindrical interior .
oberhausen is also home to the popular industrial museum of the rhineland , which documents more than 150 years of the history of iron and steel industry on the rhine and the ruhr .
other favorites are the landscape park duisburg nord and the open air industrial museum in the town of hagen in the southeast of the region .
the landscape park is on the site where in 1899 , the august thyssen company extended its metallurgical plants to the coal fields north of duisburg .
up until its closure in 1985 , the plant produced several kinds of pig iron .
here , do n't miss the chance to visit the site of a former blast furnace and if you can , visit the park at after dark at the weekend , when the skies are illuminated by a light show designed by the british artist jonathan park .
another architectural highlight is the villa huegel , a 200-room residence that once belonged to the krupp industrialist family .
it is situated in extensive parklands overlooking lake baldeney .
something for everyone developers have become experts at bringing the best out of the region 's old industrial hotspots and capitalizing on their historical cachet .
the aquarius water tower in mülheim used to store half a million liters of water .
today the same tower , built in 1892 by august thyssen , is home to a multimedia water theme museum .
in bottrop , just northeast of oberhausen , the tetrahedron - a 50-meter filigree steel construction - rises up over a former gigantic slag heap .

and it is one of germany ’ s most tradition-steeped regions . when the alps were still considered inhospitable and the black forest was waiting to be discovered by the english and the french , the harz mountains exuded an attraction for artists , students – and not least , poets . the harz mountains , 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- long , 30 kilometers wide , and some 400 million years old , straddle the border between what was once east and west germany , in the central part of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brocken at 1,142 meters the 1,142 meter -lrb- 3,747 feet -rrb- peak called the brockenberg , or brocken mountain , has an ancient reputation of being a haunting ground for witches , goblins and other creatures in the pagan pantheon .
the well-traveled goethe called the brockenberg his favorite mountain , and gave it a place in literary history by using it as the setting for the witches ’ orgiastic sabbath scene in faust . road for romantics ascending the 12-kilometer trail up the brocken from the town of ilsenburg was something of a rite of passage for german romantics .
today the route , which the poet heinrich heine made famous in his verses , is marked by signs showing green rectangles .
not far from the steeply descending ilsefälle valley – there where the stream tumbles over the granite stones – is a monument to heine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasse in goslar the harz range got their name from the forest .
in middle-high german , “ hart ” meant " wooded area . "
back then , though , the forests were beech trees , not the spruce that is currently found .
the beech trees were eventually all cut down for building houses , supporting tunnels and smelting the ore that had been mined from the mountains for 1,000 years .
fast-growing spruce were planted in their place . mass tourism to the harz region developed in the second half of the 19th century , with the advent of the railway system .
since 1992 , the train running from wernigerode to nordhausen also covers the stretch , which was closed in the post-war era , from drei annen hohne to the top of the brockenberg .
at 60.5 kilometers , it ’ s the the longest narrow-gauge steam locomotive route in germany . national park today the area around the brockenberg – or blocksberg , as it is often called in local slang -lrb- " brocken " means " lump " or " block " -rrb- – is a national park .
always a popular destination , some 100,000 people climbed to the brocken plateau in 1900 .
today , though , the numbers lie at over 2 million visitors a year .
in the brocken house , visitors center , the national park offers information on the 1,500 types of plants that live in the high , often wet mountain climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castle in the harz in the eastern part of the harz mountains , the town of schierke was a popular ski resort from the 1920s to the 1940s .
the small , cozy mountain town is not far from the towns of braunlage and wernigerode , directly at the foot of the brocken .
visitors can climb the brockenberg from there on foot - but also on skis , in a horse drawn carriage , or with the brocken train . the birthplace of skiing in harz mountains is in neighboring braunlage .
in 1890 , germany ’ s first ski classes were taught here , and in 1892 , the first winter-sports club was founded .
braunlage has a ski area , an illuminated ski run , an ice rink , cross country trails , and a ski school .
there are some 7,500 beds for tourists in the 5,000 person town . other towns to visit in the region are wernigerode , with its many half-timbered houses , bad lauterberg , which has the leading health spa in northern germany based on the unusual " kneipp " method , and goslar , whose medieval old town is so well preserved that it was named a unesco world heritage site . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : watch out for the bike paths in germany , warns a traveller our readers enjoyed the beer and dirndls , the coffee and the cake while visiting germany and recommend going to heidelberg , the harz region and necker valley .

when the bungee has been jumped , the sky dived and the white water rafted - what then ?
if you live in the flatlands of germany , you climb a windmill . in the big cities , they go base jumping , throwing themselves off skyscrapers with only a small parachute on their back .
in the mountains , they drop from helicopters onto the most inaccessible peaks to traverse the breakneck pistes , untouched by human skis . but in klanxbüll , schleswig holstein - a scattered collection of houses on the german-danish border - where there are neither tall buildings nor mountains to tackle , extreme sports enthusiasts have found their own challenge : climbing windmills . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flatlands and sea : your view from 48 meters up being a rather flat landscape , the area around klanxbüll could not be considered a thriving center for climbing fans by any stretch of the imagination .
and it wasn ’ t until a group of entrepreneurial tour operators hit on the idea of promoting the 48-meter tall wind turbines that dot the countryside as the latest in scaling heights . every wednesday afternoon , from may to september , tourists can leave their vertigo behind and take to the summit of one of the region 's 28 windmills . an 18-euro view bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the choice of extreme sports fans in the north of germany after completing the 100-step climb up the attached ladder , the brave climbers are treated to a bird ’ s eye view of the surrounding coastline with its mudflats and the islands of sylt and föhr . the climb , view and adrenaline rush will cost the intrepid climber 18 euros -lrb- $ 24 -rrb- for the privilege , as long as they ’ re over 14 . despite the fact that the climbers are well secured by a safety line to prevent rapid , unplanned descents , the organizers warn that the latest in extreme sports may not be to everyone ’ s tastes .
however , ute rolfs , director of the wattenmeer information center in neighboring wiedingharde , says that so far there have been no accidents . fight your fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleswig-holstein : home to alternative climbers and that is merely one of the positive aspects of the sport .
the climb , for those who accept the challenge to take it , brings its own rewards .

it was especially irked by the refusal of anti-whaling countries to discuss a small amount of commercial whaling by four japanese coastal communities .
japan has made similar statements in previous years .
environmental groups say the meeting paid too little attention to important issues such as the number of cetaceans hit by ships , and climate change .
after securing a narrow majority of members for last year 's meeting - the first majority in 20 years - pro-whaling countries again found themselves in the minority here , and lost a number of key votes .
a recruitment campaign by european and south american countries over the last year brought more members into the iwc to vote for the anti-whaling bloc .
after initial signals that both sides were looking for dialogue and co-operation , the commission closed its four-day annual meeting with familiar acrimony in its later stages .
no compromise japan 's priority for this 59th iwc meeting was to secure a small commercial catch of minke whales for four of its coastal communities with a history and culture of whaling .
japan says its whale hunt is for scientific , not commercial , reasons anti-whaling countries regarded this as a breach of the 21-year moratorium on commercial hunting .
the japanese delegation said the reluctance of anti-whaling nations to discuss a way forward was a disappointment .
" we were not expecting only polite language and dialogue , but the first steps to a mutually acceptable compromise , which we did not see , " said a strained-looking joji morishita , japan 's alternate -lrb- deputy -rrb- whaling commissioner .
japan had offered in return to consider reviewing its plan to include humpback whales , a priority issue for new zealand and australia , in its antarctic hunting programme which it conducts in the name of scientific research .
mr morishita suggested that after australia 's and new zealand 's refusal to talk about a compromise , the humpback hunt would go ahead , though possibly with some unspecified revisions .
we 're greatly interested in the idea of holding a preparatory meeting setting up a conservation and management organisation for cetaceans which ... could be a replacement for iwc akira nakamae scientific whaling a japanese decision to leave the iwc would be a major blow to the organisation 's relevance , as it is now the world 's major whaling nation .
some conservation groups see the threat as a bargaining tool .
another of japan 's alternate commissioners , akira nakamae , declared that establishing a rival organisation was a possibility .
" we 're greatly interested in the idea of holding a preparatory meeting setting up a conservation and management organisation for cetaceans which ... could be a replacement for iwc , " he said .
however , with the iwc enshrined as the world 's sovereign body on whaling , it is not clear what the status of such a new body might be .
issues ignored conservation groups were generally pleased with the passing of a resolution re-affirming the commercial whaling moratorium , and with its condemnation of scientific hunting .
people on both sides of the debate talk about their views in detail but some said issues crucial to whale welfare had been allocated far too little time .
" no time was spent discussing the 3,288 cetaceans that have died worldwide during the course of the meeting in anchorage because of human impacts such as ship strikes , pollution , bycatch and climate change , " said junichi sato of greenpeace .
some of the most threatened cetaceans such as the baiji or yangtze river dolphin , which scientists have declared " effectively extinct " , do not come under the iwc 's mandate .
of the species that do , the most endangered are the north pacific and north atlantic right whales , which now number a few hundred each .
populations were brought low through hunting , but the main threat now comes from being hit by ships .
moving closer many delegates and observers of various viewpoints believe the iwc needs urgent reform .
the iwc is enshrined as the world 's sovereign body on whaling members agreed to hold a special meeting in about six months ' time to examine how to take things forward .
the netherlands has been a prime mover behind reform attempts , and its commissioner giuseppe raaphorst saw reasons for optimism .
" we still have to do some work to get closer to each other , " he told bbc news .
" and i hope that we do n't just talk about our principles , but make practical arrangements to get control over whaling . "
mr morishita said japan had few hopes for the special meeting , but would contribute if it could .
another issue resolved on the final day was denmark 's controversial application for an expansion of subsistence hunting by inuit communities in its territory of greenland .
by a narrow majority the meeting approved a small increase in the minke catch , and , with restrictions , the inclusion of bowhead whales for the first time .
a final sign of japan 's disappointment was the withdrawal of its bid to host the 2009 iwc meeting in yokohama .
it said it had looked forward to hosting a meeting of an organisation which worked normally .

enlarge image a titanic tunnelling machine has arrived in belfast as part of a £ 100m project to renovate the city 's sewers .
the boring machine can move six inches of earth a minute and will shift 250,000 cubic metres of dirt as it digs six miles of new tunnels under belfast .
the 90-metre long mechanical mole is to start work later this month .
the massive cutting face of the machine was put on display in belfast - behind it travels a train to carry away spoil and build the tunnel .
project sponsor bill gowdy said that the project was still on schedule for completion in 2009 and on budget .
he said that the arrival of the machine , which has a crew of eight , was a milestone for the development .
the mammoth machine , which was being used in a 2012 london olympics project , needs 1,100 tonnes of thrust to move forward - about 10 times the thrust of a 747 aeroplane taking off .
the project is costing £ 100m .
enlarge image " a combination of laser guidance and onboard computer controls enables the operators to see the exact location in a 3d environment ensuring that the tunnel stays of a safe , precise and steady track , " mr gowdy said .
he said that most of the work will be carried out deep underground and there should be a minimum of traffic disruption .
mr gowdy added that tests they had carried out indicated that householders should not be disturbed by the tunnelling operation .
the sewers project is one of the most important infrastructure developments in the city .
it will improve the water quality of the lagan and blackstaff rivers and reduce the risk of flooding in the belfast area .

widely regarded as one of - if not the - greatest music albums of modern times , here are some of the stories behind the fab four 's music .
it was the band 's eighth album .
the album was recorded at the famous abbey road studios over a 129-day period , at a cost of £ 25,000 .
pink floyd were working on piper at the gates of dawn in the next studio at the same time .
the idea of making the whole album as if sgt pepper was a real band was believed to be paul mccartney 's .
it was a completely self-contained album which was meant to be played from start to finish .
one critic described the album as " a decisive moment in the history of western civilisation " .
within weeks of the album 's release , jimi hendrix started performing the title track in concert .
it was the first rock album to win grammy awards for album of the year and best contemporary album .
rolling stone magazine rated it number one in the list of the 500 greatest albums of all time .
sir peter blake designed the front cover .
it featured a colourful collage of life-sized cardboard models of famous people , including marlon brando and karl marx .
mae west originally refused to appear on the front cover , but changed her mind after the band wrote to her .
the initial design was altered , deleting hitler and jesus from the image , before the album was released .
it was rumoured that lucy in the sky with diamonds was about the drug lsd .
lennon always denied this , insisting it was inspired by a drawing done by his young son , julian .
the song was still banned by the bbc .
the lyrics to john lennon 's being for the benefit of mr kite were adapted almost word for word from an old circus poster which he bought at an antique shop in kent .
mccartney 's vocals were sped up for the song when i 'm 64 to give it a unique sound .

retailers and wholesalers trading in mobile phones and computer chips will have to change the way they collect and account for value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- .
the new tax policy , known as a " reverse charge " , is aimed at stopping the import and export of these goods as part of so-called " carousel " fraud .
hm revenue & customs -lrb- hmrc -rrb- says it will halt the opportunity for criminals to make bogus vat reclaims .
however some experts say that criminals will simply switch their attention to other high value goods instead .
" it 's not going to be the whole solution , " said stephen coleclough , a leading vat expert from the chartered institute of taxation .
" criminal gangs are likely to swap into other high value items , such as diamonds .
i have even heard of car tyres being used . "
clampdown the uk government has lost billions of pounds to this fraud since the start of the decade as a result of paying out on dishonest claims for vat repayment .
a former head of the hmrc described it as the most serious attack there has ever been on the uk 's tax system .
the government has admitted that in 2005-06 , the last year for which estimates are available , it lost between £ 2bn and £ 3bn .
in the past year though , the authorities seem to have clamped down on it successfully .
according to figures from the office for national statistics , there was £ 17bn worth of trade associated with the fraud in the first six months of the 2006-07 financial year .
but in recent months the value of such trade has dropped to an estimated £ 100m a month .
among the measures the authorities have taken to achieve this have been : the arrest of criminals in the uk and abroad greater scrutiny of new vat registrations more extensive checking of claims for refunds when goods are shipped abroad logging of individual mobile phones each time they are imported or exported .
the opportunity to carry out the fraud exists because of the nature of the eu 's vat system .
contrived transactions traders who import and export goods between eu countries do not have to pay vat .
thus items can be imported , passed through a series of contrived transactions - where vat should be collected - and then exported .
at that point the dishonest trader can submit a claim for the repayment of the tax that was never collected in the first place .
this has happened with the same goods being sent round and round across numerous eu borders - hence the name " carousel " fraud .
the new tax system , which applies in the uk only , will mean that anyone trading in mobile phones and computer chips will no longer have to collect - or pretend to collect - vat until the items reach the end of a chain , for instance by being sold in a shop .
thus anyone who exports the goods will no longer have an apparently legitimate reason for claiming a refund .
" the retailer wo n't be selling a million pounds of mobile phones in one go , and if he has a shop in the high street he 's unlikely not to pay because the tax man knows where to find him , " mr coleclough added .

retailers and wholesalers trading in mobile phones and computer chips will have to change the way they collect and account for value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- .
the new tax policy , known as a " reverse charge " , is aimed at stopping the import and export of these goods as part of so-called " carousel " fraud .
hm revenue & customs -lrb- hmrc -rrb- says it will halt the opportunity for criminals to make bogus vat reclaims .
however some experts say that criminals will simply switch their attention to other high value goods instead .
" it 's not going to be the whole solution , " said stephen coleclough , a leading vat expert from the chartered institute of taxation .
" criminal gangs are likely to swap into other high value items , such as diamonds .
i have even heard of car tyres being used . "
how the carousel works clampdown the uk government has lost billions of pounds to this fraud since the start of the decade as a result of paying out on dishonest claims for vat repayment .
a former head of the hmrc described it as the most serious attack there has ever been on the uk 's tax system .
the government has admitted that in 2005-06 , the last year for which estimates are available , it lost between £ 2bn and £ 3bn .
in the past year though , the authorities seem to have clamped down on it successfully .
according to figures from the office for national statistics , there was £ 17bn worth of trade associated with the fraud in the first six months of the 2006-07 financial year .
but in recent months the value of such trade has dropped to an estimated £ 100m a month .
among the measures the authorities have taken to achieve this have been : the arrest of criminals in the uk and abroad greater scrutiny of new vat registrations more extensive checking of claims for refunds when goods are shipped abroad logging of individual mobile phones each time they are imported or exported .
the opportunity to carry out the fraud exists because of the nature of the eu 's vat system .
contrived transactions traders who import and export goods between eu countries do not have to pay vat .
thus items can be imported , passed through a series of contrived transactions - where vat should be collected - and then exported .
at that point the dishonest trader can submit a claim for the repayment of the tax that was never collected in the first place .
this has happened with the same goods being sent round and round across numerous eu borders - hence the name " carousel " fraud .
the new tax system , which applies in the uk only , will mean that anyone trading in mobile phones and computer chips will no longer have to collect - or pretend to collect - vat until the items reach the end of a chain , for instance by being sold in a shop .
thus anyone who exports the goods will no longer have an apparently legitimate reason for claiming a refund .
" the retailer wo n't be selling a million pounds of mobile phones in one go , and if he has a shop in the high street he 's unlikely not to pay because the tax man knows where to find him , " mr coleclough added .

justice secretary kenny macaskill has said he is looking at ways of encouraging responsible sales and targeting binge drinking problems .
the move could include measures to stop buy-one-get-one-free deals in supermarkets and off licences .
mr macaskill said buying alcohol was now seen as no different than buying " soap powder and bananas " .
he told the herald newspaper : " there 's something perverse in scotland that a bottle of cider can cost less than a bottle of water .
" of course we all like a bargain , but it shows we have come to think of alcohol as no different from bananas or soap powder .
that can not be right . "
" we are happy to discuss any ideas but we think the solution that mr macaskill suggests is the wrong one " gordon macrae scottish grocers ' federation the secretary criticised one of his local supermarkets for selling 60 bottles or cans of beer for £ 20 under a buy two get one free offer - with beer working out at just 43p a pint .
gordon macrae from the scottish grocers ' federation said the scottish executive should impose a proof-of-age scheme rather than criticise shopkeepers .
he said he believed the biggest problem was retailers selling alcohol at a loss as a way of luring customers into the store .
mr macrae said : " we are happy to discuss any ideas but we think the solution that mr macaskill suggests is the wrong one .

staff at the ritzy cinema in brixton have demanded a better deal after rejecting a pay offer of £ 5.41 - six pence above the minimum wage .
they said that while ticket prices have increased from just over £ 5 to about £ 8 per film in the past few years , that has not been reflected in wages .
cinema managers said tight profit margins prevented them offering the pay rise demanded by staff .
this is the second strike by workers at the venue after staff staged a walkout last week .
poverty line jackie brett-holt , the bectu union representative for staff at the cinema , said : " if you 're going to own and run a business in london you have to aware that the poverty line is £ 6.25 and that the living wage is £ 7.20 . "
" now we 're not asking for this overnight .
we 're asking for a three to five year settlement that city screen -lrb- cinema managers -rrb- can work into their budget and they 've refused to do that . "
in a statement city screen said that from each £ 8 ticket sold , only £ 2.56 went to the cinema as profit .
" we are disappointed that our staff are taking action to disrupt screenings at the ritzy but the economics of an independent cinema make it impossible to meet their demand for a 35 % pay rise .
" ritzy staff are paid more than minimum wage but their pay rise has been delayed by the negotiation process , despite an offer to make an interim payment . "
