but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .
24 .
the transrapid will hover on a track above the ground and will travel at speeds up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour .
the 37-kilometer -lrb- 23-mile -rrb- route is scheduled to be completed by 2014 .
technology made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's " parting gift " the project is seen by critics as a " parting gift " for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
after 14 in power , stoiber will step down next month .
stoiber denied that the transrapid was being done as a personal favor , saying tuesday that the project was the " guiding light for high technology made in germany . "
german engineering giants siemens and thyssenkrupp developed the project .
so far , the technology has not been broadly adopted due to safety concerns .
in september 2006 , 23 people died and 11 were injured when a transrapid crashed into a maintenance vehicle during a test run near the western german city of osnabrück .
currently only china has an operational transrapid track .
it runs between shanghai and the city 's airport .
government warns of cost overruns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only operational transrapid is in shanghai as part of the deal , the german government will pay no more than 925 million euros for the magnetic levitation train and has stipulated it will not be responsible for cost overruns .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .
the city of munich is also unhappy about the tranrapid .
munich 's socialist mayor , christian ude , said he will fight in court against the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accident last year killed 23 people " naturally , the regional capital of munich will initiate legal measures against the plan 's official approval , " ude was quoted as saying by reuters news agency .
while this week 's financial agreement was an important step , cdu expert steffen kampeter said it does n't mean the project will get a green light in the end .
the recent agreement brought the project " nearer to being financially viable , " kampeter told the dpa news agency tuesday in berlin .
" the devil is in the details , " he said .
stoiber said he was confident the project would go forward despite ongoing opposition .
" nobody will reverse this step , " he said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german media report said the government no longer questioned the project .
now , just the financial details need to be clarified .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 25.09.2007 german anti-terror measures fight for life as opposition grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble has proposed many of the anti-terror measures under debate germany 's interior and defense ministries have been busy rolling out potential anti-terror measures over the past weeks .
but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "
biometrics up and running despite opposition in another move to increase security , germany will start adding fingerprints to its biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fingerprints will be added to the biometric passports opponents of the biometric system and a proposed biometric database accuse the federal and state governments of establishing the systems despite the public 's privacy and security concerns and with little open debate . meanwhile , supporters say biometric passports create an unrivaled level of security and protection against the counterfeit identification papers often used by terrorists and other criminals .
" many germans see the benefits of this increased security and accept the collection of data , " hofmann said .
" people have got used to this as part of life .
some , however , see this as part of the creation of a global surveillance structure where everybody 's whereabouts are known .
but whichever way you look at it , biometrics are a reality .
it 's a done deal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "
biometrics up and running despite opposition in another move to increase security , germany will start adding fingerprints to its biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fingerprints will be added to the biometric passports opponents of the biometric system and a proposed biometric database accuse the federal and state governments of establishing the systems despite the public 's privacy and security concerns and with little open debate . meanwhile , supporters say biometric passports create an unrivaled level of security and protection against the counterfeit identification papers often used by terrorists and other criminals .
" many germans see the benefits of this increased security and accept the collection of data , " hofmann said .
" people have got used to this as part of life .
some , however , see this as part of the creation of a global surveillance structure where everybody 's whereabouts are known .
but whichever way you look at it , biometrics are a reality .
it 's a done deal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .
24 .
the transrapid will hover on a track above the ground and will travel at speeds up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour .
the 37-kilometer -lrb- 23-mile -rrb- route is scheduled to be completed by 2014 .
technology made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's " parting gift " the project is seen by critics as a " parting gift " for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
after 14 in power , stoiber will step down next month .
stoiber denied that the transrapid was being done as a personal favor , saying tuesday that the project was the " guiding light for high technology made in germany . "
german engineering giants siemens and thyssenkrupp developed the project .
so far , the technology has not been broadly adopted due to safety concerns .
in september 2006 , 23 people died and 11 were injured when a transrapid crashed into a maintenance vehicle during a test run near the western german city of osnabrück .
currently only china has an operational transrapid track .
it runs between shanghai and the city 's airport .
government warns of cost overruns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only operational transrapid is in shanghai as part of the deal , the german government will pay no more than 925 million euros for the magnetic levitation train and has stipulated it will not be responsible for cost overruns .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .
the city of munich is also unhappy about the tranrapid .
munich 's socialist mayor , christian ude , said he will fight in court against the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accident last year killed 23 people " naturally , the regional capital of munich will initiate legal measures against the plan 's official approval , " ude was quoted as saying by reuters news agency .
while this week 's financial agreement was an important step , cdu expert steffen kampeter said it does n't mean the project will get a green light in the end .
the recent agreement brought the project " nearer to being financially viable , " kampeter told the dpa news agency tuesday in berlin .
" the devil is in the details , " he said .
stoiber said he was confident the project would go forward despite ongoing opposition .
" nobody will reverse this step , " he said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the loyalty of the chinese fans to germany is unlikely to come into question on wednesday when norway , narrow 1-0 winners over the hosts , will feel the heat of the locals after what was seen to be a lucky quarter-final win .
the noise is expected to be only marginally less than if the chinese were meeting germany themselves for a place in the world cup final .
norway stands between holders and final germany will be looking to feed off whatever support they can get .
while they have only really struggled once in the tournament so far , laboring to a 0-0 draw with england , the norwegians are tough customers who are far from unknown to the world champions .
the germans and norwegians have faced off 28 times in the past , with 12 going germany 's way , 11 to norway and five draws .
" norway always belongs among the top nations , " said prinz .
" it will be the same here .
we can say from intense experience that we expect nothing less . "

but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .
24 .
the transrapid will hover on a track above the ground and will travel at speeds up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour .
the 37-kilometer -lrb- 23-mile -rrb- route is scheduled to be completed by 2014 .
technology made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's " parting gift " the project is seen by critics as a " parting gift " for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
after 14 in power , stoiber will step down next month .
stoiber denied that the transrapid was being done as a personal favor , saying tuesday that the project was the " guiding light for high technology made in germany . "
german engineering giants siemens and thyssenkrupp developed the project .
so far , the technology has not been broadly adopted due to safety concerns .
in september 2006 , 23 people died and 11 were injured when a transrapid crashed into a maintenance vehicle during a test run near the western german city of osnabrück .
currently only china has an operational transrapid track .
it runs between shanghai and the city 's airport .
government warns of cost overruns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only operational transrapid is in shanghai as part of the deal , the german government will pay no more than 925 million euros for the magnetic levitation train and has stipulated it will not be responsible for cost overruns .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .
the city of munich is also unhappy about the tranrapid .
munich 's socialist mayor , christian ude , said he will fight in court against the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accident last year killed 23 people " naturally , the regional capital of munich will initiate legal measures against the plan 's official approval , " ude was quoted as saying by reuters news agency .
while this week 's financial agreement was an important step , cdu expert steffen kampeter said it does n't mean the project will get a green light in the end .
the recent agreement brought the project " nearer to being financially viable , " kampeter told the dpa news agency tuesday in berlin .
" the devil is in the details , " he said .
stoiber said he was confident the project would go forward despite ongoing opposition .
" nobody will reverse this step , " he said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china wants to make clear on a diplomatic level that the dalai lama meeting was not acceptable , but german diplomats have also tried to show to their chinese counterparts that this should not be the end of the dialogue and that we should get back to business as usual .
after all , this meeting -lsb- between merkel and the dalai lama -rsb- is not a core issue of german-chinese relations and should not be treated as such . was merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama a mistake ? the meeting was perfectly okay , but the place makes a difference .

let me give you one example .
we are all watching what is going on in burma right now .

it 's partly economic influence , but it 's far more .

on tuesday , china said it had damaged ties between the two countries and called on berlin to remedy the situation . dw-world.de spoke with china expert eberhard sandschneider of the german council on foreign relations in berlin about how sino-german relations could develop after the controversial meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama - tibet 's spiritual leader - at the chancellery on sunday , sept .
23 . dw-world.de : china cancelled two meetings with germany - one was a justice conference in munich , another was a traditional breakfast meeting between china 's and germany 's foreign ministers on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york .

china wants to make clear on a diplomatic level that the dalai lama meeting was not acceptable , but german diplomats have also tried to show to their chinese counterparts that this should not be the end of the dialogue and that we should get back to business as usual .
after all , this meeting -lsb- between merkel and the dalai lama -rsb- is not a core issue of german-chinese relations and should not be treated as such . was merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama a mistake ? the meeting was perfectly okay , but the place makes a difference .

let me give you one example .

if one assumes that it is in our interest to have china cooperate , then it would make sense not to prevent cooperative behavior on the part of beijing .
it 's partly economic influence , but it 's far more .

it is in the interest of our chancellor or even of the german government to be in dialogue with the dalai lama .
on the other hand , china has other interests , and whenever you have clashes of this kind , then a little more diplomacy is needed not to irritate bilateral relations .

but , it also knows that whenever it comes to international coordination , europe is important and germany is important within europe , so there is a mutual interest in getting these things in order as soon as possible . you mentioned burma , what could china be doing to help ease the tensions there ? china is the only international actor who has some kind of pull with the junta in burma .
no other countries do .
china 's interests are clear : it cooperates both economically and militarily with burma .
so , it is in china 's interests to maintain stability there .
the chinese government certainly does not care whether it is a military leadership in burma or not , just as it does n't care about military regimes in africa .
but stability in the region is critical to china , and chinese representatives have made clear that they want the burmese military leaders to talk with the demonstrators and not shoot at them .
it remains to be seen whether or not china will take action . interview : louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .
24 .
the transrapid will hover on a track above the ground and will travel at speeds up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour .
the 37-kilometer -lrb- 23-mile -rrb- route is scheduled to be completed by 2014 .
technology made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's " parting gift " the project is seen by critics as a " parting gift " for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
after 14 in power , stoiber will step down next month .
stoiber denied that the transrapid was being done as a personal favor , saying tuesday that the project was the " guiding light for high technology made in germany . "
german engineering giants siemens and thyssenkrupp developed the project .
so far , the technology has not been broadly adopted due to safety concerns .
in september 2006 , 23 people died and 11 were injured when a transrapid crashed into a maintenance vehicle during a test run near the western german city of osnabrück .
currently only china has an operational transrapid track .
it runs between shanghai and the city 's airport .
government warns of cost overruns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only operational transrapid is in shanghai as part of the deal , the german government will pay no more than 925 million euros for the magnetic levitation train and has stipulated it will not be responsible for cost overruns .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .
the city of munich is also unhappy about the tranrapid .
munich 's socialist mayor , christian ude , said he will fight in court against the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accident last year killed 23 people " naturally , the regional capital of munich will initiate legal measures against the plan 's official approval , " ude was quoted as saying by reuters news agency .
while this week 's financial agreement was an important step , cdu expert steffen kampeter said it does n't mean the project will get a green light in the end .
the recent agreement brought the project " nearer to being financially viable , " kampeter told the dpa news agency tuesday in berlin .
" the devil is in the details , " he said .
stoiber said he was confident the project would go forward despite ongoing opposition .
" nobody will reverse this step , " he said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 .
she spoke at an unprecedented one-day united nations climate conference in new york . germany 's chancellor repeated her call for global solutions to cutting co2 emissions , encouraging countries to begin looking for a way to move forward efforts to combat climate change .
negotiating a successor to the kyoto protocol - a treaty which sets targets for industrial nations to reduce carbon emissions - is of crucial importance , merkel said , speaking before a un climate conference .
" it 's not only the dry facts and numbers that call us to negotiate , but also the question of in what future we want to live , " she said .
" for me , this is not only an economic imperative , but also a moral one . "
merkel called for global co2 emissions , a major man-made factor that contributes to global warming , to be halved by 2050 .
carbon trading suggested as a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the un to take the lead on combating climate change merkel suggested that a global carbon-trading scheme , which places a price on industries ' carbon-dioxide emissions , should play a " central role " in plans to fight global warming .
" only when greenhouse gases have a price will climate friendly technologies really become economically attractive , " she said .
her comments were echoed by others , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in 2005 , the european union introduced the world 's largest carbon trading scheme .
the plan has not worked as expected , since some countries gave their polluters large numbers of carbon credits .
yet europe still feels carbon trading is the way forward .
" our ultimate success will depend on developing the carbon market , " barroso said at the un climate conference monday .
looking beyond the kyoto protocol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean fuel is a necessity the eu has agreed to reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , but both merkel and barroso said that figure could be raised to 30 percent if a binding international deal included other regions .
" industrialized countries must play a pioneering role here , " merkel said .
" they have to set themselves ambitious reduction targets .
they have to demonstrate how they intend to achieve these targets . "
french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major polluters to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2050 .
he advocated the use of nuclear energy , france 's main power source , as a possible solution .
" it is not a question of choice between growth and protecting our world , " sarkozy said .
" we need clean growth .
a new economy must be invented . "
un secretary general ban ki-moon said monday 's conference achieved its goal of building momentum ahead of a critical december meeting in bali , indonesia .
there , negotiators will begin talks to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" this event has sent a powerful signal to the world ... that there is a will and determination at the highest level to break with the past and act decisively , " ban said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 25.09.2007 german bishop criticizes reassignment of pedophilic priest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the priest was assigned to this parish church after being convicted of pedophiliac crimes the host of a bishops ' conference in southern germany has taken one of his peers to task for reassigning a priest with a history of sexual abuse to a new parish .
he also called for more openness on this sensitive issue . the bishop of fulda , heinz josef algermissen , said his colleague bishop gerhard ludwig müller of regensburg made a mistake in offering a second chance to a priest with a history of pedophilia .
" if something has happened in the past with children , a new start should only be allowed at a distance from children , " algermissen told the bayern2 radio station .
the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .
müller reassigned the priest to the parish of riekofen , a village near regensburg , after that sentence expired .
police then arrested 39-year-old peter k. on aug .
30 for suspected sexual offences committed between 2003 and 2006 , and riekofen was given a new priest .
" nothing worse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop algermissen has been critical of what happened algermissen 's criticism of his colleague was all the more noteworthy because it came on the eve of the ongoing conference of german bishops in fulda .
algermissen called for an open discussion of the riekofen affair .
" there 's nothing worse for a bishop than a man of the cloth abusing people 's trust , " algermissen said .
" something like this is a true blow , and in view of what happened , you can feel half-sick . "
müller has justified his decision to reassign peter k. by saying he was guided by psychological evaluations showing that the priest did not have a pedophile fixation .
müller denies responsibility for any grotesque lapses in judgment .
" even a bishop ca n't rule out the possibility of a priest misusing the freedom -lsb- of his position -rsb- , " müller said in an interview with the catholic news agency kna .
" priests are not marionettes .
they themselves are responsible for what they do with parishioners . " calls for bishop 's resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is not getting involved at the moment but others remain outraged and were calling for müller to step down .
in a press conference , the head of a german initiative representing victims of abuse by priests , johannes heibel , said müller 's decision to reassign peter k. was " more than scandalous . "
german psychoanalyst micha hilgers concurred , telling the dpa news agency that assigning peter k. to riekofen was " completely irresponsible . "
" it 's practically bizarre to put him in close proximity again to the situation in which he committed a crime , " hilgers added .
" therapy is possible , but a cure is not . "
recurring problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop müller said priests are responsible for their own behavior long a topic shrouded by secrecy , cases of pederasty among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not got involved in the riekofen affair .
" it 's a german matter , " dpa news agency quoted a source within radio vatican as saying .
" the bishop will have to justify his behavior to his fellow bishops . " in 2002 , the german bishops acted to head off such a crisis , with the conference of bishops issuing guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . müller has denied breaching the guideline , saying he had a christian duty to forgive and had been convinced that the paedophile priest had reformed his ways . but hilgers and others worry the priesthood may inherently attract people susceptible to pederasty and say the church needs to be more proactive about preventing cases like the one in riekofen .
" the bishop and the bishopric have a duty to keep an especially keen eye out for things like this , " hilgers told dpa .
" they should be conscious of the special risk .
that has been criminally neglected . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also called for more openness on this sensitive issue . the bishop of fulda , heinz josef algermissen , said his colleague bishop gerhard ludwig müller of regensburg made a mistake in offering a second chance to a priest with a history of pedophilia .
" if something has happened in the past with children , a new start should only be allowed at a distance from children , " algermissen told the bayern2 radio station .
the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .
müller reassigned the priest to the parish of riekofen , a village near regensburg , after that sentence expired .
police then arrested 39-year-old peter k. on aug .
30 for suspected sexual offences committed between 2003 and 2006 , and riekofen was given a new priest .
" nothing worse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop algermissen has been critical of what happened algermissen 's criticism of his colleague was all the more noteworthy because it came on the eve of the ongoing conference of german bishops in fulda .
algermissen called for an open discussion of the riekofen affair .
" there 's nothing worse for a bishop than a man of the cloth abusing people 's trust , " algermissen said .
" something like this is a true blow , and in view of what happened , you can feel half-sick . "
müller has justified his decision to reassign peter k. by saying he was guided by psychological evaluations showing that the priest did not have a pedophile fixation .
müller denies responsibility for any grotesque lapses in judgment .
" even a bishop ca n't rule out the possibility of a priest misusing the freedom -lsb- of his position -rsb- , " müller said in an interview with the catholic news agency kna .
" priests are not marionettes .
they themselves are responsible for what they do with parishioners . " calls for bishop 's resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is not getting involved at the moment but others remain outraged and were calling for müller to step down .
in a press conference , the head of a german initiative representing victims of abuse by priests , johannes heibel , said müller 's decision to reassign peter k. was " more than scandalous . "
german psychoanalyst micha hilgers concurred , telling the dpa news agency that assigning peter k. to riekofen was " completely irresponsible . "
" it 's practically bizarre to put him in close proximity again to the situation in which he committed a crime , " hilgers added .
" therapy is possible , but a cure is not . "
recurring problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop müller said priests are responsible for their own behavior long a topic shrouded by secrecy , cases of pederasty among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not got involved in the riekofen affair .
" it 's a german matter , " dpa news agency quoted a source within radio vatican as saying .
" the bishop will have to justify his behavior to his fellow bishops . " in 2002 , the german bishops acted to head off such a crisis , with the conference of bishops issuing guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . müller has denied breaching the guideline , saying he had a christian duty to forgive and had been convinced that the paedophile priest had reformed his ways . but hilgers and others worry the priesthood may inherently attract people susceptible to pederasty and say the church needs to be more proactive about preventing cases like the one in riekofen .
" the bishop and the bishopric have a duty to keep an especially keen eye out for things like this , " hilgers told dpa .
" they should be conscious of the special risk .
that has been criminally neglected . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

before people start accusing the chinese of rallying against their conquerors out of sour grapes , it must be pointed out that whenever china has n't been playing , the local fans have been cheering germany on in astounding numbers .
an expected 55,000 will be singing for the german team in tianjin , a similar number to those chinese who turned out to watch all of germany 's matches so far .
" there always seems to be more chinese support at our games than at any of the other games in which the chinese are n't playing , " said german goalkeeper nadine angerer .
" it 's pretty clear that german soccer is liked here very much . "
every self-respecting chinese fan knows about the careers of legends such as germany 's most-capped player lothar matthäus and " kaiser " franz beckenbauer but since the women 's team arrived to begin their title defense in china , the locals have found a new team of teutonic idols .

the loyalty of the chinese fans to germany is unlikely to come into question on wednesday when norway , narrow 1-0 winners over the hosts , will feel the heat of the locals after what was seen to be a lucky quarter-final win .

" if something has happened in the past with children , a new start should only be allowed at a distance from children , " algermissen told the bayern2 radio station .
the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .
müller reassigned the priest to the parish of riekofen , a village near regensburg , after that sentence expired .
police then arrested 39-year-old peter k. on aug .
30 for suspected sexual offences committed between 2003 and 2006 , and riekofen was given a new priest .
" nothing worse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop algermissen has been critical of what happened algermissen 's criticism of his colleague was all the more noteworthy because it came on the eve of the ongoing conference of german bishops in fulda .
algermissen called for an open discussion of the riekofen affair .
" there 's nothing worse for a bishop than a man of the cloth abusing people 's trust , " algermissen said .
" something like this is a true blow , and in view of what happened , you can feel half-sick . "
müller has justified his decision to reassign peter k. by saying he was guided by psychological evaluations showing that the priest did not have a pedophile fixation .
müller denies responsibility for any grotesque lapses in judgment .
" even a bishop ca n't rule out the possibility of a priest misusing the freedom -lsb- of his position -rsb- , " müller said in an interview with the catholic news agency kna .
" priests are not marionettes .
they themselves are responsible for what they do with parishioners . " calls for bishop 's resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is not getting involved at the moment but others remain outraged and were calling for müller to step down .
in a press conference , the head of a german initiative representing victims of abuse by priests , johannes heibel , said müller 's decision to reassign peter k. was " more than scandalous . "
german psychoanalyst micha hilgers concurred , telling the dpa news agency that assigning peter k. to riekofen was " completely irresponsible . "
" it 's practically bizarre to put him in close proximity again to the situation in which he committed a crime , " hilgers added .
" therapy is possible , but a cure is not . "
recurring problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop müller said priests are responsible for their own behavior long a topic shrouded by secrecy , cases of pederasty among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not got involved in the riekofen affair .
" it 's a german matter , " dpa news agency quoted a source within radio vatican as saying .
" the bishop will have to justify his behavior to his fellow bishops . " in 2002 , the german bishops acted to head off such a crisis , with the conference of bishops issuing guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . müller has denied breaching the guideline , saying he had a christian duty to forgive and had been convinced that the paedophile priest had reformed his ways . but hilgers and others worry the priesthood may inherently attract people susceptible to pederasty and say the church needs to be more proactive about preventing cases like the one in riekofen .
" the bishop and the bishopric have a duty to keep an especially keen eye out for things like this , " hilgers told dpa .
" they should be conscious of the special risk .
that has been criminally neglected . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 25.09.2007 german anti-terror measures fight for life as opposition grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble has proposed many of the anti-terror measures under debate germany 's interior and defense ministries have been busy rolling out potential anti-terror measures over the past weeks .
but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "
biometrics up and running despite opposition in another move to increase security , germany will start adding fingerprints to its biometric passports from nov .

" many germans see the benefits of this increased security and accept the collection of data , " hofmann said .
" people have got used to this as part of life .

but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "
biometrics up and running despite opposition in another move to increase security , germany will start adding fingerprints to its biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fingerprints will be added to the biometric passports opponents of the biometric system and a proposed biometric database accuse the federal and state governments of establishing the systems despite the public 's privacy and security concerns and with little open debate . meanwhile , supporters say biometric passports create an unrivaled level of security and protection against the counterfeit identification papers often used by terrorists and other criminals .
" many germans see the benefits of this increased security and accept the collection of data , " hofmann said .
" people have got used to this as part of life .
some , however , see this as part of the creation of a global surveillance structure where everybody 's whereabouts are known .
but whichever way you look at it , biometrics are a reality .
it 's a done deal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also called for more openness on this sensitive issue . the bishop of fulda , heinz josef algermissen , said his colleague bishop gerhard ludwig müller of regensburg made a mistake in offering a second chance to a priest with a history of pedophilia .
" if something has happened in the past with children , a new start should only be allowed at a distance from children , " algermissen told the bayern2 radio station .
the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .
müller reassigned the priest to the parish of riekofen , a village near regensburg , after that sentence expired .
police then arrested 39-year-old peter k. on aug .
30 for suspected sexual offences committed between 2003 and 2006 , and riekofen was given a new priest .
" nothing worse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop algermissen has been critical of what happened algermissen 's criticism of his colleague was all the more noteworthy because it came on the eve of the ongoing conference of german bishops in fulda .
algermissen called for an open discussion of the riekofen affair .
" there 's nothing worse for a bishop than a man of the cloth abusing people 's trust , " algermissen said .
" something like this is a true blow , and in view of what happened , you can feel half-sick . "
müller has justified his decision to reassign peter k. by saying he was guided by psychological evaluations showing that the priest did not have a pedophile fixation .
müller denies responsibility for any grotesque lapses in judgment .
" even a bishop ca n't rule out the possibility of a priest misusing the freedom -lsb- of his position -rsb- , " müller said in an interview with the catholic news agency kna .
" priests are not marionettes .
they themselves are responsible for what they do with parishioners . " calls for bishop 's resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is not getting involved at the moment but others remain outraged and were calling for müller to step down .
in a press conference , the head of a german initiative representing victims of abuse by priests , johannes heibel , said müller 's decision to reassign peter k. was " more than scandalous . "
german psychoanalyst micha hilgers concurred , telling the dpa news agency that assigning peter k. to riekofen was " completely irresponsible . "
" it 's practically bizarre to put him in close proximity again to the situation in which he committed a crime , " hilgers added .
" therapy is possible , but a cure is not . "
recurring problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop müller said priests are responsible for their own behavior long a topic shrouded by secrecy , cases of pederasty among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not got involved in the riekofen affair .
" it 's a german matter , " dpa news agency quoted a source within radio vatican as saying .
" the bishop will have to justify his behavior to his fellow bishops . " in 2002 , the german bishops acted to head off such a crisis , with the conference of bishops issuing guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . müller has denied breaching the guideline , saying he had a christian duty to forgive and had been convinced that the paedophile priest had reformed his ways . but hilgers and others worry the priesthood may inherently attract people susceptible to pederasty and say the church needs to be more proactive about preventing cases like the one in riekofen .
" the bishop and the bishopric have a duty to keep an especially keen eye out for things like this , " hilgers told dpa .
" they should be conscious of the special risk .
that has been criminally neglected . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also called for more openness on this sensitive issue . the bishop of fulda , heinz josef algermissen , said his colleague bishop gerhard ludwig müller of regensburg made a mistake in offering a second chance to a priest with a history of pedophilia .
" if something has happened in the past with children , a new start should only be allowed at a distance from children , " algermissen told the bayern2 radio station .
the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .
müller reassigned the priest to the parish of riekofen , a village near regensburg , after that sentence expired .
police then arrested 39-year-old peter k. on aug .

" nothing worse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop algermissen has been critical of what happened algermissen 's criticism of his colleague was all the more noteworthy because it came on the eve of the ongoing conference of german bishops in fulda .
algermissen called for an open discussion of the riekofen affair .
" there 's nothing worse for a bishop than a man of the cloth abusing people 's trust , " algermissen said .
" something like this is a true blow , and in view of what happened , you can feel half-sick . "
müller has justified his decision to reassign peter k. by saying he was guided by psychological evaluations showing that the priest did not have a pedophile fixation .
müller denies responsibility for any grotesque lapses in judgment .
" even a bishop ca n't rule out the possibility of a priest misusing the freedom -lsb- of his position -rsb- , " müller said in an interview with the catholic news agency kna .
" priests are not marionettes .

in a press conference , the head of a german initiative representing victims of abuse by priests , johannes heibel , said müller 's decision to reassign peter k. was " more than scandalous . "
german psychoanalyst micha hilgers concurred , telling the dpa news agency that assigning peter k. to riekofen was " completely irresponsible . "
" it 's practically bizarre to put him in close proximity again to the situation in which he committed a crime , " hilgers added .

the vatican has not got involved in the riekofen affair .
" it 's a german matter , " dpa news agency quoted a source within radio vatican as saying .
" the bishop will have to justify his behavior to his fellow bishops . " in 2002 , the german bishops acted to head off such a crisis , with the conference of bishops issuing guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . müller has denied breaching the guideline , saying he had a christian duty to forgive and had been convinced that the paedophile priest had reformed his ways . but hilgers and others worry the priesthood may inherently attract people susceptible to pederasty and say the church needs to be more proactive about preventing cases like the one in riekofen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 25.09.2007 merkel speaks of global need for action on climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not getting any cooler industrialized countries have a moral imperative to reduce co2 emissions , german chancellor angela merkel said monday , sept .
24 .
she spoke at an unprecedented one-day united nations climate conference in new york . germany 's chancellor repeated her call for global solutions to cutting co2 emissions , encouraging countries to begin looking for a way to move forward efforts to combat climate change .
negotiating a successor to the kyoto protocol - a treaty which sets targets for industrial nations to reduce carbon emissions - is of crucial importance , merkel said , speaking before a un climate conference .
" it 's not only the dry facts and numbers that call us to negotiate , but also the question of in what future we want to live , " she said .
" for me , this is not only an economic imperative , but also a moral one . "
merkel called for global co2 emissions , a major man-made factor that contributes to global warming , to be halved by 2050 .
carbon trading suggested as a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the un to take the lead on combating climate change merkel suggested that a global carbon-trading scheme , which places a price on industries ' carbon-dioxide emissions , should play a " central role " in plans to fight global warming .
" only when greenhouse gases have a price will climate friendly technologies really become economically attractive , " she said .
her comments were echoed by others , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in 2005 , the european union introduced the world 's largest carbon trading scheme .
the plan has not worked as expected , since some countries gave their polluters large numbers of carbon credits .
yet europe still feels carbon trading is the way forward .
" our ultimate success will depend on developing the carbon market , " barroso said at the un climate conference monday .
looking beyond the kyoto protocol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean fuel is a necessity the eu has agreed to reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , but both merkel and barroso said that figure could be raised to 30 percent if a binding international deal included other regions .
" industrialized countries must play a pioneering role here , " merkel said .
" they have to set themselves ambitious reduction targets .
they have to demonstrate how they intend to achieve these targets . "
french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major polluters to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2050 .
he advocated the use of nuclear energy , france 's main power source , as a possible solution .
" it is not a question of choice between growth and protecting our world , " sarkozy said .
" we need clean growth .
a new economy must be invented . "
un secretary general ban ki-moon said monday 's conference achieved its goal of building momentum ahead of a critical december meeting in bali , indonesia .
there , negotiators will begin talks to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" this event has sent a powerful signal to the world ... that there is a will and determination at the highest level to break with the past and act decisively , " ban said .
the us called on to take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man of action while california governor arnold schwarzenegger did address the conference , calling for " action , action , action , " on climate change , united states president george w. bush was conspicuously absent .
the us never ratified kyoto and has been reluctant to endorse ideas like carbon trading .
bush plans to hold his own conference on climate change in washington later this week .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said that new technologies were at the heart of us efforts to combat global warming .
" the world needs a technological revolution , " rice said monday , adding that the world must find ways to " transcend " fossil fuels in the search for clean , renewable alternatives .
monday 's address was the merkel 's first visit to the united nations as chancellor .
she was scheduled to address an annual gathering of the un general assembly tuesday afternoon , where she 's expected to again bring up the subject of climate change . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 25.09.2007 german anti-terror measures fight for life as opposition grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble has proposed many of the anti-terror measures under debate germany 's interior and defense ministries have been busy rolling out potential anti-terror measures over the past weeks .
but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "
biometrics up and running despite opposition in another move to increase security , germany will start adding fingerprints to its biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fingerprints will be added to the biometric passports opponents of the biometric system and a proposed biometric database accuse the federal and state governments of establishing the systems despite the public 's privacy and security concerns and with little open debate . meanwhile , supporters say biometric passports create an unrivaled level of security and protection against the counterfeit identification papers often used by terrorists and other criminals .
" many germans see the benefits of this increased security and accept the collection of data , " hofmann said .
" people have got used to this as part of life .
some , however , see this as part of the creation of a global surveillance structure where everybody 's whereabouts are known .
but whichever way you look at it , biometrics are a reality .
it 's a done deal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 .
she spoke at an unprecedented one-day united nations climate conference in new york . germany 's chancellor repeated her call for global solutions to cutting co2 emissions , encouraging countries to begin looking for a way to move forward efforts to combat climate change .
negotiating a successor to the kyoto protocol - a treaty which sets targets for industrial nations to reduce carbon emissions - is of crucial importance , merkel said , speaking before a un climate conference .
" it 's not only the dry facts and numbers that call us to negotiate , but also the question of in what future we want to live , " she said .
" for me , this is not only an economic imperative , but also a moral one . "
merkel called for global co2 emissions , a major man-made factor that contributes to global warming , to be halved by 2050 .
carbon trading suggested as a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the un to take the lead on combating climate change merkel suggested that a global carbon-trading scheme , which places a price on industries ' carbon-dioxide emissions , should play a " central role " in plans to fight global warming .
" only when greenhouse gases have a price will climate friendly technologies really become economically attractive , " she said .
her comments were echoed by others , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in 2005 , the european union introduced the world 's largest carbon trading scheme .
the plan has not worked as expected , since some countries gave their polluters large numbers of carbon credits .
yet europe still feels carbon trading is the way forward .
" our ultimate success will depend on developing the carbon market , " barroso said at the un climate conference monday .
looking beyond the kyoto protocol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean fuel is a necessity the eu has agreed to reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , but both merkel and barroso said that figure could be raised to 30 percent if a binding international deal included other regions .
" industrialized countries must play a pioneering role here , " merkel said .
" they have to set themselves ambitious reduction targets .
they have to demonstrate how they intend to achieve these targets . "
french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major polluters to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2050 .
he advocated the use of nuclear energy , france 's main power source , as a possible solution .
" it is not a question of choice between growth and protecting our world , " sarkozy said .
" we need clean growth .
a new economy must be invented . "
un secretary general ban ki-moon said monday 's conference achieved its goal of building momentum ahead of a critical december meeting in bali , indonesia .
there , negotiators will begin talks to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .

but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .
24 .
the transrapid will hover on a track above the ground and will travel at speeds up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour .
the 37-kilometer -lrb- 23-mile -rrb- route is scheduled to be completed by 2014 .
technology made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's " parting gift " the project is seen by critics as a " parting gift " for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
after 14 in power , stoiber will step down next month .
stoiber denied that the transrapid was being done as a personal favor , saying tuesday that the project was the " guiding light for high technology made in germany . "
german engineering giants siemens and thyssenkrupp developed the project .
so far , the technology has not been broadly adopted due to safety concerns .
in september 2006 , 23 people died and 11 were injured when a transrapid crashed into a maintenance vehicle during a test run near the western german city of osnabrück .
currently only china has an operational transrapid track .
it runs between shanghai and the city 's airport .
government warns of cost overruns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only operational transrapid is in shanghai as part of the deal , the german government will pay no more than 925 million euros for the magnetic levitation train and has stipulated it will not be responsible for cost overruns .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .
the city of munich is also unhappy about the tranrapid .
munich 's socialist mayor , christian ude , said he will fight in court against the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accident last year killed 23 people " naturally , the regional capital of munich will initiate legal measures against the plan 's official approval , " ude was quoted as saying by reuters news agency .
while this week 's financial agreement was an important step , cdu expert steffen kampeter said it does n't mean the project will get a green light in the end .
the recent agreement brought the project " nearer to being financially viable , " kampeter told the dpa news agency tuesday in berlin .
" the devil is in the details , " he said .
stoiber said he was confident the project would go forward despite ongoing opposition .
" nobody will reverse this step , " he said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when the countries joined the bloc in 2004 , the eu set aside 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to help the countries catch up with their wealthier counterparts .
the funds were meant to pay for new schools , roads and promote job training .
money not being used bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grybauskaite said countries are set to lose but the money needs to be spent by the end of 2007 , grybauskaite said .
with only three months left to go , the countries have used only 57 percent of their structural funds on average and just 22 percent of their cohesion funds , according to figures provided by grybauskaite at a news conference .
the countries were cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
it is unlikely that they will get a second shot at spending the money .
" do n't dream about an endless possibility to absorb these funds , " grybauskaite warned .
" absorption levels are not satisfactory and time is running out . "
eu : no excuse for unspent money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries do n't have much time left to spend their eu aid money poland had done the worst job of spending its allocated money .
grybauskaite said the responsibility to allocate the money efficiently and quickly rested completely with the national governments .
" do n't look for excuses , because there will be no excuses .
if poland is n't able -lsb- to spend the money -rsb- , then poland loses out , " grybauskaite , a lithuanian , said at the press conference .
in 2006 , europe 's 25 member states -lsb- bulgaria and romania joined in 2007 -rsb- spent 91 percent of the eu 's 106.6 billion euro budget , according to official figures .
france led the way in raking in eu dollars , landing 13.5 billion euros in 2006 , of which 10 billion was for agricultural funds .

after the hosts were eliminated by norway , germany will feel the full force of china 's support . germany 's women 's soccer team will have the support of the people 's republic as they take on the hosts ' victors norway in the first semi-final on wednesday , sept .
26 .
before people start accusing the chinese of rallying against their conquerors out of sour grapes , it must be pointed out that whenever china has n't been playing , the local fans have been cheering germany on in astounding numbers .
an expected 55,000 will be singing for the german team in tianjin , a similar number to those chinese who turned out to watch all of germany 's matches so far .
" there always seems to be more chinese support at our games than at any of the other games in which the chinese are n't playing , " said german goalkeeper nadine angerer .
" it 's pretty clear that german soccer is liked here very much . "
every self-respecting chinese fan knows about the careers of legends such as germany 's most-capped player lothar matthäus and " kaiser " franz beckenbauer but since the women 's team arrived to begin their title defense in china , the locals have found a new team of teutonic idols .
with 16 goals so far in this tournament , the high-scoring germans tick all the right boxes for chinese fans brought up on fast action and avalanches of goals .
" the chinese want to see attack after attack , " said german klaus schlappner who coached china 's men 's team from 1992 to 1995 .
china 's support hits heights against japan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's win over japan pleased the chinese fans while the chinese fans followed germany 's displays against argentina and england with appreciation , true fandom hit when the germans eliminated local rivals japan from the championship .
with rolling chants of " deguo , deguo " - " germany , germany " - the chinese added their voice to the german fans ' and celebrated just as wildly as their arch-rivals were sent packing .
the fanaticism is n't just restricted to the stadiums either .
everywhere the german squad goes , a legion of chinese fans follows .
easily spotted in their team leisurewear in shops and cafes , the german players are besieged for photographs and mementos .
" about 99 percent want the autograph of birgit prinz , " smiled defender ariane hingst .
germany 's star woman , a three-time world player of the year , is a megastar in soccer-crazy asia and the announcement of her name before matches causes a frenzy in the crowd .
" i had no idea that they knew me over here , " prinz said .
communism beats popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's fans favored north korea against germany despite the adoration , there are some things that do take precedence over popularity .
when germany were 3-0 up and cruising against north korea on saturday , chinese voices were leant in support to their beleaguered communist sisters .
no-one felt betrayed .
" if the spectators support us , it is great fun , " said german midfielder simone laudehr .
" if they shout for the others , then that 's only more motivation for us . "
the loyalty of the chinese fans to germany is unlikely to come into question on wednesday when norway , narrow 1-0 winners over the hosts , will feel the heat of the locals after what was seen to be a lucky quarter-final win .
the noise is expected to be only marginally less than if the chinese were meeting germany themselves for a place in the world cup final .
norway stands between holders and final germany will be looking to feed off whatever support they can get .
while they have only really struggled once in the tournament so far , laboring to a 0-0 draw with england , the norwegians are tough customers who are far from unknown to the world champions .
the germans and norwegians have faced off 28 times in the past , with 12 going germany 's way , 11 to norway and five draws .
" norway always belongs among the top nations , " said prinz .
" it will be the same here .
we can say from intense experience that we expect nothing less . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 25.09.2007 transrapid train hits the fast track in munich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's finance minister said he thinks funding could dry up before all the track is laid funding has been approved for a controversial high-speed train to run between munich and its airport .
but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .
24 .
the transrapid will hover on a track above the ground and will travel at speeds up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour .
the 37-kilometer -lrb- 23-mile -rrb- route is scheduled to be completed by 2014 .
technology made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's " parting gift " the project is seen by critics as a " parting gift " for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
after 14 in power , stoiber will step down next month .
stoiber denied that the transrapid was being done as a personal favor , saying tuesday that the project was the " guiding light for high technology made in germany . "
german engineering giants siemens and thyssenkrupp developed the project .
so far , the technology has not been broadly adopted due to safety concerns .
in september 2006 , 23 people died and 11 were injured when a transrapid crashed into a maintenance vehicle during a test run near the western german city of osnabrück .
currently only china has an operational transrapid track .
it runs between shanghai and the city 's airport .
government warns of cost overruns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only operational transrapid is in shanghai as part of the deal , the german government will pay no more than 925 million euros for the magnetic levitation train and has stipulated it will not be responsible for cost overruns .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .
the city of munich is also unhappy about the tranrapid .
munich 's socialist mayor , christian ude , said he will fight in court against the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accident last year killed 23 people " naturally , the regional capital of munich will initiate legal measures against the plan 's official approval , " ude was quoted as saying by reuters news agency .
while this week 's financial agreement was an important step , cdu expert steffen kampeter said it does n't mean the project will get a green light in the end .
the recent agreement brought the project " nearer to being financially viable , " kampeter told the dpa news agency tuesday in berlin .
" the devil is in the details , " he said .
stoiber said he was confident the project would go forward despite ongoing opposition .
" nobody will reverse this step , " he said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .
24 .
the transrapid will hover on a track above the ground and will travel at speeds up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour .
the 37-kilometer -lrb- 23-mile -rrb- route is scheduled to be completed by 2014 .
technology made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's " parting gift " the project is seen by critics as a " parting gift " for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
after 14 in power , stoiber will step down next month .
stoiber denied that the transrapid was being done as a personal favor , saying tuesday that the project was the " guiding light for high technology made in germany . "
german engineering giants siemens and thyssenkrupp developed the project .
so far , the technology has not been broadly adopted due to safety concerns .
in september 2006 , 23 people died and 11 were injured when a transrapid crashed into a maintenance vehicle during a test run near the western german city of osnabrück .
currently only china has an operational transrapid track .
it runs between shanghai and the city 's airport .
government warns of cost overruns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only operational transrapid is in shanghai as part of the deal , the german government will pay no more than 925 million euros for the magnetic levitation train and has stipulated it will not be responsible for cost overruns .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .
the city of munich is also unhappy about the tranrapid .
munich 's socialist mayor , christian ude , said he will fight in court against the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accident last year killed 23 people " naturally , the regional capital of munich will initiate legal measures against the plan 's official approval , " ude was quoted as saying by reuters news agency .
while this week 's financial agreement was an important step , cdu expert steffen kampeter said it does n't mean the project will get a green light in the end .
the recent agreement brought the project " nearer to being financially viable , " kampeter told the dpa news agency tuesday in berlin .
" the devil is in the details , " he said .
stoiber said he was confident the project would go forward despite ongoing opposition .
" nobody will reverse this step , " he said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 25.09.2007 german anti-terror measures fight for life as opposition grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble has proposed many of the anti-terror measures under debate germany 's interior and defense ministries have been busy rolling out potential anti-terror measures over the past weeks .
but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "
biometrics up and running despite opposition in another move to increase security , germany will start adding fingerprints to its biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fingerprints will be added to the biometric passports opponents of the biometric system and a proposed biometric database accuse the federal and state governments of establishing the systems despite the public 's privacy and security concerns and with little open debate . meanwhile , supporters say biometric passports create an unrivaled level of security and protection against the counterfeit identification papers often used by terrorists and other criminals .
" many germans see the benefits of this increased security and accept the collection of data , " hofmann said .
" people have got used to this as part of life .
some , however , see this as part of the creation of a global surveillance structure where everybody 's whereabouts are known .
but whichever way you look at it , biometrics are a reality .
it 's a done deal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when the countries joined the bloc in 2004 , the eu set aside 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to help the countries catch up with their wealthier counterparts .
the funds were meant to pay for new schools , roads and promote job training .
money not being used bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grybauskaite said countries are set to lose but the money needs to be spent by the end of 2007 , grybauskaite said .
with only three months left to go , the countries have used only 57 percent of their structural funds on average and just 22 percent of their cohesion funds , according to figures provided by grybauskaite at a news conference .
the countries were cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
it is unlikely that they will get a second shot at spending the money .
" do n't dream about an endless possibility to absorb these funds , " grybauskaite warned .
" absorption levels are not satisfactory and time is running out . "
eu : no excuse for unspent money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries do n't have much time left to spend their eu aid money poland had done the worst job of spending its allocated money .
grybauskaite said the responsibility to allocate the money efficiently and quickly rested completely with the national governments .
" do n't look for excuses , because there will be no excuses .
if poland is n't able -lsb- to spend the money -rsb- , then poland loses out , " grybauskaite , a lithuanian , said at the press conference .
in 2006 , europe 's 25 member states -lsb- bulgaria and romania joined in 2007 -rsb- spent 91 percent of the eu 's 106.6 billion euro budget , according to official figures .
france led the way in raking in eu dollars , landing 13.5 billion euros in 2006 , of which 10 billion was for agricultural funds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 25.09.2007 diplomacy needed after dalai lama visit in germany , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sino-german relations are shaky after chancellor merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama china has again criticized german chancellor for her meeting with the dalai lama over the weekend .
on tuesday , china said it had damaged ties between the two countries and called on berlin to remedy the situation . dw-world.de spoke with china expert eberhard sandschneider of the german council on foreign relations in berlin about how sino-german relations could develop after the controversial meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama - tibet 's spiritual leader - at the chancellery on sunday , sept .
23 . dw-world.de : china cancelled two meetings with germany - one was a justice conference in munich , another was a traditional breakfast meeting between china 's and germany 's foreign ministers on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york .
now china is saying the foreign ministers should meet after all .
what 's all the somersaulting about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china expert eberhard sandschneider eberhard sandschneider : obviously , the meeting between chancellor merkel and the dalai lama has angered china and will do so for some time .
but , it 's certainly not in germany 's interest , nor in china 's , to see a downturn in bilateral relations .
china wants to make clear on a diplomatic level that the dalai lama meeting was not acceptable , but german diplomats have also tried to show to their chinese counterparts that this should not be the end of the dialogue and that we should get back to business as usual .
after all , this meeting -lsb- between merkel and the dalai lama -rsb- is not a core issue of german-chinese relations and should not be treated as such . was merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama a mistake ? the meeting was perfectly okay , but the place makes a difference .
it 's the first time the german chancellor has received the dalai lama at the chancellery itself , and that gives political clout to someone who certainly is n't a friend of the chinese government . it makes this visit , even though it 's been declared private , very political . it was a mistake in that it does not help german-chinese relations .
let me give you one example .
we are all watching what is going on in burma right now .
it would be absolutely helpful and necessary for german foreign minister steinmeier to pick up the phone and call his chinese counterpart to express interest in finding a solution in burma ; for the time being , that is not possible . what are other examples of where good sino-german relations are important ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was on friendly terms with chinese premier wen jiabao -lrb- r -rrb- during an august visit in beijing basically , all major aspects of international relations .
we know that it is not possible to solve any of these problems without china - be it climate change , iran , energy supply or north korea .
if one assumes that it is in our interest to have china cooperate , then it would make sense not to prevent cooperative behavior on the part of beijing .
it 's partly economic influence , but it 's far more .
china is an important strategic partner for all the major issues on the international agenda , and also from a german perspective . still , is n't china actually interfering in germany 's affairs when it dictates with whom the chancellor should or should not meet ? theoretically , yes , it 's germany 's business , and i 'm not saying she should n't have met the dalai lama at all , but that is the game of playing interest against interest .
it is in the interest of our chancellor or even of the german government to be in dialogue with the dalai lama .
on the other hand , china has other interests , and whenever you have clashes of this kind , then a little more diplomacy is needed not to irritate bilateral relations .
it is not about dictating to each other what they should do , but about respecting each other , and only if you respect these differences can you work together in a more or less coordinated way . what are china 's interests in having good relations with germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke with students of the german-chinese law institute in nanjing in august we are one of its main trading partners - certainly the most important european trading partner .
china is interested in german technology and doing business with germany .
but , it also knows that whenever it comes to international coordination , europe is important and germany is important within europe , so there is a mutual interest in getting these things in order as soon as possible . you mentioned burma , what could china be doing to help ease the tensions there ? china is the only international actor who has some kind of pull with the junta in burma .
no other countries do .
china 's interests are clear : it cooperates both economically and militarily with burma .
so , it is in china 's interests to maintain stability there .
the chinese government certainly does not care whether it is a military leadership in burma or not , just as it does n't care about military regimes in africa .
but stability in the region is critical to china , and chinese representatives have made clear that they want the burmese military leaders to talk with the demonstrators and not shoot at them .
it remains to be seen whether or not china will take action . interview : louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on tuesday , china said it had damaged ties between the two countries and called on berlin to remedy the situation . dw-world.de spoke with china expert eberhard sandschneider of the german council on foreign relations in berlin about how sino-german relations could develop after the controversial meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama - tibet 's spiritual leader - at the chancellery on sunday , sept .
23 . dw-world.de : china cancelled two meetings with germany - one was a justice conference in munich , another was a traditional breakfast meeting between china 's and germany 's foreign ministers on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york .
now china is saying the foreign ministers should meet after all .
what 's all the somersaulting about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china expert eberhard sandschneider eberhard sandschneider : obviously , the meeting between chancellor merkel and the dalai lama has angered china and will do so for some time .
but , it 's certainly not in germany 's interest , nor in china 's , to see a downturn in bilateral relations .
china wants to make clear on a diplomatic level that the dalai lama meeting was not acceptable , but german diplomats have also tried to show to their chinese counterparts that this should not be the end of the dialogue and that we should get back to business as usual .
after all , this meeting -lsb- between merkel and the dalai lama -rsb- is not a core issue of german-chinese relations and should not be treated as such . was merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama a mistake ? the meeting was perfectly okay , but the place makes a difference .
it 's the first time the german chancellor has received the dalai lama at the chancellery itself , and that gives political clout to someone who certainly is n't a friend of the chinese government . it makes this visit , even though it 's been declared private , very political . it was a mistake in that it does not help german-chinese relations .
let me give you one example .
we are all watching what is going on in burma right now .
it would be absolutely helpful and necessary for german foreign minister steinmeier to pick up the phone and call his chinese counterpart to express interest in finding a solution in burma ; for the time being , that is not possible . what are other examples of where good sino-german relations are important ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was on friendly terms with chinese premier wen jiabao -lrb- r -rrb- during an august visit in beijing basically , all major aspects of international relations .
we know that it is not possible to solve any of these problems without china - be it climate change , iran , energy supply or north korea .
if one assumes that it is in our interest to have china cooperate , then it would make sense not to prevent cooperative behavior on the part of beijing .
it 's partly economic influence , but it 's far more .
china is an important strategic partner for all the major issues on the international agenda , and also from a german perspective . still , is n't china actually interfering in germany 's affairs when it dictates with whom the chancellor should or should not meet ? theoretically , yes , it 's germany 's business , and i 'm not saying she should n't have met the dalai lama at all , but that is the game of playing interest against interest .
it is in the interest of our chancellor or even of the german government to be in dialogue with the dalai lama .
on the other hand , china has other interests , and whenever you have clashes of this kind , then a little more diplomacy is needed not to irritate bilateral relations .
it is not about dictating to each other what they should do , but about respecting each other , and only if you respect these differences can you work together in a more or less coordinated way . what are china 's interests in having good relations with germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke with students of the german-chinese law institute in nanjing in august we are one of its main trading partners - certainly the most important european trading partner .
china is interested in german technology and doing business with germany .
but , it also knows that whenever it comes to international coordination , europe is important and germany is important within europe , so there is a mutual interest in getting these things in order as soon as possible . you mentioned burma , what could china be doing to help ease the tensions there ? china is the only international actor who has some kind of pull with the junta in burma .
no other countries do .
china 's interests are clear : it cooperates both economically and militarily with burma .
so , it is in china 's interests to maintain stability there .
the chinese government certainly does not care whether it is a military leadership in burma or not , just as it does n't care about military regimes in africa .
but stability in the region is critical to china , and chinese representatives have made clear that they want the burmese military leaders to talk with the demonstrators and not shoot at them .

the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .

he also called for more openness on this sensitive issue . the bishop of fulda , heinz josef algermissen , said his colleague bishop gerhard ludwig müller of regensburg made a mistake in offering a second chance to a priest with a history of pedophilia .
" if something has happened in the past with children , a new start should only be allowed at a distance from children , " algermissen told the bayern2 radio station .
the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .
müller reassigned the priest to the parish of riekofen , a village near regensburg , after that sentence expired .

" there 's nothing worse for a bishop than a man of the cloth abusing people 's trust , " algermissen said .
" something like this is a true blow , and in view of what happened , you can feel half-sick . "
müller has justified his decision to reassign peter k. by saying he was guided by psychological evaluations showing that the priest did not have a pedophile fixation .
müller denies responsibility for any grotesque lapses in judgment .
" even a bishop ca n't rule out the possibility of a priest misusing the freedom -lsb- of his position -rsb- , " müller said in an interview with the catholic news agency kna .
" priests are not marionettes .

in a press conference , the head of a german initiative representing victims of abuse by priests , johannes heibel , said müller 's decision to reassign peter k. was " more than scandalous . "
german psychoanalyst micha hilgers concurred , telling the dpa news agency that assigning peter k. to riekofen was " completely irresponsible . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 25.09.2007 german anti-terror measures fight for life as opposition grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble has proposed many of the anti-terror measures under debate germany 's interior and defense ministries have been busy rolling out potential anti-terror measures over the past weeks .
but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "
biometrics up and running despite opposition in another move to increase security , germany will start adding fingerprints to its biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fingerprints will be added to the biometric passports opponents of the biometric system and a proposed biometric database accuse the federal and state governments of establishing the systems despite the public 's privacy and security concerns and with little open debate . meanwhile , supporters say biometric passports create an unrivaled level of security and protection against the counterfeit identification papers often used by terrorists and other criminals .
" many germans see the benefits of this increased security and accept the collection of data , " hofmann said .
" people have got used to this as part of life .
some , however , see this as part of the creation of a global surveillance structure where everybody 's whereabouts are known .
but whichever way you look at it , biometrics are a reality .
it 's a done deal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 25.09.2007 german anti-terror measures fight for life as opposition grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble has proposed many of the anti-terror measures under debate germany 's interior and defense ministries have been busy rolling out potential anti-terror measures over the past weeks .
but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "

24 .
she spoke at an unprecedented one-day united nations climate conference in new york . germany 's chancellor repeated her call for global solutions to cutting co2 emissions , encouraging countries to begin looking for a way to move forward efforts to combat climate change .
negotiating a successor to the kyoto protocol - a treaty which sets targets for industrial nations to reduce carbon emissions - is of crucial importance , merkel said , speaking before a un climate conference .
" it 's not only the dry facts and numbers that call us to negotiate , but also the question of in what future we want to live , " she said .
" for me , this is not only an economic imperative , but also a moral one . "
merkel called for global co2 emissions , a major man-made factor that contributes to global warming , to be halved by 2050 .
carbon trading suggested as a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the un to take the lead on combating climate change merkel suggested that a global carbon-trading scheme , which places a price on industries ' carbon-dioxide emissions , should play a " central role " in plans to fight global warming .
" only when greenhouse gases have a price will climate friendly technologies really become economically attractive , " she said .
her comments were echoed by others , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in 2005 , the european union introduced the world 's largest carbon trading scheme .
the plan has not worked as expected , since some countries gave their polluters large numbers of carbon credits .
yet europe still feels carbon trading is the way forward .
" our ultimate success will depend on developing the carbon market , " barroso said at the un climate conference monday .
looking beyond the kyoto protocol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean fuel is a necessity the eu has agreed to reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , but both merkel and barroso said that figure could be raised to 30 percent if a binding international deal included other regions .
" industrialized countries must play a pioneering role here , " merkel said .
" they have to set themselves ambitious reduction targets .
they have to demonstrate how they intend to achieve these targets . "
french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major polluters to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2050 .
he advocated the use of nuclear energy , france 's main power source , as a possible solution .
" it is not a question of choice between growth and protecting our world , " sarkozy said .
" we need clean growth .
a new economy must be invented . "
un secretary general ban ki-moon said monday 's conference achieved its goal of building momentum ahead of a critical december meeting in bali , indonesia .
there , negotiators will begin talks to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" this event has sent a powerful signal to the world ... that there is a will and determination at the highest level to break with the past and act decisively , " ban said .

24 .
she spoke at an unprecedented one-day united nations climate conference in new york . germany 's chancellor repeated her call for global solutions to cutting co2 emissions , encouraging countries to begin looking for a way to move forward efforts to combat climate change .
negotiating a successor to the kyoto protocol - a treaty which sets targets for industrial nations to reduce carbon emissions - is of crucial importance , merkel said , speaking before a un climate conference .
" it 's not only the dry facts and numbers that call us to negotiate , but also the question of in what future we want to live , " she said .
" for me , this is not only an economic imperative , but also a moral one . "
merkel called for global co2 emissions , a major man-made factor that contributes to global warming , to be halved by 2050 .
carbon trading suggested as a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the un to take the lead on combating climate change merkel suggested that a global carbon-trading scheme , which places a price on industries ' carbon-dioxide emissions , should play a " central role " in plans to fight global warming .
" only when greenhouse gases have a price will climate friendly technologies really become economically attractive , " she said .

when the countries joined the bloc in 2004 , the eu set aside 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to help the countries catch up with their wealthier counterparts .
the funds were meant to pay for new schools , roads and promote job training .
money not being used bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grybauskaite said countries are set to lose but the money needs to be spent by the end of 2007 , grybauskaite said .
with only three months left to go , the countries have used only 57 percent of their structural funds on average and just 22 percent of their cohesion funds , according to figures provided by grybauskaite at a news conference .
the countries were cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
it is unlikely that they will get a second shot at spending the money .
" do n't dream about an endless possibility to absorb these funds , " grybauskaite warned .

eu : no excuse for unspent money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries do n't have much time left to spend their eu aid money poland had done the worst job of spending its allocated money .
grybauskaite said the responsibility to allocate the money efficiently and quickly rested completely with the national governments .
" do n't look for excuses , because there will be no excuses .
if poland is n't able -lsb- to spend the money -rsb- , then poland loses out , " grybauskaite , a lithuanian , said at the press conference .
in 2006 , europe 's 25 member states -lsb- bulgaria and romania joined in 2007 -rsb- spent 91 percent of the eu 's 106.6 billion euro budget , according to official figures .
france led the way in raking in eu dollars , landing 13.5 billion euros in 2006 , of which 10 billion was for agricultural funds .
greece , lithuania and malta are the biggest beneficiaries after luxembourg , when viewed in terms of eu funds as a percentage of gross national income . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 25.09.2007 german anti-terror measures fight for life as opposition grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble has proposed many of the anti-terror measures under debate germany 's interior and defense ministries have been busy rolling out potential anti-terror measures over the past weeks .
but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "
biometrics up and running despite opposition in another move to increase security , germany will start adding fingerprints to its biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fingerprints will be added to the biometric passports opponents of the biometric system and a proposed biometric database accuse the federal and state governments of establishing the systems despite the public 's privacy and security concerns and with little open debate . meanwhile , supporters say biometric passports create an unrivaled level of security and protection against the counterfeit identification papers often used by terrorists and other criminals .
" many germans see the benefits of this increased security and accept the collection of data , " hofmann said .
" people have got used to this as part of life .
some , however , see this as part of the creation of a global surveillance structure where everybody 's whereabouts are known .
but whichever way you look at it , biometrics are a reality .
it 's a done deal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also called for more openness on this sensitive issue . the bishop of fulda , heinz josef algermissen , said his colleague bishop gerhard ludwig müller of regensburg made a mistake in offering a second chance to a priest with a history of pedophilia .
" if something has happened in the past with children , a new start should only be allowed at a distance from children , " algermissen told the bayern2 radio station .
the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .
müller reassigned the priest to the parish of riekofen , a village near regensburg , after that sentence expired .
police then arrested 39-year-old peter k. on aug .
30 for suspected sexual offences committed between 2003 and 2006 , and riekofen was given a new priest .
" nothing worse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop algermissen has been critical of what happened algermissen 's criticism of his colleague was all the more noteworthy because it came on the eve of the ongoing conference of german bishops in fulda .
algermissen called for an open discussion of the riekofen affair .
" there 's nothing worse for a bishop than a man of the cloth abusing people 's trust , " algermissen said .
" something like this is a true blow , and in view of what happened , you can feel half-sick . "
müller has justified his decision to reassign peter k. by saying he was guided by psychological evaluations showing that the priest did not have a pedophile fixation .
müller denies responsibility for any grotesque lapses in judgment .
" even a bishop ca n't rule out the possibility of a priest misusing the freedom -lsb- of his position -rsb- , " müller said in an interview with the catholic news agency kna .
" priests are not marionettes .
they themselves are responsible for what they do with parishioners . " calls for bishop 's resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is not getting involved at the moment but others remain outraged and were calling for müller to step down .
in a press conference , the head of a german initiative representing victims of abuse by priests , johannes heibel , said müller 's decision to reassign peter k. was " more than scandalous . "
german psychoanalyst micha hilgers concurred , telling the dpa news agency that assigning peter k. to riekofen was " completely irresponsible . "
" it 's practically bizarre to put him in close proximity again to the situation in which he committed a crime , " hilgers added .
" therapy is possible , but a cure is not . "
recurring problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop müller said priests are responsible for their own behavior long a topic shrouded by secrecy , cases of pederasty among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not got involved in the riekofen affair .
" it 's a german matter , " dpa news agency quoted a source within radio vatican as saying .
" the bishop will have to justify his behavior to his fellow bishops . " in 2002 , the german bishops acted to head off such a crisis , with the conference of bishops issuing guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . müller has denied breaching the guideline , saying he had a christian duty to forgive and had been convinced that the paedophile priest had reformed his ways . but hilgers and others worry the priesthood may inherently attract people susceptible to pederasty and say the church needs to be more proactive about preventing cases like the one in riekofen .
" the bishop and the bishopric have a duty to keep an especially keen eye out for things like this , " hilgers told dpa .
" they should be conscious of the special risk .
that has been criminally neglected . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the hosts were eliminated by norway , germany will feel the full force of china 's support . germany 's women 's soccer team will have the support of the people 's republic as they take on the hosts ' victors norway in the first semi-final on wednesday , sept .
26 .
before people start accusing the chinese of rallying against their conquerors out of sour grapes , it must be pointed out that whenever china has n't been playing , the local fans have been cheering germany on in astounding numbers .
an expected 55,000 will be singing for the german team in tianjin , a similar number to those chinese who turned out to watch all of germany 's matches so far .
" there always seems to be more chinese support at our games than at any of the other games in which the chinese are n't playing , " said german goalkeeper nadine angerer .
" it 's pretty clear that german soccer is liked here very much . "
every self-respecting chinese fan knows about the careers of legends such as germany 's most-capped player lothar matthäus and " kaiser " franz beckenbauer but since the women 's team arrived to begin their title defense in china , the locals have found a new team of teutonic idols .
with 16 goals so far in this tournament , the high-scoring germans tick all the right boxes for chinese fans brought up on fast action and avalanches of goals .
" the chinese want to see attack after attack , " said german klaus schlappner who coached china 's men 's team from 1992 to 1995 .
china 's support hits heights against japan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's win over japan pleased the chinese fans while the chinese fans followed germany 's displays against argentina and england with appreciation , true fandom hit when the germans eliminated local rivals japan from the championship .
with rolling chants of " deguo , deguo " - " germany , germany " - the chinese added their voice to the german fans ' and celebrated just as wildly as their arch-rivals were sent packing .
the fanaticism is n't just restricted to the stadiums either .
everywhere the german squad goes , a legion of chinese fans follows .
easily spotted in their team leisurewear in shops and cafes , the german players are besieged for photographs and mementos .
" about 99 percent want the autograph of birgit prinz , " smiled defender ariane hingst .
germany 's star woman , a three-time world player of the year , is a megastar in soccer-crazy asia and the announcement of her name before matches causes a frenzy in the crowd .
" i had no idea that they knew me over here , " prinz said .
communism beats popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's fans favored north korea against germany despite the adoration , there are some things that do take precedence over popularity .
when germany were 3-0 up and cruising against north korea on saturday , chinese voices were leant in support to their beleaguered communist sisters .
no-one felt betrayed .
" if the spectators support us , it is great fun , " said german midfielder simone laudehr .
" if they shout for the others , then that 's only more motivation for us . "
the loyalty of the chinese fans to germany is unlikely to come into question on wednesday when norway , narrow 1-0 winners over the hosts , will feel the heat of the locals after what was seen to be a lucky quarter-final win .
the noise is expected to be only marginally less than if the chinese were meeting germany themselves for a place in the world cup final .
norway stands between holders and final germany will be looking to feed off whatever support they can get .
while they have only really struggled once in the tournament so far , laboring to a 0-0 draw with england , the norwegians are tough customers who are far from unknown to the world champions .
the germans and norwegians have faced off 28 times in the past , with 12 going germany 's way , 11 to norway and five draws .
" norway always belongs among the top nations , " said prinz .
" it will be the same here .
we can say from intense experience that we expect nothing less . "

but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .

the transrapid will hover on a track above the ground and will travel at speeds up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour .

after 14 in power , stoiber will step down next month .
stoiber denied that the transrapid was being done as a personal favor , saying tuesday that the project was the " guiding light for high technology made in germany . "
german engineering giants siemens and thyssenkrupp developed the project .
so far , the technology has not been broadly adopted due to safety concerns .
in september 2006 , 23 people died and 11 were injured when a transrapid crashed into a maintenance vehicle during a test run near the western german city of osnabrück .

germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .
the city of munich is also unhappy about the tranrapid .

the recent agreement brought the project " nearer to being financially viable , " kampeter told the dpa news agency tuesday in berlin .

on tuesday , china said it had damaged ties between the two countries and called on berlin to remedy the situation . dw-world.de spoke with china expert eberhard sandschneider of the german council on foreign relations in berlin about how sino-german relations could develop after the controversial meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama - tibet 's spiritual leader - at the chancellery on sunday , sept .
23 . dw-world.de : china cancelled two meetings with germany - one was a justice conference in munich , another was a traditional breakfast meeting between china 's and germany 's foreign ministers on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york .
now china is saying the foreign ministers should meet after all .

china wants to make clear on a diplomatic level that the dalai lama meeting was not acceptable , but german diplomats have also tried to show to their chinese counterparts that this should not be the end of the dialogue and that we should get back to business as usual .
after all , this meeting -lsb- between merkel and the dalai lama -rsb- is not a core issue of german-chinese relations and should not be treated as such . was merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama a mistake ? the meeting was perfectly okay , but the place makes a difference .

it is in the interest of our chancellor or even of the german government to be in dialogue with the dalai lama .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 25.09.2007 german anti-terror measures fight for life as opposition grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble has proposed many of the anti-terror measures under debate germany 's interior and defense ministries have been busy rolling out potential anti-terror measures over the past weeks .
but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "
biometrics up and running despite opposition in another move to increase security , germany will start adding fingerprints to its biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fingerprints will be added to the biometric passports opponents of the biometric system and a proposed biometric database accuse the federal and state governments of establishing the systems despite the public 's privacy and security concerns and with little open debate . meanwhile , supporters say biometric passports create an unrivaled level of security and protection against the counterfeit identification papers often used by terrorists and other criminals .
" many germans see the benefits of this increased security and accept the collection of data , " hofmann said .
" people have got used to this as part of life .
some , however , see this as part of the creation of a global surveillance structure where everybody 's whereabouts are known .
but whichever way you look at it , biometrics are a reality .
it 's a done deal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .

some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .

deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .

but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 25.09.2007 diplomacy needed after dalai lama visit in germany , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sino-german relations are shaky after chancellor merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama china has again criticized german chancellor for her meeting with the dalai lama over the weekend .
on tuesday , china said it had damaged ties between the two countries and called on berlin to remedy the situation . dw-world.de spoke with china expert eberhard sandschneider of the german council on foreign relations in berlin about how sino-german relations could develop after the controversial meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama - tibet 's spiritual leader - at the chancellery on sunday , sept .
23 . dw-world.de : china cancelled two meetings with germany - one was a justice conference in munich , another was a traditional breakfast meeting between china 's and germany 's foreign ministers on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york .
now china is saying the foreign ministers should meet after all .
what 's all the somersaulting about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china expert eberhard sandschneider eberhard sandschneider : obviously , the meeting between chancellor merkel and the dalai lama has angered china and will do so for some time .
but , it 's certainly not in germany 's interest , nor in china 's , to see a downturn in bilateral relations .
china wants to make clear on a diplomatic level that the dalai lama meeting was not acceptable , but german diplomats have also tried to show to their chinese counterparts that this should not be the end of the dialogue and that we should get back to business as usual .
after all , this meeting -lsb- between merkel and the dalai lama -rsb- is not a core issue of german-chinese relations and should not be treated as such . was merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama a mistake ? the meeting was perfectly okay , but the place makes a difference .
it 's the first time the german chancellor has received the dalai lama at the chancellery itself , and that gives political clout to someone who certainly is n't a friend of the chinese government . it makes this visit , even though it 's been declared private , very political . it was a mistake in that it does not help german-chinese relations .
let me give you one example .
we are all watching what is going on in burma right now .
it would be absolutely helpful and necessary for german foreign minister steinmeier to pick up the phone and call his chinese counterpart to express interest in finding a solution in burma ; for the time being , that is not possible . what are other examples of where good sino-german relations are important ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was on friendly terms with chinese premier wen jiabao -lrb- r -rrb- during an august visit in beijing basically , all major aspects of international relations .
we know that it is not possible to solve any of these problems without china - be it climate change , iran , energy supply or north korea .
if one assumes that it is in our interest to have china cooperate , then it would make sense not to prevent cooperative behavior on the part of beijing .
it 's partly economic influence , but it 's far more .
china is an important strategic partner for all the major issues on the international agenda , and also from a german perspective . still , is n't china actually interfering in germany 's affairs when it dictates with whom the chancellor should or should not meet ? theoretically , yes , it 's germany 's business , and i 'm not saying she should n't have met the dalai lama at all , but that is the game of playing interest against interest .
it is in the interest of our chancellor or even of the german government to be in dialogue with the dalai lama .
on the other hand , china has other interests , and whenever you have clashes of this kind , then a little more diplomacy is needed not to irritate bilateral relations .
it is not about dictating to each other what they should do , but about respecting each other , and only if you respect these differences can you work together in a more or less coordinated way . what are china 's interests in having good relations with germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke with students of the german-chinese law institute in nanjing in august we are one of its main trading partners - certainly the most important european trading partner .
china is interested in german technology and doing business with germany .
but , it also knows that whenever it comes to international coordination , europe is important and germany is important within europe , so there is a mutual interest in getting these things in order as soon as possible . you mentioned burma , what could china be doing to help ease the tensions there ? china is the only international actor who has some kind of pull with the junta in burma .
no other countries do .
china 's interests are clear : it cooperates both economically and militarily with burma .
so , it is in china 's interests to maintain stability there .
the chinese government certainly does not care whether it is a military leadership in burma or not , just as it does n't care about military regimes in africa .
but stability in the region is critical to china , and chinese representatives have made clear that they want the burmese military leaders to talk with the demonstrators and not shoot at them .
it remains to be seen whether or not china will take action . interview : louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .
24 .
the transrapid will hover on a track above the ground and will travel at speeds up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour .
the 37-kilometer -lrb- 23-mile -rrb- route is scheduled to be completed by 2014 .
technology made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's " parting gift " the project is seen by critics as a " parting gift " for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
after 14 in power , stoiber will step down next month .
stoiber denied that the transrapid was being done as a personal favor , saying tuesday that the project was the " guiding light for high technology made in germany . "
german engineering giants siemens and thyssenkrupp developed the project .
so far , the technology has not been broadly adopted due to safety concerns .
in september 2006 , 23 people died and 11 were injured when a transrapid crashed into a maintenance vehicle during a test run near the western german city of osnabrück .
currently only china has an operational transrapid track .
it runs between shanghai and the city 's airport .
government warns of cost overruns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only operational transrapid is in shanghai as part of the deal , the german government will pay no more than 925 million euros for the magnetic levitation train and has stipulated it will not be responsible for cost overruns .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .

but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .
24 .
the transrapid will hover on a track above the ground and will travel at speeds up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour .
the 37-kilometer -lrb- 23-mile -rrb- route is scheduled to be completed by 2014 .
technology made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's " parting gift " the project is seen by critics as a " parting gift " for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
after 14 in power , stoiber will step down next month .
stoiber denied that the transrapid was being done as a personal favor , saying tuesday that the project was the " guiding light for high technology made in germany . "
german engineering giants siemens and thyssenkrupp developed the project .
so far , the technology has not been broadly adopted due to safety concerns .
in september 2006 , 23 people died and 11 were injured when a transrapid crashed into a maintenance vehicle during a test run near the western german city of osnabrück .
currently only china has an operational transrapid track .
it runs between shanghai and the city 's airport .
government warns of cost overruns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only operational transrapid is in shanghai as part of the deal , the german government will pay no more than 925 million euros for the magnetic levitation train and has stipulated it will not be responsible for cost overruns .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .
the city of munich is also unhappy about the tranrapid .
munich 's socialist mayor , christian ude , said he will fight in court against the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accident last year killed 23 people " naturally , the regional capital of munich will initiate legal measures against the plan 's official approval , " ude was quoted as saying by reuters news agency .

24 .
she spoke at an unprecedented one-day united nations climate conference in new york . germany 's chancellor repeated her call for global solutions to cutting co2 emissions , encouraging countries to begin looking for a way to move forward efforts to combat climate change .
negotiating a successor to the kyoto protocol - a treaty which sets targets for industrial nations to reduce carbon emissions - is of crucial importance , merkel said , speaking before a un climate conference .
" it 's not only the dry facts and numbers that call us to negotiate , but also the question of in what future we want to live , " she said .
" for me , this is not only an economic imperative , but also a moral one . "
merkel called for global co2 emissions , a major man-made factor that contributes to global warming , to be halved by 2050 .
carbon trading suggested as a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the un to take the lead on combating climate change merkel suggested that a global carbon-trading scheme , which places a price on industries ' carbon-dioxide emissions , should play a " central role " in plans to fight global warming .
" only when greenhouse gases have a price will climate friendly technologies really become economically attractive , " she said .
her comments were echoed by others , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in 2005 , the european union introduced the world 's largest carbon trading scheme .
the plan has not worked as expected , since some countries gave their polluters large numbers of carbon credits .
yet europe still feels carbon trading is the way forward .
" our ultimate success will depend on developing the carbon market , " barroso said at the un climate conference monday .
looking beyond the kyoto protocol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean fuel is a necessity the eu has agreed to reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , but both merkel and barroso said that figure could be raised to 30 percent if a binding international deal included other regions .
" industrialized countries must play a pioneering role here , " merkel said .
" they have to set themselves ambitious reduction targets .
they have to demonstrate how they intend to achieve these targets . "
french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major polluters to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2050 .
he advocated the use of nuclear energy , france 's main power source , as a possible solution .
" it is not a question of choice between growth and protecting our world , " sarkozy said .
" we need clean growth .
a new economy must be invented . "
un secretary general ban ki-moon said monday 's conference achieved its goal of building momentum ahead of a critical december meeting in bali , indonesia .
there , negotiators will begin talks to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" this event has sent a powerful signal to the world ... that there is a will and determination at the highest level to break with the past and act decisively , " ban said .

bush plans to hold his own conference on climate change in washington later this week .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said that new technologies were at the heart of us efforts to combat global warming .

but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .
24 .
the transrapid will hover on a track above the ground and will travel at speeds up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour .
the 37-kilometer -lrb- 23-mile -rrb- route is scheduled to be completed by 2014 .
technology made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's " parting gift " the project is seen by critics as a " parting gift " for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
after 14 in power , stoiber will step down next month .
stoiber denied that the transrapid was being done as a personal favor , saying tuesday that the project was the " guiding light for high technology made in germany . "
german engineering giants siemens and thyssenkrupp developed the project .
so far , the technology has not been broadly adopted due to safety concerns .
in september 2006 , 23 people died and 11 were injured when a transrapid crashed into a maintenance vehicle during a test run near the western german city of osnabrück .
currently only china has an operational transrapid track .
it runs between shanghai and the city 's airport .
government warns of cost overruns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only operational transrapid is in shanghai as part of the deal , the german government will pay no more than 925 million euros for the magnetic levitation train and has stipulated it will not be responsible for cost overruns .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .
the city of munich is also unhappy about the tranrapid .
munich 's socialist mayor , christian ude , said he will fight in court against the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accident last year killed 23 people " naturally , the regional capital of munich will initiate legal measures against the plan 's official approval , " ude was quoted as saying by reuters news agency .
while this week 's financial agreement was an important step , cdu expert steffen kampeter said it does n't mean the project will get a green light in the end .
the recent agreement brought the project " nearer to being financially viable , " kampeter told the dpa news agency tuesday in berlin .
" the devil is in the details , " he said .
stoiber said he was confident the project would go forward despite ongoing opposition .
" nobody will reverse this step , " he said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 25.09.2007 german bishop criticizes reassignment of pedophilic priest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the priest was assigned to this parish church after being convicted of pedophiliac crimes the host of a bishops ' conference in southern germany has taken one of his peers to task for reassigning a priest with a history of sexual abuse to a new parish .
he also called for more openness on this sensitive issue . the bishop of fulda , heinz josef algermissen , said his colleague bishop gerhard ludwig müller of regensburg made a mistake in offering a second chance to a priest with a history of pedophilia .
" if something has happened in the past with children , a new start should only be allowed at a distance from children , " algermissen told the bayern2 radio station .
the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .
müller reassigned the priest to the parish of riekofen , a village near regensburg , after that sentence expired .
police then arrested 39-year-old peter k. on aug .
30 for suspected sexual offences committed between 2003 and 2006 , and riekofen was given a new priest .
" nothing worse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop algermissen has been critical of what happened algermissen 's criticism of his colleague was all the more noteworthy because it came on the eve of the ongoing conference of german bishops in fulda .
algermissen called for an open discussion of the riekofen affair .
" there 's nothing worse for a bishop than a man of the cloth abusing people 's trust , " algermissen said .
" something like this is a true blow , and in view of what happened , you can feel half-sick . "
müller has justified his decision to reassign peter k. by saying he was guided by psychological evaluations showing that the priest did not have a pedophile fixation .
müller denies responsibility for any grotesque lapses in judgment .
" even a bishop ca n't rule out the possibility of a priest misusing the freedom -lsb- of his position -rsb- , " müller said in an interview with the catholic news agency kna .
" priests are not marionettes .
they themselves are responsible for what they do with parishioners . " calls for bishop 's resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is not getting involved at the moment but others remain outraged and were calling for müller to step down .
in a press conference , the head of a german initiative representing victims of abuse by priests , johannes heibel , said müller 's decision to reassign peter k. was " more than scandalous . "
german psychoanalyst micha hilgers concurred , telling the dpa news agency that assigning peter k. to riekofen was " completely irresponsible . "
" it 's practically bizarre to put him in close proximity again to the situation in which he committed a crime , " hilgers added .
" therapy is possible , but a cure is not . "
recurring problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop müller said priests are responsible for their own behavior long a topic shrouded by secrecy , cases of pederasty among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not got involved in the riekofen affair .
" it 's a german matter , " dpa news agency quoted a source within radio vatican as saying .
" the bishop will have to justify his behavior to his fellow bishops . " in 2002 , the german bishops acted to head off such a crisis , with the conference of bishops issuing guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . müller has denied breaching the guideline , saying he had a christian duty to forgive and had been convinced that the paedophile priest had reformed his ways . but hilgers and others worry the priesthood may inherently attract people susceptible to pederasty and say the church needs to be more proactive about preventing cases like the one in riekofen .
" the bishop and the bishopric have a duty to keep an especially keen eye out for things like this , " hilgers told dpa .
" they should be conscious of the special risk .
that has been criminally neglected . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also called for more openness on this sensitive issue . the bishop of fulda , heinz josef algermissen , said his colleague bishop gerhard ludwig müller of regensburg made a mistake in offering a second chance to a priest with a history of pedophilia .
" if something has happened in the past with children , a new start should only be allowed at a distance from children , " algermissen told the bayern2 radio station .
the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .
müller reassigned the priest to the parish of riekofen , a village near regensburg , after that sentence expired .
police then arrested 39-year-old peter k. on aug .
30 for suspected sexual offences committed between 2003 and 2006 , and riekofen was given a new priest .
" nothing worse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop algermissen has been critical of what happened algermissen 's criticism of his colleague was all the more noteworthy because it came on the eve of the ongoing conference of german bishops in fulda .
algermissen called for an open discussion of the riekofen affair .
" there 's nothing worse for a bishop than a man of the cloth abusing people 's trust , " algermissen said .
" something like this is a true blow , and in view of what happened , you can feel half-sick . "
müller has justified his decision to reassign peter k. by saying he was guided by psychological evaluations showing that the priest did not have a pedophile fixation .
müller denies responsibility for any grotesque lapses in judgment .
" even a bishop ca n't rule out the possibility of a priest misusing the freedom -lsb- of his position -rsb- , " müller said in an interview with the catholic news agency kna .
" priests are not marionettes .
they themselves are responsible for what they do with parishioners . " calls for bishop 's resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is not getting involved at the moment but others remain outraged and were calling for müller to step down .
in a press conference , the head of a german initiative representing victims of abuse by priests , johannes heibel , said müller 's decision to reassign peter k. was " more than scandalous . "
german psychoanalyst micha hilgers concurred , telling the dpa news agency that assigning peter k. to riekofen was " completely irresponsible . "
" it 's practically bizarre to put him in close proximity again to the situation in which he committed a crime , " hilgers added .
" therapy is possible , but a cure is not . "
recurring problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop müller said priests are responsible for their own behavior long a topic shrouded by secrecy , cases of pederasty among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not got involved in the riekofen affair .
" it 's a german matter , " dpa news agency quoted a source within radio vatican as saying .
" the bishop will have to justify his behavior to his fellow bishops . " in 2002 , the german bishops acted to head off such a crisis , with the conference of bishops issuing guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . müller has denied breaching the guideline , saying he had a christian duty to forgive and had been convinced that the paedophile priest had reformed his ways . but hilgers and others worry the priesthood may inherently attract people susceptible to pederasty and say the church needs to be more proactive about preventing cases like the one in riekofen .
" the bishop and the bishopric have a duty to keep an especially keen eye out for things like this , " hilgers told dpa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 25.09.2007 diplomacy needed after dalai lama visit in germany , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sino-german relations are shaky after chancellor merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama china has again criticized german chancellor for her meeting with the dalai lama over the weekend .
on tuesday , china said it had damaged ties between the two countries and called on berlin to remedy the situation . dw-world.de spoke with china expert eberhard sandschneider of the german council on foreign relations in berlin about how sino-german relations could develop after the controversial meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama - tibet 's spiritual leader - at the chancellery on sunday , sept .
23 . dw-world.de : china cancelled two meetings with germany - one was a justice conference in munich , another was a traditional breakfast meeting between china 's and germany 's foreign ministers on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york .
now china is saying the foreign ministers should meet after all .
what 's all the somersaulting about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china expert eberhard sandschneider eberhard sandschneider : obviously , the meeting between chancellor merkel and the dalai lama has angered china and will do so for some time .
but , it 's certainly not in germany 's interest , nor in china 's , to see a downturn in bilateral relations .
china wants to make clear on a diplomatic level that the dalai lama meeting was not acceptable , but german diplomats have also tried to show to their chinese counterparts that this should not be the end of the dialogue and that we should get back to business as usual .
after all , this meeting -lsb- between merkel and the dalai lama -rsb- is not a core issue of german-chinese relations and should not be treated as such . was merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama a mistake ? the meeting was perfectly okay , but the place makes a difference .
it 's the first time the german chancellor has received the dalai lama at the chancellery itself , and that gives political clout to someone who certainly is n't a friend of the chinese government . it makes this visit , even though it 's been declared private , very political . it was a mistake in that it does not help german-chinese relations .
let me give you one example .
we are all watching what is going on in burma right now .
it would be absolutely helpful and necessary for german foreign minister steinmeier to pick up the phone and call his chinese counterpart to express interest in finding a solution in burma ; for the time being , that is not possible . what are other examples of where good sino-german relations are important ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was on friendly terms with chinese premier wen jiabao -lrb- r -rrb- during an august visit in beijing basically , all major aspects of international relations .
we know that it is not possible to solve any of these problems without china - be it climate change , iran , energy supply or north korea .
if one assumes that it is in our interest to have china cooperate , then it would make sense not to prevent cooperative behavior on the part of beijing .
it 's partly economic influence , but it 's far more .

if one assumes that it is in our interest to have china cooperate , then it would make sense not to prevent cooperative behavior on the part of beijing .
it 's partly economic influence , but it 's far more .
china is an important strategic partner for all the major issues on the international agenda , and also from a german perspective . still , is n't china actually interfering in germany 's affairs when it dictates with whom the chancellor should or should not meet ? theoretically , yes , it 's germany 's business , and i 'm not saying she should n't have met the dalai lama at all , but that is the game of playing interest against interest .
it is in the interest of our chancellor or even of the german government to be in dialogue with the dalai lama .
on the other hand , china has other interests , and whenever you have clashes of this kind , then a little more diplomacy is needed not to irritate bilateral relations .
it is not about dictating to each other what they should do , but about respecting each other , and only if you respect these differences can you work together in a more or less coordinated way . what are china 's interests in having good relations with germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke with students of the german-chinese law institute in nanjing in august we are one of its main trading partners - certainly the most important european trading partner .
china is interested in german technology and doing business with germany .
but , it also knows that whenever it comes to international coordination , europe is important and germany is important within europe , so there is a mutual interest in getting these things in order as soon as possible . you mentioned burma , what could china be doing to help ease the tensions there ? china is the only international actor who has some kind of pull with the junta in burma .
no other countries do .
china 's interests are clear : it cooperates both economically and militarily with burma .
so , it is in china 's interests to maintain stability there .
the chinese government certainly does not care whether it is a military leadership in burma or not , just as it does n't care about military regimes in africa .
but stability in the region is critical to china , and chinese representatives have made clear that they want the burmese military leaders to talk with the demonstrators and not shoot at them .
it remains to be seen whether or not china will take action . interview : louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also called for more openness on this sensitive issue . the bishop of fulda , heinz josef algermissen , said his colleague bishop gerhard ludwig müller of regensburg made a mistake in offering a second chance to a priest with a history of pedophilia .
" if something has happened in the past with children , a new start should only be allowed at a distance from children , " algermissen told the bayern2 radio station .
the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .
müller reassigned the priest to the parish of riekofen , a village near regensburg , after that sentence expired .

" there 's nothing worse for a bishop than a man of the cloth abusing people 's trust , " algermissen said .
" something like this is a true blow , and in view of what happened , you can feel half-sick . "
müller has justified his decision to reassign peter k. by saying he was guided by psychological evaluations showing that the priest did not have a pedophile fixation .
müller denies responsibility for any grotesque lapses in judgment .

" it 's a german matter , " dpa news agency quoted a source within radio vatican as saying .
" the bishop will have to justify his behavior to his fellow bishops . " in 2002 , the german bishops acted to head off such a crisis , with the conference of bishops issuing guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . müller has denied breaching the guideline , saying he had a christian duty to forgive and had been convinced that the paedophile priest had reformed his ways . but hilgers and others worry the priesthood may inherently attract people susceptible to pederasty and say the church needs to be more proactive about preventing cases like the one in riekofen .
" the bishop and the bishopric have a duty to keep an especially keen eye out for things like this , " hilgers told dpa .
" they should be conscious of the special risk .
that has been criminally neglected . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when the countries joined the bloc in 2004 , the eu set aside 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to help the countries catch up with their wealthier counterparts .
the funds were meant to pay for new schools , roads and promote job training .
money not being used bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grybauskaite said countries are set to lose but the money needs to be spent by the end of 2007 , grybauskaite said .
with only three months left to go , the countries have used only 57 percent of their structural funds on average and just 22 percent of their cohesion funds , according to figures provided by grybauskaite at a news conference .
the countries were cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
it is unlikely that they will get a second shot at spending the money .
" do n't dream about an endless possibility to absorb these funds , " grybauskaite warned .
" absorption levels are not satisfactory and time is running out . "
eu : no excuse for unspent money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries do n't have much time left to spend their eu aid money poland had done the worst job of spending its allocated money .
grybauskaite said the responsibility to allocate the money efficiently and quickly rested completely with the national governments .
" do n't look for excuses , because there will be no excuses .
if poland is n't able -lsb- to spend the money -rsb- , then poland loses out , " grybauskaite , a lithuanian , said at the press conference .
in 2006 , europe 's 25 member states -lsb- bulgaria and romania joined in 2007 -rsb- spent 91 percent of the eu 's 106.6 billion euro budget , according to official figures .
france led the way in raking in eu dollars , landing 13.5 billion euros in 2006 , of which 10 billion was for agricultural funds .
greece , lithuania and malta are the biggest beneficiaries after luxembourg , when viewed in terms of eu funds as a percentage of gross national income . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 .
she spoke at an unprecedented one-day united nations climate conference in new york . germany 's chancellor repeated her call for global solutions to cutting co2 emissions , encouraging countries to begin looking for a way to move forward efforts to combat climate change .
negotiating a successor to the kyoto protocol - a treaty which sets targets for industrial nations to reduce carbon emissions - is of crucial importance , merkel said , speaking before a un climate conference .
" it 's not only the dry facts and numbers that call us to negotiate , but also the question of in what future we want to live , " she said .
" for me , this is not only an economic imperative , but also a moral one . "
merkel called for global co2 emissions , a major man-made factor that contributes to global warming , to be halved by 2050 .
carbon trading suggested as a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the un to take the lead on combating climate change merkel suggested that a global carbon-trading scheme , which places a price on industries ' carbon-dioxide emissions , should play a " central role " in plans to fight global warming .
" only when greenhouse gases have a price will climate friendly technologies really become economically attractive , " she said .
her comments were echoed by others , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in 2005 , the european union introduced the world 's largest carbon trading scheme .
the plan has not worked as expected , since some countries gave their polluters large numbers of carbon credits .
yet europe still feels carbon trading is the way forward .
" our ultimate success will depend on developing the carbon market , " barroso said at the un climate conference monday .
looking beyond the kyoto protocol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean fuel is a necessity the eu has agreed to reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , but both merkel and barroso said that figure could be raised to 30 percent if a binding international deal included other regions .
" industrialized countries must play a pioneering role here , " merkel said .
" they have to set themselves ambitious reduction targets .
they have to demonstrate how they intend to achieve these targets . "
french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major polluters to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2050 .
he advocated the use of nuclear energy , france 's main power source , as a possible solution .
" it is not a question of choice between growth and protecting our world , " sarkozy said .
" we need clean growth .
a new economy must be invented . "
un secretary general ban ki-moon said monday 's conference achieved its goal of building momentum ahead of a critical december meeting in bali , indonesia .
there , negotiators will begin talks to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" this event has sent a powerful signal to the world ... that there is a will and determination at the highest level to break with the past and act decisively , " ban said .

24 .
she spoke at an unprecedented one-day united nations climate conference in new york . germany 's chancellor repeated her call for global solutions to cutting co2 emissions , encouraging countries to begin looking for a way to move forward efforts to combat climate change .
negotiating a successor to the kyoto protocol - a treaty which sets targets for industrial nations to reduce carbon emissions - is of crucial importance , merkel said , speaking before a un climate conference .
" it 's not only the dry facts and numbers that call us to negotiate , but also the question of in what future we want to live , " she said .
" for me , this is not only an economic imperative , but also a moral one . "
merkel called for global co2 emissions , a major man-made factor that contributes to global warming , to be halved by 2050 .
carbon trading suggested as a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the un to take the lead on combating climate change merkel suggested that a global carbon-trading scheme , which places a price on industries ' carbon-dioxide emissions , should play a " central role " in plans to fight global warming .
" only when greenhouse gases have a price will climate friendly technologies really become economically attractive , " she said .
her comments were echoed by others , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in 2005 , the european union introduced the world 's largest carbon trading scheme .
the plan has not worked as expected , since some countries gave their polluters large numbers of carbon credits .
yet europe still feels carbon trading is the way forward .
" our ultimate success will depend on developing the carbon market , " barroso said at the un climate conference monday .
looking beyond the kyoto protocol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean fuel is a necessity the eu has agreed to reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , but both merkel and barroso said that figure could be raised to 30 percent if a binding international deal included other regions .
" industrialized countries must play a pioneering role here , " merkel said .
" they have to set themselves ambitious reduction targets .
they have to demonstrate how they intend to achieve these targets . "

but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .

" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .

the recent agreement brought the project " nearer to being financially viable , " kampeter told the dpa news agency tuesday in berlin .

but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .

" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .

before people start accusing the chinese of rallying against their conquerors out of sour grapes , it must be pointed out that whenever china has n't been playing , the local fans have been cheering germany on in astounding numbers .
an expected 55,000 will be singing for the german team in tianjin , a similar number to those chinese who turned out to watch all of germany 's matches so far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 25.09.2007 german anti-terror measures fight for life as opposition grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble has proposed many of the anti-terror measures under debate germany 's interior and defense ministries have been busy rolling out potential anti-terror measures over the past weeks .
but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .

but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .

germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "
biometrics up and running despite opposition in another move to increase security , germany will start adding fingerprints to its biometric passports from nov .

" many germans see the benefits of this increased security and accept the collection of data , " hofmann said .

but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women 's soccer -pipe- 25.09.2007 chinese fans put the red into germany 's red , black and gold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer captain birgit prinz is a big star in china where her team has huge support their team might have been knocked out of the women 's world cup , but china 's fans wo n't be sitting at home moping .
after the hosts were eliminated by norway , germany will feel the full force of china 's support . germany 's women 's soccer team will have the support of the people 's republic as they take on the hosts ' victors norway in the first semi-final on wednesday , sept .
26 .
before people start accusing the chinese of rallying against their conquerors out of sour grapes , it must be pointed out that whenever china has n't been playing , the local fans have been cheering germany on in astounding numbers .
an expected 55,000 will be singing for the german team in tianjin , a similar number to those chinese who turned out to watch all of germany 's matches so far .
" there always seems to be more chinese support at our games than at any of the other games in which the chinese are n't playing , " said german goalkeeper nadine angerer .
" it 's pretty clear that german soccer is liked here very much . "
every self-respecting chinese fan knows about the careers of legends such as germany 's most-capped player lothar matthäus and " kaiser " franz beckenbauer but since the women 's team arrived to begin their title defense in china , the locals have found a new team of teutonic idols .
with 16 goals so far in this tournament , the high-scoring germans tick all the right boxes for chinese fans brought up on fast action and avalanches of goals .
" the chinese want to see attack after attack , " said german klaus schlappner who coached china 's men 's team from 1992 to 1995 .
china 's support hits heights against japan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's win over japan pleased the chinese fans while the chinese fans followed germany 's displays against argentina and england with appreciation , true fandom hit when the germans eliminated local rivals japan from the championship .
with rolling chants of " deguo , deguo " - " germany , germany " - the chinese added their voice to the german fans ' and celebrated just as wildly as their arch-rivals were sent packing .
the fanaticism is n't just restricted to the stadiums either .
everywhere the german squad goes , a legion of chinese fans follows .
easily spotted in their team leisurewear in shops and cafes , the german players are besieged for photographs and mementos .
" about 99 percent want the autograph of birgit prinz , " smiled defender ariane hingst .
germany 's star woman , a three-time world player of the year , is a megastar in soccer-crazy asia and the announcement of her name before matches causes a frenzy in the crowd .
" i had no idea that they knew me over here , " prinz said .
communism beats popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's fans favored north korea against germany despite the adoration , there are some things that do take precedence over popularity .
when germany were 3-0 up and cruising against north korea on saturday , chinese voices were leant in support to their beleaguered communist sisters .
no-one felt betrayed .
" if the spectators support us , it is great fun , " said german midfielder simone laudehr .
" if they shout for the others , then that 's only more motivation for us . "
the loyalty of the chinese fans to germany is unlikely to come into question on wednesday when norway , narrow 1-0 winners over the hosts , will feel the heat of the locals after what was seen to be a lucky quarter-final win .
the noise is expected to be only marginally less than if the chinese were meeting germany themselves for a place in the world cup final .

before people start accusing the chinese of rallying against their conquerors out of sour grapes , it must be pointed out that whenever china has n't been playing , the local fans have been cheering germany on in astounding numbers .
an expected 55,000 will be singing for the german team in tianjin , a similar number to those chinese who turned out to watch all of germany 's matches so far .

he also called for more openness on this sensitive issue . the bishop of fulda , heinz josef algermissen , said his colleague bishop gerhard ludwig müller of regensburg made a mistake in offering a second chance to a priest with a history of pedophilia .
" if something has happened in the past with children , a new start should only be allowed at a distance from children , " algermissen told the bayern2 radio station .
the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .
müller reassigned the priest to the parish of riekofen , a village near regensburg , after that sentence expired .
police then arrested 39-year-old peter k. on aug .
30 for suspected sexual offences committed between 2003 and 2006 , and riekofen was given a new priest .
" nothing worse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop algermissen has been critical of what happened algermissen 's criticism of his colleague was all the more noteworthy because it came on the eve of the ongoing conference of german bishops in fulda .
algermissen called for an open discussion of the riekofen affair .
" there 's nothing worse for a bishop than a man of the cloth abusing people 's trust , " algermissen said .
" something like this is a true blow , and in view of what happened , you can feel half-sick . "
müller has justified his decision to reassign peter k. by saying he was guided by psychological evaluations showing that the priest did not have a pedophile fixation .
müller denies responsibility for any grotesque lapses in judgment .
" even a bishop ca n't rule out the possibility of a priest misusing the freedom -lsb- of his position -rsb- , " müller said in an interview with the catholic news agency kna .
" priests are not marionettes .
they themselves are responsible for what they do with parishioners . " calls for bishop 's resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is not getting involved at the moment but others remain outraged and were calling for müller to step down .
in a press conference , the head of a german initiative representing victims of abuse by priests , johannes heibel , said müller 's decision to reassign peter k. was " more than scandalous . "
german psychoanalyst micha hilgers concurred , telling the dpa news agency that assigning peter k. to riekofen was " completely irresponsible . "
" it 's practically bizarre to put him in close proximity again to the situation in which he committed a crime , " hilgers added .
" therapy is possible , but a cure is not . "
recurring problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop müller said priests are responsible for their own behavior long a topic shrouded by secrecy , cases of pederasty among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not got involved in the riekofen affair .
" it 's a german matter , " dpa news agency quoted a source within radio vatican as saying .
" the bishop will have to justify his behavior to his fellow bishops . " in 2002 , the german bishops acted to head off such a crisis , with the conference of bishops issuing guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . müller has denied breaching the guideline , saying he had a christian duty to forgive and had been convinced that the paedophile priest had reformed his ways . but hilgers and others worry the priesthood may inherently attract people susceptible to pederasty and say the church needs to be more proactive about preventing cases like the one in riekofen .
" the bishop and the bishopric have a duty to keep an especially keen eye out for things like this , " hilgers told dpa .
" they should be conscious of the special risk .
that has been criminally neglected . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 25.09.2007 german anti-terror measures fight for life as opposition grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble has proposed many of the anti-terror measures under debate germany 's interior and defense ministries have been busy rolling out potential anti-terror measures over the past weeks .
but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "
biometrics up and running despite opposition in another move to increase security , germany will start adding fingerprints to its biometric passports from nov .

" many germans see the benefits of this increased security and accept the collection of data , " hofmann said .
" people have got used to this as part of life .

the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "
biometrics up and running despite opposition in another move to increase security , germany will start adding fingerprints to its biometric passports from nov .

" many germans see the benefits of this increased security and accept the collection of data , " hofmann said .

but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .

but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .

the transrapid will hover on a track above the ground and will travel at speeds up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour .

stoiber denied that the transrapid was being done as a personal favor , saying tuesday that the project was the " guiding light for high technology made in germany . "

so far , the technology has not been broadly adopted due to safety concerns .

germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .
the city of munich is also unhappy about the tranrapid .
munich 's socialist mayor , christian ude , said he will fight in court against the plan .

the recent agreement brought the project " nearer to being financially viable , " kampeter told the dpa news agency tuesday in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 25.09.2007 german bishop criticizes reassignment of pedophilic priest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the priest was assigned to this parish church after being convicted of pedophiliac crimes the host of a bishops ' conference in southern germany has taken one of his peers to task for reassigning a priest with a history of sexual abuse to a new parish .
he also called for more openness on this sensitive issue . the bishop of fulda , heinz josef algermissen , said his colleague bishop gerhard ludwig müller of regensburg made a mistake in offering a second chance to a priest with a history of pedophilia .
" if something has happened in the past with children , a new start should only be allowed at a distance from children , " algermissen told the bayern2 radio station .
the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .
müller reassigned the priest to the parish of riekofen , a village near regensburg , after that sentence expired .
police then arrested 39-year-old peter k. on aug .
30 for suspected sexual offences committed between 2003 and 2006 , and riekofen was given a new priest .
" nothing worse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop algermissen has been critical of what happened algermissen 's criticism of his colleague was all the more noteworthy because it came on the eve of the ongoing conference of german bishops in fulda .
algermissen called for an open discussion of the riekofen affair .
" there 's nothing worse for a bishop than a man of the cloth abusing people 's trust , " algermissen said .
" something like this is a true blow , and in view of what happened , you can feel half-sick . "
müller has justified his decision to reassign peter k. by saying he was guided by psychological evaluations showing that the priest did not have a pedophile fixation .
müller denies responsibility for any grotesque lapses in judgment .
" even a bishop ca n't rule out the possibility of a priest misusing the freedom -lsb- of his position -rsb- , " müller said in an interview with the catholic news agency kna .
" priests are not marionettes .
they themselves are responsible for what they do with parishioners . " calls for bishop 's resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is not getting involved at the moment but others remain outraged and were calling for müller to step down .
in a press conference , the head of a german initiative representing victims of abuse by priests , johannes heibel , said müller 's decision to reassign peter k. was " more than scandalous . "
german psychoanalyst micha hilgers concurred , telling the dpa news agency that assigning peter k. to riekofen was " completely irresponsible . "
" it 's practically bizarre to put him in close proximity again to the situation in which he committed a crime , " hilgers added .
" therapy is possible , but a cure is not . "
recurring problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop müller said priests are responsible for their own behavior long a topic shrouded by secrecy , cases of pederasty among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not got involved in the riekofen affair .
" it 's a german matter , " dpa news agency quoted a source within radio vatican as saying .
" the bishop will have to justify his behavior to his fellow bishops . " in 2002 , the german bishops acted to head off such a crisis , with the conference of bishops issuing guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . müller has denied breaching the guideline , saying he had a christian duty to forgive and had been convinced that the paedophile priest had reformed his ways . but hilgers and others worry the priesthood may inherently attract people susceptible to pederasty and say the church needs to be more proactive about preventing cases like the one in riekofen .
" the bishop and the bishopric have a duty to keep an especially keen eye out for things like this , " hilgers told dpa .
" they should be conscious of the special risk .
that has been criminally neglected . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when the countries joined the bloc in 2004 , the eu set aside 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to help the countries catch up with their wealthier counterparts .
the funds were meant to pay for new schools , roads and promote job training .
money not being used bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grybauskaite said countries are set to lose but the money needs to be spent by the end of 2007 , grybauskaite said .
with only three months left to go , the countries have used only 57 percent of their structural funds on average and just 22 percent of their cohesion funds , according to figures provided by grybauskaite at a news conference .
the countries were cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
it is unlikely that they will get a second shot at spending the money .
" do n't dream about an endless possibility to absorb these funds , " grybauskaite warned .
" absorption levels are not satisfactory and time is running out . "
eu : no excuse for unspent money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries do n't have much time left to spend their eu aid money poland had done the worst job of spending its allocated money .
grybauskaite said the responsibility to allocate the money efficiently and quickly rested completely with the national governments .
" do n't look for excuses , because there will be no excuses .
if poland is n't able -lsb- to spend the money -rsb- , then poland loses out , " grybauskaite , a lithuanian , said at the press conference .
in 2006 , europe 's 25 member states -lsb- bulgaria and romania joined in 2007 -rsb- spent 91 percent of the eu 's 106.6 billion euro budget , according to official figures .
france led the way in raking in eu dollars , landing 13.5 billion euros in 2006 , of which 10 billion was for agricultural funds .
greece , lithuania and malta are the biggest beneficiaries after luxembourg , when viewed in terms of eu funds as a percentage of gross national income . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economists say the flat tax trend wo n't likely spread from eastern to western europe .

on tuesday , china said it had damaged ties between the two countries and called on berlin to remedy the situation . dw-world.de spoke with china expert eberhard sandschneider of the german council on foreign relations in berlin about how sino-german relations could develop after the controversial meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama - tibet 's spiritual leader - at the chancellery on sunday , sept .
23 . dw-world.de : china cancelled two meetings with germany - one was a justice conference in munich , another was a traditional breakfast meeting between china 's and germany 's foreign ministers on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york .
now china is saying the foreign ministers should meet after all .
what 's all the somersaulting about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china expert eberhard sandschneider eberhard sandschneider : obviously , the meeting between chancellor merkel and the dalai lama has angered china and will do so for some time .
but , it 's certainly not in germany 's interest , nor in china 's , to see a downturn in bilateral relations .
china wants to make clear on a diplomatic level that the dalai lama meeting was not acceptable , but german diplomats have also tried to show to their chinese counterparts that this should not be the end of the dialogue and that we should get back to business as usual .
after all , this meeting -lsb- between merkel and the dalai lama -rsb- is not a core issue of german-chinese relations and should not be treated as such . was merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama a mistake ? the meeting was perfectly okay , but the place makes a difference .
it 's the first time the german chancellor has received the dalai lama at the chancellery itself , and that gives political clout to someone who certainly is n't a friend of the chinese government . it makes this visit , even though it 's been declared private , very political . it was a mistake in that it does not help german-chinese relations .
let me give you one example .
we are all watching what is going on in burma right now .
it would be absolutely helpful and necessary for german foreign minister steinmeier to pick up the phone and call his chinese counterpart to express interest in finding a solution in burma ; for the time being , that is not possible . what are other examples of where good sino-german relations are important ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was on friendly terms with chinese premier wen jiabao -lrb- r -rrb- during an august visit in beijing basically , all major aspects of international relations .
we know that it is not possible to solve any of these problems without china - be it climate change , iran , energy supply or north korea .
if one assumes that it is in our interest to have china cooperate , then it would make sense not to prevent cooperative behavior on the part of beijing .
it 's partly economic influence , but it 's far more .
china is an important strategic partner for all the major issues on the international agenda , and also from a german perspective . still , is n't china actually interfering in germany 's affairs when it dictates with whom the chancellor should or should not meet ? theoretically , yes , it 's germany 's business , and i 'm not saying she should n't have met the dalai lama at all , but that is the game of playing interest against interest .
it is in the interest of our chancellor or even of the german government to be in dialogue with the dalai lama .
on the other hand , china has other interests , and whenever you have clashes of this kind , then a little more diplomacy is needed not to irritate bilateral relations .
it is not about dictating to each other what they should do , but about respecting each other , and only if you respect these differences can you work together in a more or less coordinated way . what are china 's interests in having good relations with germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke with students of the german-chinese law institute in nanjing in august we are one of its main trading partners - certainly the most important european trading partner .
china is interested in german technology and doing business with germany .
but , it also knows that whenever it comes to international coordination , europe is important and germany is important within europe , so there is a mutual interest in getting these things in order as soon as possible . you mentioned burma , what could china be doing to help ease the tensions there ? china is the only international actor who has some kind of pull with the junta in burma .
no other countries do .
china 's interests are clear : it cooperates both economically and militarily with burma .
so , it is in china 's interests to maintain stability there .
the chinese government certainly does not care whether it is a military leadership in burma or not , just as it does n't care about military regimes in africa .
but stability in the region is critical to china , and chinese representatives have made clear that they want the burmese military leaders to talk with the demonstrators and not shoot at them .
it remains to be seen whether or not china will take action . interview : louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 25.09.2007 german anti-terror measures fight for life as opposition grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble has proposed many of the anti-terror measures under debate germany 's interior and defense ministries have been busy rolling out potential anti-terror measures over the past weeks .
but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "
biometrics up and running despite opposition in another move to increase security , germany will start adding fingerprints to its biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fingerprints will be added to the biometric passports opponents of the biometric system and a proposed biometric database accuse the federal and state governments of establishing the systems despite the public 's privacy and security concerns and with little open debate . meanwhile , supporters say biometric passports create an unrivaled level of security and protection against the counterfeit identification papers often used by terrorists and other criminals .
" many germans see the benefits of this increased security and accept the collection of data , " hofmann said .
" people have got used to this as part of life .
some , however , see this as part of the creation of a global surveillance structure where everybody 's whereabouts are known .
but whichever way you look at it , biometrics are a reality .
it 's a done deal . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china wants to make clear on a diplomatic level that the dalai lama meeting was not acceptable , but german diplomats have also tried to show to their chinese counterparts that this should not be the end of the dialogue and that we should get back to business as usual .
after all , this meeting -lsb- between merkel and the dalai lama -rsb- is not a core issue of german-chinese relations and should not be treated as such . was merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama a mistake ? the meeting was perfectly okay , but the place makes a difference .
it 's the first time the german chancellor has received the dalai lama at the chancellery itself , and that gives political clout to someone who certainly is n't a friend of the chinese government . it makes this visit , even though it 's been declared private , very political . it was a mistake in that it does not help german-chinese relations .
let me give you one example .
we are all watching what is going on in burma right now .
it would be absolutely helpful and necessary for german foreign minister steinmeier to pick up the phone and call his chinese counterpart to express interest in finding a solution in burma ; for the time being , that is not possible . what are other examples of where good sino-german relations are important ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was on friendly terms with chinese premier wen jiabao -lrb- r -rrb- during an august visit in beijing basically , all major aspects of international relations .
we know that it is not possible to solve any of these problems without china - be it climate change , iran , energy supply or north korea .
if one assumes that it is in our interest to have china cooperate , then it would make sense not to prevent cooperative behavior on the part of beijing .
it 's partly economic influence , but it 's far more .
china is an important strategic partner for all the major issues on the international agenda , and also from a german perspective . still , is n't china actually interfering in germany 's affairs when it dictates with whom the chancellor should or should not meet ? theoretically , yes , it 's germany 's business , and i 'm not saying she should n't have met the dalai lama at all , but that is the game of playing interest against interest .
it is in the interest of our chancellor or even of the german government to be in dialogue with the dalai lama .
on the other hand , china has other interests , and whenever you have clashes of this kind , then a little more diplomacy is needed not to irritate bilateral relations .
it is not about dictating to each other what they should do , but about respecting each other , and only if you respect these differences can you work together in a more or less coordinated way . what are china 's interests in having good relations with germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke with students of the german-chinese law institute in nanjing in august we are one of its main trading partners - certainly the most important european trading partner .
china is interested in german technology and doing business with germany .
but , it also knows that whenever it comes to international coordination , europe is important and germany is important within europe , so there is a mutual interest in getting these things in order as soon as possible . you mentioned burma , what could china be doing to help ease the tensions there ? china is the only international actor who has some kind of pull with the junta in burma .
no other countries do .
china 's interests are clear : it cooperates both economically and militarily with burma .
so , it is in china 's interests to maintain stability there .
the chinese government certainly does not care whether it is a military leadership in burma or not , just as it does n't care about military regimes in africa .
but stability in the region is critical to china , and chinese representatives have made clear that they want the burmese military leaders to talk with the demonstrators and not shoot at them .
it remains to be seen whether or not china will take action . interview : louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

before people start accusing the chinese of rallying against their conquerors out of sour grapes , it must be pointed out that whenever china has n't been playing , the local fans have been cheering germany on in astounding numbers .
an expected 55,000 will be singing for the german team in tianjin , a similar number to those chinese who turned out to watch all of germany 's matches so far .
" there always seems to be more chinese support at our games than at any of the other games in which the chinese are n't playing , " said german goalkeeper nadine angerer .
" it 's pretty clear that german soccer is liked here very much . "
every self-respecting chinese fan knows about the careers of legends such as germany 's most-capped player lothar matthäus and " kaiser " franz beckenbauer but since the women 's team arrived to begin their title defense in china , the locals have found a new team of teutonic idols .
with 16 goals so far in this tournament , the high-scoring germans tick all the right boxes for chinese fans brought up on fast action and avalanches of goals .

the loyalty of the chinese fans to germany is unlikely to come into question on wednesday when norway , narrow 1-0 winners over the hosts , will feel the heat of the locals after what was seen to be a lucky quarter-final win .

" if they shout for the others , then that 's only more motivation for us . "
the loyalty of the chinese fans to germany is unlikely to come into question on wednesday when norway , narrow 1-0 winners over the hosts , will feel the heat of the locals after what was seen to be a lucky quarter-final win .
the noise is expected to be only marginally less than if the chinese were meeting germany themselves for a place in the world cup final .
norway stands between holders and final germany will be looking to feed off whatever support they can get .
while they have only really struggled once in the tournament so far , laboring to a 0-0 draw with england , the norwegians are tough customers who are far from unknown to the world champions .
the germans and norwegians have faced off 28 times in the past , with 12 going germany 's way , 11 to norway and five draws .
" norway always belongs among the top nations , " said prinz .
" it will be the same here .
we can say from intense experience that we expect nothing less . "

he also called for more openness on this sensitive issue . the bishop of fulda , heinz josef algermissen , said his colleague bishop gerhard ludwig müller of regensburg made a mistake in offering a second chance to a priest with a history of pedophilia .
" if something has happened in the past with children , a new start should only be allowed at a distance from children , " algermissen told the bayern2 radio station .
the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .
müller reassigned the priest to the parish of riekofen , a village near regensburg , after that sentence expired .
police then arrested 39-year-old peter k. on aug .
30 for suspected sexual offences committed between 2003 and 2006 , and riekofen was given a new priest .
" nothing worse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop algermissen has been critical of what happened algermissen 's criticism of his colleague was all the more noteworthy because it came on the eve of the ongoing conference of german bishops in fulda .
algermissen called for an open discussion of the riekofen affair .
" there 's nothing worse for a bishop than a man of the cloth abusing people 's trust , " algermissen said .
" something like this is a true blow , and in view of what happened , you can feel half-sick . "
müller has justified his decision to reassign peter k. by saying he was guided by psychological evaluations showing that the priest did not have a pedophile fixation .
müller denies responsibility for any grotesque lapses in judgment .
" even a bishop ca n't rule out the possibility of a priest misusing the freedom -lsb- of his position -rsb- , " müller said in an interview with the catholic news agency kna .
" priests are not marionettes .
they themselves are responsible for what they do with parishioners . " calls for bishop 's resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is not getting involved at the moment but others remain outraged and were calling for müller to step down .
in a press conference , the head of a german initiative representing victims of abuse by priests , johannes heibel , said müller 's decision to reassign peter k. was " more than scandalous . "
german psychoanalyst micha hilgers concurred , telling the dpa news agency that assigning peter k. to riekofen was " completely irresponsible . "
" it 's practically bizarre to put him in close proximity again to the situation in which he committed a crime , " hilgers added .
" therapy is possible , but a cure is not . "
recurring problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop müller said priests are responsible for their own behavior long a topic shrouded by secrecy , cases of pederasty among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not got involved in the riekofen affair .
" it 's a german matter , " dpa news agency quoted a source within radio vatican as saying .
" the bishop will have to justify his behavior to his fellow bishops . " in 2002 , the german bishops acted to head off such a crisis , with the conference of bishops issuing guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . müller has denied breaching the guideline , saying he had a christian duty to forgive and had been convinced that the paedophile priest had reformed his ways . but hilgers and others worry the priesthood may inherently attract people susceptible to pederasty and say the church needs to be more proactive about preventing cases like the one in riekofen .
" the bishop and the bishopric have a duty to keep an especially keen eye out for things like this , " hilgers told dpa .
" they should be conscious of the special risk .
that has been criminally neglected . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 .
she spoke at an unprecedented one-day united nations climate conference in new york . germany 's chancellor repeated her call for global solutions to cutting co2 emissions , encouraging countries to begin looking for a way to move forward efforts to combat climate change .
negotiating a successor to the kyoto protocol - a treaty which sets targets for industrial nations to reduce carbon emissions - is of crucial importance , merkel said , speaking before a un climate conference .
" it 's not only the dry facts and numbers that call us to negotiate , but also the question of in what future we want to live , " she said .
" for me , this is not only an economic imperative , but also a moral one . "
merkel called for global co2 emissions , a major man-made factor that contributes to global warming , to be halved by 2050 .
carbon trading suggested as a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the un to take the lead on combating climate change merkel suggested that a global carbon-trading scheme , which places a price on industries ' carbon-dioxide emissions , should play a " central role " in plans to fight global warming .
" only when greenhouse gases have a price will climate friendly technologies really become economically attractive , " she said .
her comments were echoed by others , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in 2005 , the european union introduced the world 's largest carbon trading scheme .
the plan has not worked as expected , since some countries gave their polluters large numbers of carbon credits .
yet europe still feels carbon trading is the way forward .
" our ultimate success will depend on developing the carbon market , " barroso said at the un climate conference monday .
looking beyond the kyoto protocol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean fuel is a necessity the eu has agreed to reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , but both merkel and barroso said that figure could be raised to 30 percent if a binding international deal included other regions .
" industrialized countries must play a pioneering role here , " merkel said .
" they have to set themselves ambitious reduction targets .
they have to demonstrate how they intend to achieve these targets . "
french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major polluters to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2050 .
he advocated the use of nuclear energy , france 's main power source , as a possible solution .
" it is not a question of choice between growth and protecting our world , " sarkozy said .
" we need clean growth .
a new economy must be invented . "
un secretary general ban ki-moon said monday 's conference achieved its goal of building momentum ahead of a critical december meeting in bali , indonesia .
there , negotiators will begin talks to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" this event has sent a powerful signal to the world ... that there is a will and determination at the highest level to break with the past and act decisively , " ban said .
the us called on to take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man of action while california governor arnold schwarzenegger did address the conference , calling for " action , action , action , " on climate change , united states president george w. bush was conspicuously absent .
the us never ratified kyoto and has been reluctant to endorse ideas like carbon trading .
bush plans to hold his own conference on climate change in washington later this week .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said that new technologies were at the heart of us efforts to combat global warming .
" the world needs a technological revolution , " rice said monday , adding that the world must find ways to " transcend " fossil fuels in the search for clean , renewable alternatives .
monday 's address was the merkel 's first visit to the united nations as chancellor .

she spoke at an unprecedented one-day united nations climate conference in new york . germany 's chancellor repeated her call for global solutions to cutting co2 emissions , encouraging countries to begin looking for a way to move forward efforts to combat climate change .
negotiating a successor to the kyoto protocol - a treaty which sets targets for industrial nations to reduce carbon emissions - is of crucial importance , merkel said , speaking before a un climate conference .
" it 's not only the dry facts and numbers that call us to negotiate , but also the question of in what future we want to live , " she said .
" for me , this is not only an economic imperative , but also a moral one . "
merkel called for global co2 emissions , a major man-made factor that contributes to global warming , to be halved by 2050 .
carbon trading suggested as a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the un to take the lead on combating climate change merkel suggested that a global carbon-trading scheme , which places a price on industries ' carbon-dioxide emissions , should play a " central role " in plans to fight global warming .
" only when greenhouse gases have a price will climate friendly technologies really become economically attractive , " she said .
her comments were echoed by others , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in 2005 , the european union introduced the world 's largest carbon trading scheme .
the plan has not worked as expected , since some countries gave their polluters large numbers of carbon credits .
yet europe still feels carbon trading is the way forward .
" our ultimate success will depend on developing the carbon market , " barroso said at the un climate conference monday .

" industrialized countries must play a pioneering role here , " merkel said .
" they have to set themselves ambitious reduction targets .
they have to demonstrate how they intend to achieve these targets . "
french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major polluters to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2050 .
he advocated the use of nuclear energy , france 's main power source , as a possible solution .
" it is not a question of choice between growth and protecting our world , " sarkozy said .
" we need clean growth .
a new economy must be invented . "
un secretary general ban ki-moon said monday 's conference achieved its goal of building momentum ahead of a critical december meeting in bali , indonesia .
there , negotiators will begin talks to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 25.09.2007 diplomacy needed after dalai lama visit in germany , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sino-german relations are shaky after chancellor merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama china has again criticized german chancellor for her meeting with the dalai lama over the weekend .
on tuesday , china said it had damaged ties between the two countries and called on berlin to remedy the situation . dw-world.de spoke with china expert eberhard sandschneider of the german council on foreign relations in berlin about how sino-german relations could develop after the controversial meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama - tibet 's spiritual leader - at the chancellery on sunday , sept .
23 . dw-world.de : china cancelled two meetings with germany - one was a justice conference in munich , another was a traditional breakfast meeting between china 's and germany 's foreign ministers on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york .
now china is saying the foreign ministers should meet after all .
what 's all the somersaulting about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china expert eberhard sandschneider eberhard sandschneider : obviously , the meeting between chancellor merkel and the dalai lama has angered china and will do so for some time .
but , it 's certainly not in germany 's interest , nor in china 's , to see a downturn in bilateral relations .
china wants to make clear on a diplomatic level that the dalai lama meeting was not acceptable , but german diplomats have also tried to show to their chinese counterparts that this should not be the end of the dialogue and that we should get back to business as usual .
after all , this meeting -lsb- between merkel and the dalai lama -rsb- is not a core issue of german-chinese relations and should not be treated as such . was merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama a mistake ? the meeting was perfectly okay , but the place makes a difference .
it 's the first time the german chancellor has received the dalai lama at the chancellery itself , and that gives political clout to someone who certainly is n't a friend of the chinese government . it makes this visit , even though it 's been declared private , very political . it was a mistake in that it does not help german-chinese relations .
let me give you one example .
we are all watching what is going on in burma right now .
it would be absolutely helpful and necessary for german foreign minister steinmeier to pick up the phone and call his chinese counterpart to express interest in finding a solution in burma ; for the time being , that is not possible . what are other examples of where good sino-german relations are important ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was on friendly terms with chinese premier wen jiabao -lrb- r -rrb- during an august visit in beijing basically , all major aspects of international relations .
we know that it is not possible to solve any of these problems without china - be it climate change , iran , energy supply or north korea .
if one assumes that it is in our interest to have china cooperate , then it would make sense not to prevent cooperative behavior on the part of beijing .
it 's partly economic influence , but it 's far more .
china is an important strategic partner for all the major issues on the international agenda , and also from a german perspective . still , is n't china actually interfering in germany 's affairs when it dictates with whom the chancellor should or should not meet ? theoretically , yes , it 's germany 's business , and i 'm not saying she should n't have met the dalai lama at all , but that is the game of playing interest against interest .
it is in the interest of our chancellor or even of the german government to be in dialogue with the dalai lama .
on the other hand , china has other interests , and whenever you have clashes of this kind , then a little more diplomacy is needed not to irritate bilateral relations .
it is not about dictating to each other what they should do , but about respecting each other , and only if you respect these differences can you work together in a more or less coordinated way . what are china 's interests in having good relations with germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke with students of the german-chinese law institute in nanjing in august we are one of its main trading partners - certainly the most important european trading partner .
china is interested in german technology and doing business with germany .
but , it also knows that whenever it comes to international coordination , europe is important and germany is important within europe , so there is a mutual interest in getting these things in order as soon as possible . you mentioned burma , what could china be doing to help ease the tensions there ? china is the only international actor who has some kind of pull with the junta in burma .
no other countries do .
china 's interests are clear : it cooperates both economically and militarily with burma .
so , it is in china 's interests to maintain stability there .
the chinese government certainly does not care whether it is a military leadership in burma or not , just as it does n't care about military regimes in africa .
but stability in the region is critical to china , and chinese representatives have made clear that they want the burmese military leaders to talk with the demonstrators and not shoot at them .
it remains to be seen whether or not china will take action . interview : louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .

germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .

but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .
24 .
the transrapid will hover on a track above the ground and will travel at speeds up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour .
the 37-kilometer -lrb- 23-mile -rrb- route is scheduled to be completed by 2014 .
technology made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's " parting gift " the project is seen by critics as a " parting gift " for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
after 14 in power , stoiber will step down next month .
stoiber denied that the transrapid was being done as a personal favor , saying tuesday that the project was the " guiding light for high technology made in germany . "
german engineering giants siemens and thyssenkrupp developed the project .
so far , the technology has not been broadly adopted due to safety concerns .
in september 2006 , 23 people died and 11 were injured when a transrapid crashed into a maintenance vehicle during a test run near the western german city of osnabrück .
currently only china has an operational transrapid track .
it runs between shanghai and the city 's airport .
government warns of cost overruns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only operational transrapid is in shanghai as part of the deal , the german government will pay no more than 925 million euros for the magnetic levitation train and has stipulated it will not be responsible for cost overruns .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .
the city of munich is also unhappy about the tranrapid .
munich 's socialist mayor , christian ude , said he will fight in court against the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accident last year killed 23 people " naturally , the regional capital of munich will initiate legal measures against the plan 's official approval , " ude was quoted as saying by reuters news agency .
while this week 's financial agreement was an important step , cdu expert steffen kampeter said it does n't mean the project will get a green light in the end .
the recent agreement brought the project " nearer to being financially viable , " kampeter told the dpa news agency tuesday in berlin .
" the devil is in the details , " he said .
stoiber said he was confident the project would go forward despite ongoing opposition .
" nobody will reverse this step , " he said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on tuesday , china said it had damaged ties between the two countries and called on berlin to remedy the situation . dw-world.de spoke with china expert eberhard sandschneider of the german council on foreign relations in berlin about how sino-german relations could develop after the controversial meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama - tibet 's spiritual leader - at the chancellery on sunday , sept .
23 . dw-world.de : china cancelled two meetings with germany - one was a justice conference in munich , another was a traditional breakfast meeting between china 's and germany 's foreign ministers on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york .
now china is saying the foreign ministers should meet after all .
what 's all the somersaulting about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china expert eberhard sandschneider eberhard sandschneider : obviously , the meeting between chancellor merkel and the dalai lama has angered china and will do so for some time .
but , it 's certainly not in germany 's interest , nor in china 's , to see a downturn in bilateral relations .
china wants to make clear on a diplomatic level that the dalai lama meeting was not acceptable , but german diplomats have also tried to show to their chinese counterparts that this should not be the end of the dialogue and that we should get back to business as usual .
after all , this meeting -lsb- between merkel and the dalai lama -rsb- is not a core issue of german-chinese relations and should not be treated as such . was merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama a mistake ? the meeting was perfectly okay , but the place makes a difference .
it 's the first time the german chancellor has received the dalai lama at the chancellery itself , and that gives political clout to someone who certainly is n't a friend of the chinese government . it makes this visit , even though it 's been declared private , very political . it was a mistake in that it does not help german-chinese relations .
let me give you one example .
we are all watching what is going on in burma right now .
it would be absolutely helpful and necessary for german foreign minister steinmeier to pick up the phone and call his chinese counterpart to express interest in finding a solution in burma ; for the time being , that is not possible . what are other examples of where good sino-german relations are important ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was on friendly terms with chinese premier wen jiabao -lrb- r -rrb- during an august visit in beijing basically , all major aspects of international relations .
we know that it is not possible to solve any of these problems without china - be it climate change , iran , energy supply or north korea .
if one assumes that it is in our interest to have china cooperate , then it would make sense not to prevent cooperative behavior on the part of beijing .
it 's partly economic influence , but it 's far more .
china is an important strategic partner for all the major issues on the international agenda , and also from a german perspective . still , is n't china actually interfering in germany 's affairs when it dictates with whom the chancellor should or should not meet ? theoretically , yes , it 's germany 's business , and i 'm not saying she should n't have met the dalai lama at all , but that is the game of playing interest against interest .
it is in the interest of our chancellor or even of the german government to be in dialogue with the dalai lama .
on the other hand , china has other interests , and whenever you have clashes of this kind , then a little more diplomacy is needed not to irritate bilateral relations .
it is not about dictating to each other what they should do , but about respecting each other , and only if you respect these differences can you work together in a more or less coordinated way . what are china 's interests in having good relations with germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke with students of the german-chinese law institute in nanjing in august we are one of its main trading partners - certainly the most important european trading partner .
china is interested in german technology and doing business with germany .
but , it also knows that whenever it comes to international coordination , europe is important and germany is important within europe , so there is a mutual interest in getting these things in order as soon as possible . you mentioned burma , what could china be doing to help ease the tensions there ? china is the only international actor who has some kind of pull with the junta in burma .
no other countries do .
china 's interests are clear : it cooperates both economically and militarily with burma .
so , it is in china 's interests to maintain stability there .
the chinese government certainly does not care whether it is a military leadership in burma or not , just as it does n't care about military regimes in africa .

on tuesday , china said it had damaged ties between the two countries and called on berlin to remedy the situation . dw-world.de spoke with china expert eberhard sandschneider of the german council on foreign relations in berlin about how sino-german relations could develop after the controversial meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama - tibet 's spiritual leader - at the chancellery on sunday , sept .
23 . dw-world.de : china cancelled two meetings with germany - one was a justice conference in munich , another was a traditional breakfast meeting between china 's and germany 's foreign ministers on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york .
now china is saying the foreign ministers should meet after all .

china wants to make clear on a diplomatic level that the dalai lama meeting was not acceptable , but german diplomats have also tried to show to their chinese counterparts that this should not be the end of the dialogue and that we should get back to business as usual .
after all , this meeting -lsb- between merkel and the dalai lama -rsb- is not a core issue of german-chinese relations and should not be treated as such . was merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama a mistake ? the meeting was perfectly okay , but the place makes a difference .
it 's the first time the german chancellor has received the dalai lama at the chancellery itself , and that gives political clout to someone who certainly is n't a friend of the chinese government . it makes this visit , even though it 's been declared private , very political . it was a mistake in that it does not help german-chinese relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 25.09.2007 transrapid train hits the fast track in munich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's finance minister said he thinks funding could dry up before all the track is laid funding has been approved for a controversial high-speed train to run between munich and its airport .
but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .
24 .
the transrapid will hover on a track above the ground and will travel at speeds up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour .
the 37-kilometer -lrb- 23-mile -rrb- route is scheduled to be completed by 2014 .
technology made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's " parting gift " the project is seen by critics as a " parting gift " for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
after 14 in power , stoiber will step down next month .
stoiber denied that the transrapid was being done as a personal favor , saying tuesday that the project was the " guiding light for high technology made in germany . "
german engineering giants siemens and thyssenkrupp developed the project .
so far , the technology has not been broadly adopted due to safety concerns .
in september 2006 , 23 people died and 11 were injured when a transrapid crashed into a maintenance vehicle during a test run near the western german city of osnabrück .
currently only china has an operational transrapid track .
it runs between shanghai and the city 's airport .
government warns of cost overruns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only operational transrapid is in shanghai as part of the deal , the german government will pay no more than 925 million euros for the magnetic levitation train and has stipulated it will not be responsible for cost overruns .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .
the city of munich is also unhappy about the tranrapid .
munich 's socialist mayor , christian ude , said he will fight in court against the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accident last year killed 23 people " naturally , the regional capital of munich will initiate legal measures against the plan 's official approval , " ude was quoted as saying by reuters news agency .
while this week 's financial agreement was an important step , cdu expert steffen kampeter said it does n't mean the project will get a green light in the end .
the recent agreement brought the project " nearer to being financially viable , " kampeter told the dpa news agency tuesday in berlin .
" the devil is in the details , " he said .
stoiber said he was confident the project would go forward despite ongoing opposition .
" nobody will reverse this step , " he said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 25.09.2007 diplomacy needed after dalai lama visit in germany , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sino-german relations are shaky after chancellor merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama china has again criticized german chancellor for her meeting with the dalai lama over the weekend .
on tuesday , china said it had damaged ties between the two countries and called on berlin to remedy the situation . dw-world.de spoke with china expert eberhard sandschneider of the german council on foreign relations in berlin about how sino-german relations could develop after the controversial meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama - tibet 's spiritual leader - at the chancellery on sunday , sept .
23 . dw-world.de : china cancelled two meetings with germany - one was a justice conference in munich , another was a traditional breakfast meeting between china 's and germany 's foreign ministers on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york .
now china is saying the foreign ministers should meet after all .
what 's all the somersaulting about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china expert eberhard sandschneider eberhard sandschneider : obviously , the meeting between chancellor merkel and the dalai lama has angered china and will do so for some time .
but , it 's certainly not in germany 's interest , nor in china 's , to see a downturn in bilateral relations .
china wants to make clear on a diplomatic level that the dalai lama meeting was not acceptable , but german diplomats have also tried to show to their chinese counterparts that this should not be the end of the dialogue and that we should get back to business as usual .
after all , this meeting -lsb- between merkel and the dalai lama -rsb- is not a core issue of german-chinese relations and should not be treated as such . was merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama a mistake ? the meeting was perfectly okay , but the place makes a difference .
it 's the first time the german chancellor has received the dalai lama at the chancellery itself , and that gives political clout to someone who certainly is n't a friend of the chinese government . it makes this visit , even though it 's been declared private , very political . it was a mistake in that it does not help german-chinese relations .
let me give you one example .
we are all watching what is going on in burma right now .
it would be absolutely helpful and necessary for german foreign minister steinmeier to pick up the phone and call his chinese counterpart to express interest in finding a solution in burma ; for the time being , that is not possible . what are other examples of where good sino-german relations are important ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was on friendly terms with chinese premier wen jiabao -lrb- r -rrb- during an august visit in beijing basically , all major aspects of international relations .
we know that it is not possible to solve any of these problems without china - be it climate change , iran , energy supply or north korea .
if one assumes that it is in our interest to have china cooperate , then it would make sense not to prevent cooperative behavior on the part of beijing .
it 's partly economic influence , but it 's far more .
china is an important strategic partner for all the major issues on the international agenda , and also from a german perspective . still , is n't china actually interfering in germany 's affairs when it dictates with whom the chancellor should or should not meet ? theoretically , yes , it 's germany 's business , and i 'm not saying she should n't have met the dalai lama at all , but that is the game of playing interest against interest .
it is in the interest of our chancellor or even of the german government to be in dialogue with the dalai lama .
on the other hand , china has other interests , and whenever you have clashes of this kind , then a little more diplomacy is needed not to irritate bilateral relations .
it is not about dictating to each other what they should do , but about respecting each other , and only if you respect these differences can you work together in a more or less coordinated way . what are china 's interests in having good relations with germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke with students of the german-chinese law institute in nanjing in august we are one of its main trading partners - certainly the most important european trading partner .
china is interested in german technology and doing business with germany .
but , it also knows that whenever it comes to international coordination , europe is important and germany is important within europe , so there is a mutual interest in getting these things in order as soon as possible . you mentioned burma , what could china be doing to help ease the tensions there ? china is the only international actor who has some kind of pull with the junta in burma .
no other countries do .
china 's interests are clear : it cooperates both economically and militarily with burma .
so , it is in china 's interests to maintain stability there .
the chinese government certainly does not care whether it is a military leadership in burma or not , just as it does n't care about military regimes in africa .
but stability in the region is critical to china , and chinese representatives have made clear that they want the burmese military leaders to talk with the demonstrators and not shoot at them .
it remains to be seen whether or not china will take action . interview : louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 25.09.2007 german anti-terror measures fight for life as opposition grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble has proposed many of the anti-terror measures under debate germany 's interior and defense ministries have been busy rolling out potential anti-terror measures over the past weeks .
but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "
biometrics up and running despite opposition in another move to increase security , germany will start adding fingerprints to its biometric passports from nov .

the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fingerprints will be added to the biometric passports opponents of the biometric system and a proposed biometric database accuse the federal and state governments of establishing the systems despite the public 's privacy and security concerns and with little open debate . meanwhile , supporters say biometric passports create an unrivaled level of security and protection against the counterfeit identification papers often used by terrorists and other criminals .
" many germans see the benefits of this increased security and accept the collection of data , " hofmann said .
" people have got used to this as part of life .
some , however , see this as part of the creation of a global surveillance structure where everybody 's whereabouts are known .

members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data protection is an integral part of civil liberties public opposition to the plan took to the streets over the weekend when some 8,000 protestors marched through berlin in a demonstration against the use of spyware , the increase of surveillance cameras in public areas and other security proposals .
" the overall direction of the anti-terror measures is very unhealthy , " a spokesman for amnesty international 's german branch said .
" while protecting the citizens of the country , a government must make sure civil rights controls remain strict .
privacy should then be as important as protection .
we watch to see if the responses are proportionate to the threat , and it clear in most of these proposals that this is not the case . "
germans wary of surveillance supporters of the new anti-terror measures may end up facing renewed opposition to their proposals , hofmann added . " i was not surprised by the recent public opposition to extra surveillance , " he said .
" the german government is uncomfortable with large-scale public opposition .
it wo n't want to be seen going against the people , especially on an issue which stirs debate on a surveillance or police state .
germany 's historical experience with this makes it a very touchy subject . "
germans of the past lived first under the oppressive police state created by the nazis and then , for those living in east germany after world war ii , under communist state control .
unsurprisingly , today 's germans oppose increased powers which echo the policies of those times .
but the majority of the german population sees no problem with the introduction of online investigations .
some 58 percent of those polled in favour , while 36 percent rejected the searching of private computers , according to a recent infratest survey .
if germany did allow online investigations into hard drives , it would become the first eu country to do so .
deadly force debate shot out of the sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung said he 'd order passenger planes to shoot if necessary in the wake of the foiled attacks in germany , another discussion thought to have been concluded sprang to life again when defense minister franz josef jung told germany 's focus magazine that he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
in 2006 , the court , germany 's highest , scrapped the controversial law allowing hijacked civilian planes to be shot down .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on a passenger 's rights to life and human dignity .
merkel anger ends discussion again the coalition government was split down party lines .
spd leader kurt beck called jung 's behavior " disgraceful . "
left party politician petra pau accused the minister of " playing god , " and the free-market liberal fdp 's burkhard hirsch said he was shocked that jung would " disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was reportedly furious with jung this time , however , chancellor merkel seems to have had the last word .
she was described as being " furious " about jung 's statement and made it clear , at least on an official level , the debate was closed .
" the ruling of the federal constitutional court against shooting down hijacked passenger planes makes jung 's statement that he would order it a moot point , he just would n't be able to do it , " hofmann said .
" the debate has run its course .
the court has ruled against it .
plus chancellor merkel moved quickly when the topic resurfaced to reprimand jung and nip things in the bud .
i do n't predict this measure being approved any time soon . "
biometrics up and running despite opposition in another move to increase security , germany will start adding fingerprints to its biometric passports from nov .

" many germans see the benefits of this increased security and accept the collection of data , " hofmann said .

but experts believe government infighting and public opposition may kill off many of them . another day , another anti-terror plan .
two weeks after the foiling of what could have been the country 's most devastating terrorist attacks , german politicians have presented a burgeoning list of counter-terrorism measures they hope will protect germany and its citizens . at present , germany is in the process of debating , among other anti-terror issues , the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies , increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of its citizens ' biometric data . interior minister champions online searches the use of spy software resurfaced as a potential anti-terror measure just days before the alleged attacks on targets in germany were foiled .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble , long a proponent of the online searches , announced his plans to send e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say schäuble 's plans resemble methods used by the stasi , the east german secret police once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place .
german politicians showed that they were divided largely along party lines on the issue .
members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tend to be in favor schäuble 's plans , while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel shares power , are inclined to reject them as an intrusion of privacy and an infringement of personal freedoms . spyware plan 's survival depends on focus whether online searches are written into german law will largely depend on how politicians propose to use them , according to jörg hofmann , a german security analyst and author of a number of books on the threat of terrorism .
" this debate will continue on a political level as long as the emphasis remains on terrorism , " hofmann said .
" however , once the debate spreads to include other online surveillance plans , then any possible agreement on the use of spy software would be severely undermined by increasing fears of widespread , non-terror-related use . "

24 .
she spoke at an unprecedented one-day united nations climate conference in new york . germany 's chancellor repeated her call for global solutions to cutting co2 emissions , encouraging countries to begin looking for a way to move forward efforts to combat climate change .
negotiating a successor to the kyoto protocol - a treaty which sets targets for industrial nations to reduce carbon emissions - is of crucial importance , merkel said , speaking before a un climate conference .
" it 's not only the dry facts and numbers that call us to negotiate , but also the question of in what future we want to live , " she said .
" for me , this is not only an economic imperative , but also a moral one . "
merkel called for global co2 emissions , a major man-made factor that contributes to global warming , to be halved by 2050 .
carbon trading suggested as a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the un to take the lead on combating climate change merkel suggested that a global carbon-trading scheme , which places a price on industries ' carbon-dioxide emissions , should play a " central role " in plans to fight global warming .
" only when greenhouse gases have a price will climate friendly technologies really become economically attractive , " she said .
her comments were echoed by others , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in 2005 , the european union introduced the world 's largest carbon trading scheme .
the plan has not worked as expected , since some countries gave their polluters large numbers of carbon credits .
yet europe still feels carbon trading is the way forward .
" our ultimate success will depend on developing the carbon market , " barroso said at the un climate conference monday .
looking beyond the kyoto protocol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean fuel is a necessity the eu has agreed to reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , but both merkel and barroso said that figure could be raised to 30 percent if a binding international deal included other regions .
" industrialized countries must play a pioneering role here , " merkel said .
" they have to set themselves ambitious reduction targets .
they have to demonstrate how they intend to achieve these targets . "
french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major polluters to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2050 .
he advocated the use of nuclear energy , france 's main power source , as a possible solution .
" it is not a question of choice between growth and protecting our world , " sarkozy said .
" we need clean growth .
a new economy must be invented . "
un secretary general ban ki-moon said monday 's conference achieved its goal of building momentum ahead of a critical december meeting in bali , indonesia .
there , negotiators will begin talks to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" this event has sent a powerful signal to the world ... that there is a will and determination at the highest level to break with the past and act decisively , " ban said .
the us called on to take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man of action while california governor arnold schwarzenegger did address the conference , calling for " action , action , action , " on climate change , united states president george w. bush was conspicuously absent .

she spoke at an unprecedented one-day united nations climate conference in new york . germany 's chancellor repeated her call for global solutions to cutting co2 emissions , encouraging countries to begin looking for a way to move forward efforts to combat climate change .
negotiating a successor to the kyoto protocol - a treaty which sets targets for industrial nations to reduce carbon emissions - is of crucial importance , merkel said , speaking before a un climate conference .
" it 's not only the dry facts and numbers that call us to negotiate , but also the question of in what future we want to live , " she said .
" for me , this is not only an economic imperative , but also a moral one . "

carbon trading suggested as a solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the un to take the lead on combating climate change merkel suggested that a global carbon-trading scheme , which places a price on industries ' carbon-dioxide emissions , should play a " central role " in plans to fight global warming .
" only when greenhouse gases have a price will climate friendly technologies really become economically attractive , " she said .
her comments were echoed by others , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in 2005 , the european union introduced the world 's largest carbon trading scheme .
the plan has not worked as expected , since some countries gave their polluters large numbers of carbon credits .

" industrialized countries must play a pioneering role here , " merkel said .
" they have to set themselves ambitious reduction targets .
they have to demonstrate how they intend to achieve these targets . "
french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major polluters to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2050 .
he advocated the use of nuclear energy , france 's main power source , as a possible solution .
" it is not a question of choice between growth and protecting our world , " sarkozy said .
" we need clean growth .
a new economy must be invented . "
un secretary general ban ki-moon said monday 's conference achieved its goal of building momentum ahead of a critical december meeting in bali , indonesia .
there , negotiators will begin talks to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .

an expected 55,000 will be singing for the german team in tianjin , a similar number to those chinese who turned out to watch all of germany 's matches so far .
" there always seems to be more chinese support at our games than at any of the other games in which the chinese are n't playing , " said german goalkeeper nadine angerer .
" it 's pretty clear that german soccer is liked here very much . "
every self-respecting chinese fan knows about the careers of legends such as germany 's most-capped player lothar matthäus and " kaiser " franz beckenbauer but since the women 's team arrived to begin their title defense in china , the locals have found a new team of teutonic idols .
with 16 goals so far in this tournament , the high-scoring germans tick all the right boxes for chinese fans brought up on fast action and avalanches of goals .
" the chinese want to see attack after attack , " said german klaus schlappner who coached china 's men 's team from 1992 to 1995 .
china 's support hits heights against japan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's win over japan pleased the chinese fans while the chinese fans followed germany 's displays against argentina and england with appreciation , true fandom hit when the germans eliminated local rivals japan from the championship .
with rolling chants of " deguo , deguo " - " germany , germany " - the chinese added their voice to the german fans ' and celebrated just as wildly as their arch-rivals were sent packing .
the fanaticism is n't just restricted to the stadiums either .
everywhere the german squad goes , a legion of chinese fans follows .
easily spotted in their team leisurewear in shops and cafes , the german players are besieged for photographs and mementos .
" about 99 percent want the autograph of birgit prinz , " smiled defender ariane hingst .
germany 's star woman , a three-time world player of the year , is a megastar in soccer-crazy asia and the announcement of her name before matches causes a frenzy in the crowd .
" i had no idea that they knew me over here , " prinz said .
communism beats popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's fans favored north korea against germany despite the adoration , there are some things that do take precedence over popularity .
when germany were 3-0 up and cruising against north korea on saturday , chinese voices were leant in support to their beleaguered communist sisters .
no-one felt betrayed .
" if the spectators support us , it is great fun , " said german midfielder simone laudehr .
" if they shout for the others , then that 's only more motivation for us . "
the loyalty of the chinese fans to germany is unlikely to come into question on wednesday when norway , narrow 1-0 winners over the hosts , will feel the heat of the locals after what was seen to be a lucky quarter-final win .
the noise is expected to be only marginally less than if the chinese were meeting germany themselves for a place in the world cup final .
norway stands between holders and final germany will be looking to feed off whatever support they can get .
while they have only really struggled once in the tournament so far , laboring to a 0-0 draw with england , the norwegians are tough customers who are far from unknown to the world champions .
the germans and norwegians have faced off 28 times in the past , with 12 going germany 's way , 11 to norway and five draws .
" norway always belongs among the top nations , " said prinz .
" it will be the same here .
we can say from intense experience that we expect nothing less . "

he also called for more openness on this sensitive issue . the bishop of fulda , heinz josef algermissen , said his colleague bishop gerhard ludwig müller of regensburg made a mistake in offering a second chance to a priest with a history of pedophilia .
" if something has happened in the past with children , a new start should only be allowed at a distance from children , " algermissen told the bayern2 radio station .
the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .
müller reassigned the priest to the parish of riekofen , a village near regensburg , after that sentence expired .
police then arrested 39-year-old peter k. on aug .

" there 's nothing worse for a bishop than a man of the cloth abusing people 's trust , " algermissen said .
" something like this is a true blow , and in view of what happened , you can feel half-sick . "
müller has justified his decision to reassign peter k. by saying he was guided by psychological evaluations showing that the priest did not have a pedophile fixation .
müller denies responsibility for any grotesque lapses in judgment .
" even a bishop ca n't rule out the possibility of a priest misusing the freedom -lsb- of his position -rsb- , " müller said in an interview with the catholic news agency kna .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women 's soccer -pipe- 25.09.2007 chinese fans put the red into germany 's red , black and gold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer captain birgit prinz is a big star in china where her team has huge support their team might have been knocked out of the women 's world cup , but china 's fans wo n't be sitting at home moping .
after the hosts were eliminated by norway , germany will feel the full force of china 's support . germany 's women 's soccer team will have the support of the people 's republic as they take on the hosts ' victors norway in the first semi-final on wednesday , sept .
26 .
before people start accusing the chinese of rallying against their conquerors out of sour grapes , it must be pointed out that whenever china has n't been playing , the local fans have been cheering germany on in astounding numbers .
an expected 55,000 will be singing for the german team in tianjin , a similar number to those chinese who turned out to watch all of germany 's matches so far .
" there always seems to be more chinese support at our games than at any of the other games in which the chinese are n't playing , " said german goalkeeper nadine angerer .
" it 's pretty clear that german soccer is liked here very much . "
every self-respecting chinese fan knows about the careers of legends such as germany 's most-capped player lothar matthäus and " kaiser " franz beckenbauer but since the women 's team arrived to begin their title defense in china , the locals have found a new team of teutonic idols .
with 16 goals so far in this tournament , the high-scoring germans tick all the right boxes for chinese fans brought up on fast action and avalanches of goals .
" the chinese want to see attack after attack , " said german klaus schlappner who coached china 's men 's team from 1992 to 1995 .
china 's support hits heights against japan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's win over japan pleased the chinese fans while the chinese fans followed germany 's displays against argentina and england with appreciation , true fandom hit when the germans eliminated local rivals japan from the championship .
with rolling chants of " deguo , deguo " - " germany , germany " - the chinese added their voice to the german fans ' and celebrated just as wildly as their arch-rivals were sent packing .
the fanaticism is n't just restricted to the stadiums either .
everywhere the german squad goes , a legion of chinese fans follows .
easily spotted in their team leisurewear in shops and cafes , the german players are besieged for photographs and mementos .
" about 99 percent want the autograph of birgit prinz , " smiled defender ariane hingst .
germany 's star woman , a three-time world player of the year , is a megastar in soccer-crazy asia and the announcement of her name before matches causes a frenzy in the crowd .
" i had no idea that they knew me over here , " prinz said .
communism beats popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's fans favored north korea against germany despite the adoration , there are some things that do take precedence over popularity .
when germany were 3-0 up and cruising against north korea on saturday , chinese voices were leant in support to their beleaguered communist sisters .
no-one felt betrayed .
" if the spectators support us , it is great fun , " said german midfielder simone laudehr .
" if they shout for the others , then that 's only more motivation for us . "
the loyalty of the chinese fans to germany is unlikely to come into question on wednesday when norway , narrow 1-0 winners over the hosts , will feel the heat of the locals after what was seen to be a lucky quarter-final win .
the noise is expected to be only marginally less than if the chinese were meeting germany themselves for a place in the world cup final .

when the countries joined the bloc in 2004 , the eu set aside 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to help the countries catch up with their wealthier counterparts .
the funds were meant to pay for new schools , roads and promote job training .
money not being used bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grybauskaite said countries are set to lose but the money needs to be spent by the end of 2007 , grybauskaite said .
with only three months left to go , the countries have used only 57 percent of their structural funds on average and just 22 percent of their cohesion funds , according to figures provided by grybauskaite at a news conference .
the countries were cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
it is unlikely that they will get a second shot at spending the money .
" do n't dream about an endless possibility to absorb these funds , " grybauskaite warned .
" absorption levels are not satisfactory and time is running out . "
eu : no excuse for unspent money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries do n't have much time left to spend their eu aid money poland had done the worst job of spending its allocated money .
grybauskaite said the responsibility to allocate the money efficiently and quickly rested completely with the national governments .
" do n't look for excuses , because there will be no excuses .
if poland is n't able -lsb- to spend the money -rsb- , then poland loses out , " grybauskaite , a lithuanian , said at the press conference .
in 2006 , europe 's 25 member states -lsb- bulgaria and romania joined in 2007 -rsb- spent 91 percent of the eu 's 106.6 billion euro budget , according to official figures .
france led the way in raking in eu dollars , landing 13.5 billion euros in 2006 , of which 10 billion was for agricultural funds .
greece , lithuania and malta are the biggest beneficiaries after luxembourg , when viewed in terms of eu funds as a percentage of gross national income . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

before people start accusing the chinese of rallying against their conquerors out of sour grapes , it must be pointed out that whenever china has n't been playing , the local fans have been cheering germany on in astounding numbers .
an expected 55,000 will be singing for the german team in tianjin , a similar number to those chinese who turned out to watch all of germany 's matches so far .
" there always seems to be more chinese support at our games than at any of the other games in which the chinese are n't playing , " said german goalkeeper nadine angerer .
" it 's pretty clear that german soccer is liked here very much . "
every self-respecting chinese fan knows about the careers of legends such as germany 's most-capped player lothar matthäus and " kaiser " franz beckenbauer but since the women 's team arrived to begin their title defense in china , the locals have found a new team of teutonic idols .
with 16 goals so far in this tournament , the high-scoring germans tick all the right boxes for chinese fans brought up on fast action and avalanches of goals .

communism beats popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's fans favored north korea against germany despite the adoration , there are some things that do take precedence over popularity .
when germany were 3-0 up and cruising against north korea on saturday , chinese voices were leant in support to their beleaguered communist sisters .
no-one felt betrayed .
" if the spectators support us , it is great fun , " said german midfielder simone laudehr .
" if they shout for the others , then that 's only more motivation for us . "
the loyalty of the chinese fans to germany is unlikely to come into question on wednesday when norway , narrow 1-0 winners over the hosts , will feel the heat of the locals after what was seen to be a lucky quarter-final win .
the noise is expected to be only marginally less than if the chinese were meeting germany themselves for a place in the world cup final .
norway stands between holders and final germany will be looking to feed off whatever support they can get .
while they have only really struggled once in the tournament so far , laboring to a 0-0 draw with england , the norwegians are tough customers who are far from unknown to the world champions .
the germans and norwegians have faced off 28 times in the past , with 12 going germany 's way , 11 to norway and five draws .

but critics say the project is expensive and that the deal is n't as final as its champions would like to think . the german-designed transrapid magnetic levitation train will be the first of its kind in europe and trim the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes .
but concerns remain over the project 's 1.85 billion euro -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- price tag .
money to build the transrapid will come from the european union , germany 's federal government , the bavarian government , the munich airport , germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- rail company and german companies .
the major participants reached a deal on the financing late monday , sept .
24 .
the transrapid will hover on a track above the ground and will travel at speeds up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour .
the 37-kilometer -lrb- 23-mile -rrb- route is scheduled to be completed by 2014 .
technology made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's " parting gift " the project is seen by critics as a " parting gift " for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the conservative christian social union , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
after 14 in power , stoiber will step down next month .
stoiber denied that the transrapid was being done as a personal favor , saying tuesday that the project was the " guiding light for high technology made in germany . "
german engineering giants siemens and thyssenkrupp developed the project .
so far , the technology has not been broadly adopted due to safety concerns .
in september 2006 , 23 people died and 11 were injured when a transrapid crashed into a maintenance vehicle during a test run near the western german city of osnabrück .
currently only china has an operational transrapid track .
it runs between shanghai and the city 's airport .
government warns of cost overruns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only operational transrapid is in shanghai as part of the deal , the german government will pay no more than 925 million euros for the magnetic levitation train and has stipulated it will not be responsible for cost overruns .
germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück voiced his continuing opposition to the project tuesday , saying that it will be much more expensive than originally planned .
" the project will be considerably more expensive , " the social democrat was quoted saying in the tuesday edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the costs will definitely not stay at 1.85 billion euros . "
in his former position of premier of north rhine-westphalia , steinbrück quashed a proposal to build a similar project .
the city of munich is also unhappy about the tranrapid .
munich 's socialist mayor , christian ude , said he will fight in court against the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accident last year killed 23 people " naturally , the regional capital of munich will initiate legal measures against the plan 's official approval , " ude was quoted as saying by reuters news agency .
while this week 's financial agreement was an important step , cdu expert steffen kampeter said it does n't mean the project will get a green light in the end .
the recent agreement brought the project " nearer to being financially viable , " kampeter told the dpa news agency tuesday in berlin .
" the devil is in the details , " he said .
stoiber said he was confident the project would go forward despite ongoing opposition .
" nobody will reverse this step , " he said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also called for more openness on this sensitive issue . the bishop of fulda , heinz josef algermissen , said his colleague bishop gerhard ludwig müller of regensburg made a mistake in offering a second chance to a priest with a history of pedophilia .
" if something has happened in the past with children , a new start should only be allowed at a distance from children , " algermissen told the bayern2 radio station .
the priest in question , identified only as peter k. , was found guilty in 2000 of making improper sexual advances toward a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence .
müller reassigned the priest to the parish of riekofen , a village near regensburg , after that sentence expired .
police then arrested 39-year-old peter k. on aug .
30 for suspected sexual offences committed between 2003 and 2006 , and riekofen was given a new priest .
" nothing worse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop algermissen has been critical of what happened algermissen 's criticism of his colleague was all the more noteworthy because it came on the eve of the ongoing conference of german bishops in fulda .
algermissen called for an open discussion of the riekofen affair .
" there 's nothing worse for a bishop than a man of the cloth abusing people 's trust , " algermissen said .
" something like this is a true blow , and in view of what happened , you can feel half-sick . "
müller has justified his decision to reassign peter k. by saying he was guided by psychological evaluations showing that the priest did not have a pedophile fixation .
müller denies responsibility for any grotesque lapses in judgment .
" even a bishop ca n't rule out the possibility of a priest misusing the freedom -lsb- of his position -rsb- , " müller said in an interview with the catholic news agency kna .
" priests are not marionettes .
they themselves are responsible for what they do with parishioners . " calls for bishop 's resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican is not getting involved at the moment but others remain outraged and were calling for müller to step down .
in a press conference , the head of a german initiative representing victims of abuse by priests , johannes heibel , said müller 's decision to reassign peter k. was " more than scandalous . "
german psychoanalyst micha hilgers concurred , telling the dpa news agency that assigning peter k. to riekofen was " completely irresponsible . "
" it 's practically bizarre to put him in close proximity again to the situation in which he committed a crime , " hilgers added .
" therapy is possible , but a cure is not . "
recurring problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop müller said priests are responsible for their own behavior long a topic shrouded by secrecy , cases of pederasty among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not got involved in the riekofen affair .
" it 's a german matter , " dpa news agency quoted a source within radio vatican as saying .
" the bishop will have to justify his behavior to his fellow bishops . " in 2002 , the german bishops acted to head off such a crisis , with the conference of bishops issuing guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . müller has denied breaching the guideline , saying he had a christian duty to forgive and had been convinced that the paedophile priest had reformed his ways . but hilgers and others worry the priesthood may inherently attract people susceptible to pederasty and say the church needs to be more proactive about preventing cases like the one in riekofen .
" the bishop and the bishopric have a duty to keep an especially keen eye out for things like this , " hilgers told dpa .
" they should be conscious of the special risk .
that has been criminally neglected . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

imam samudra and mukhlas , or ali gufron , sought to overturn a decision that they be executed by firing squad .
a court official said the men had provided no new evidence to challenge earlier verdicts .
an appeal by a third man , amrozi , has already been rejected .
more than 200 people died in the bali nightclub bombings on 12 october 2002 .
more than 30 people have been jailed for the attack , which was blamed on the south east asian militant group jemaah islamiah .
key figures the three men were sentenced to death in 2003 .
they were convicted under anti-terror laws that came in after the bali attacks , and their lawyers had argued that they were found guilty on the basis of retroactive legislation .
but supreme court spokesman nurhadi told journalists that judges had ruled against mukhlas and imam samudra on 23 august and 19 september respectively .
an appeal by mukhlas ' younger brother , amrozi , was rejected earlier this month .
the three could now make a plea for clemency to indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono , but they have said they will not do this .
amrozi , mukhlas and imam samudra were found guilty of major roles in the attacks - and all three have already confessed to their involvement .
amrozi , dubbed the " smiling bomber " for his lack of remorse , was found guilty of helping plan and carry out the attacks .
mukhlas was seen as the mastermind behind the attacks , while imam samudra was described by police as the " field commander " .
no date has been set for the death sentences to be carried out .

imam samudra and mukhlas , or ali gufron , sought to overturn a decision that they be executed by firing squad .
a court official said the men had provided no new evidence to challenge earlier verdicts .
an appeal by a third man , amrozi , has already been rejected .
more than 200 people died in the bali nightclub bombings on 12 october 2002 .
more than 30 people have been jailed for the attack , which was blamed on the south east asian militant group jemaah islamiah .
key figures the three men were sentenced to death in 2003 .
they were convicted under anti-terror laws that came in after the bali attacks , and their lawyers had argued that they were found guilty on the basis of retroactive legislation .
amrozi is known as the ' smiling bomber ' but supreme court spokesman nurhadi told journalists that judges had ruled against mukhlas and imam samudra on 23 august and 19 september respectively .
an appeal by mukhlas ' younger brother , amrozi , was rejected earlier this month .
the three could now make a plea for clemency to indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono , but they have said they will not do this .
amrozi , mukhlas and imam samudra were found guilty of major roles in the attacks - and all three have already confessed to their involvement .
amrozi , dubbed the " smiling bomber " for his lack of remorse , was found guilty of helping plan and carry out the attacks .
mukhlas was seen as the mastermind behind the attacks , while imam samudra was described by police as the " field commander " .
no date has been set for the death sentences to be carried out .

"
the prime minister said he was a " conviction politician " who wanted to " defend and extend " british values and help everyone reach their potential .
the build up to his speech was dominated by continued speculation over whether he will call a snap election .
mr brown , who did not mention any election in his speech , has so far refused to rule out an autumn poll .
my answer to crime and disorder - our policy - is to both punish and prevent gordon brown speech in full reaction to brown speech in a bbc interview ahead of his speech he said he was " getting on with the job " of implementing labour 's manifesto from 2005 , adding : " do i need to call an election to do so ?
no . "
mr brown began his speech by talking about some of the challenges he has faced since coming to power , from the failed terror attacks in london and glasgow to foot-and-mouth .
" britain has been tested and not found wanting .
this is who we are , " said mr brown , who had received a standing ovation as he arrived in the hall .
british jobs mr brown said he was a " conviction politician " who stood for a " britain where we all have obligations to each other and by fulfilling them , everyone has a chance to make the most of themselves " .
but there was no mention of conservative leader david cameron or lib dem leader sir menzies campbell - and none of the political knockabout or jibes at opponents normally found in party conference speeches .
in his manifesto he promised a referendum on the eu constitution , but he has broken that promise mark francois shadow europe minister eco-town target raised brown 's nhs experience there were few jokes , with mr brown admitting : " sometimes people say i am too serious and i fight too hard and maybe that 's true . "
instead he spoke of his own life-changing experience of the nhs - when he almost lost his sight after a rugby accident - and the education system .
his " pledge to the british people " was " i will not let you down .
i will stand up for our schools and hospitals , i will stand up for british values .
i will stand up for a strong britain and i will always stand up for you " .
he also praised the strength and stability of the british economy , which he said helped it weather a " recent wave of financial turbulence " - his only reference to the northern rock banking crisis .
he pledged to push for full employment and repeated his promise to create " british jobs for british workers " .
on housing , which mr brown has said is a top priority , he said he wanted two million more home owners by 2010 , compared to 1997 .
he said the government would build ten new " eco-towns " - double the original number announced earlier this year .
treated with respect on law and order , mr brown said " my answer to crime and disorder - our policy - is to both punish and prevent " .
he announced an extension of stop and search and dispersal powers to tackle the rise in gun crime .
he also said public services had to be more personalised , saying people needed to be treated " not as a number , but with respect " .
he also confirmed plans for a deep-clean of hospitals over christmas and the new year in the fight against the mrsa bug .
mr brown also pledged to : " do our duty and discharge obligations " in afghanistan and iraq by working towards three objectives " security , political reconciliation and economic reconstruction " .
fight for " justice " for the people of darfur .
extend breast cancer screening to cover 47 to 73-year-olds create a " personal health service " with greater access to gps and a personal health check for every adult double the number of hospital matrons to 5,000 and give them the power to sack contract cleaners , who did not " meet the highest standards of cleanliness " .
mr brown who became prime minister by succeeding tony blair as labour leader , had earlier said his policy plans included reviewing some past labour initiatives - such as 24 hour licensing and reclassification of cannabis - if he felt they needed reform .
on binge drinking , particularly among teenagers , he said it was important not to send out the wrong message .
opinion polls he told the bournemouth conference that , while great advances were made under tony blair - to whom he paid tribute along with neil kinnock - change was required to meet new challenges .
this was a speech designed to sell brown 's story , values and policies bbc political editor nick robinson read nick 's thoughts in full he had earlier said , in a letter to the party 's ruling executive , that he wanted labour to set ambitious long-term goals and then stay the course to meet the challenges of the decade ahead " .
much of the speculation about an early poll - mr brown can wait until may 2010 if he wants before holding an election - has been prompted by recent opinion polls giving labour a lead .
and on the first day of the bournemouth conference a poll in the sun suggests the tories are eight points behind labour .

the poll , carried out by ipsos-mori on september 20-22 , suggested 34 % of those questioned favoured the conservatives , with 14 % for the lib dems .
the party is also advertising for 22 jobs - including graphic designers , policy and research officers , campaign assistants and press officers , suggesting it is gearing up for an election campaign .
mr brown 's claim to be acting on labour 's last manifesto was not true , said the shadow europe minister mark francois .
he said : " in his manifesto he promised a referendum on the eu constitution , but he has broken that promise .

"
the prime minister said he was a " conviction politician " who wanted to " defend and extend " british values and help everyone reach their potential .
the build up to his speech was dominated by continued speculation over whether he will call a snap election .
mr brown , who did not mention any election in his speech , has so far refused to rule out an autumn poll . "
my answer to crime and disorder - our policy - is to both punish and prevent " gordon brown speech in full reaction to brown speech in a bbc interview ahead of his speech he said he was " getting on with the job " of implementing labour 's manifesto from 2005 , adding : " do i need to call an election to do so ?
no . "
mr brown began his speech by talking about some of the challenges he has faced since coming to power , from the failed terror attacks in london and glasgow to foot-and-mouth .
" britain has been tested and not found wanting .
this is who we are , " said mr brown , who had received a standing ovation as he arrived in the hall .
british jobs mr brown said he was a " conviction politician " who stood for a " britain where we all have obligations to each other and by fulfilling them , everyone has a chance to make the most of themselves " .
but there was no mention of conservative leader david cameron or lib dem leader sir menzies campbell - and none of the political knockabout or jibes at opponents normally found in party conference speeches . "
in his manifesto he promised a referendum on the eu constitution , but he has broken that promise " mark francois shadow europe minister eco-town target raised brown 's nhs experience there were few jokes , with mr brown admitting : " sometimes people say i am too serious and i fight too hard and maybe that 's true . "
instead he spoke of his own life-changing experience of the nhs - when he almost lost his sight after a rugby accident - and the education system .
his " pledge to the british people " was " i will not let you down .
i will stand up for our schools and hospitals , i will stand up for british values .
i will stand up for a strong britain and i will always stand up for you " .
he also praised the strength and stability of the british economy , which he said helped it weather a " recent wave of financial turbulence " - his only reference to the northern rock banking crisis .
he pledged to push for full employment and repeated his promise to create " british jobs for british workers " .
on housing , which mr brown has said is a top priority , he said he wanted two million more home owners by 2010 , compared to 1997 .
he said the government would build ten new " eco-towns " - double the original number announced earlier this year .
treated with respect on law and order , mr brown said " my answer to crime and disorder - our policy - is to both punish and prevent " .
he announced an extension of stop and search and dispersal powers to tackle the rise in gun crime .
he also said public services had to be more personalised , saying people needed to be treated " not as a number , but with respect " .
he also confirmed plans for a deep-clean of hospitals over christmas and the new year in the fight against the mrsa bug .
mr brown also pledged to : " do our duty and discharge obligations " in afghanistan and iraq by working towards three objectives " security , political reconciliation and economic reconstruction " .
fight for " justice " for the people of darfur .
extend breast cancer screening to cover 47 to 73-year-olds create a " personal health service " with greater access to gps and a personal health check for every adult double the number of hospital matrons to 5,000 and give them the power to sack contract cleaners , who did not " meet the highest standards of cleanliness " .
mr brown who became prime minister by succeeding tony blair as labour leader , had earlier said his policy plans included reviewing some past labour initiatives - such as 24 hour licensing and reclassification of cannabis - if he felt they needed reform .
on binge drinking , particularly among teenagers , he said it was important not to send out the wrong message .
opinion polls he told the bournemouth conference that , while great advances were made under tony blair - to whom he paid tribute along with neil kinnock - change was required to meet new challenges . "
this was a speech designed to sell brown 's story , values and policies " bbc political editor nick robinson he had earlier said , in a letter to the party 's ruling executive , that he wanted labour to set ambitious long-term goals and then stay the course to meet the challenges of the decade ahead " .
much of the speculation about an early poll - mr brown can wait until may 2010 if he wants before holding an election - has been prompted by recent opinion polls giving labour a lead .
and on the first day of the bournemouth conference a poll in the sun suggests the tories are eight points behind labour .

mr browne , in bournemouth for the labour conference , visited bovington armour centre , dorset , where 300 bed spaces have been created since 2005 .
he said : " the nation owes our servicemen and women a huge debt of gratitude for the hard work they do on our behalf .
" a crucial part of this is the welfare package we give our personnel and central to this is providing good quality accommodation . "

" this new money offers an excellent opportunity to make a real difference to our servicemen and women and underlines the priority we place on this issue . "
the improved living conditions are hoped to help recruit and retain service personnel .
a national audit office report in march said a significant number of personnel could be living in poor quality accommodation for the next 20 years or more .

eluned morgan made the call at a fringe meeting at the labour conference while beside the policy 's architect , first minister rhodri morgan .
she said the assembly election showed it was not enough to win key marginals and urged labour to look past its core vote and appeal to the middle ground .
mr morgan said labour had suffered dips in support before and recovered .
the idea of ditching the strategy has also been suggested in an internal report presented to members of the party 's welsh executive .
the mep told the meeting welsh labour needed to consider three issues after the assembly election result , which left labour with 26 out of 60 seats and forced it to seek a power-sharing coalition with plaid cymru .
ms morgan said labour had to examine the rise in the conservative vote , the collapse in support in rural and welsh-speaking areas and the increase in backing for the liberal democrats .
rhodri morgan said labour had recovered from dips in support she told bbc radio wales the assembly election had shown the " writing was on the wall , " with a greater swing to the tories in wales than the rest of the country .
she said the party had to look at the way society had changed and to understand the different issues that appealed to people .
she said : " what 's clear is that we need to change our message , change the way we 're speaking and who we 're speaking to .
" i think what we 've been doing in the past is concentrating , quite rightly , on the core labour vote , that we know in the past has come out to support us .
" but that is not enough .
we need to have much broader appeal than that if we are to win back those tory marginal seats . "
she said she was not proposing a carbon copy of what prime minister gordon brown was delivering for england and the rest of the uk .
she said : " not at all - i think we can still do a ' made in wales ' version of what is necessary for ' middle wales ' , if you want . "
' unionist beliefs ' former welsh secretary paul murphy told the same conference meeting that labour should resist the possibility of " an obsession with identity in wales " .
welsh assembly government counsel general and leader of the house carwyn jones said labour should proclaim its unionist beliefs more .
former first secretary alun michael said the assembly should be increased to 80 members , with two per constituency , and no regional list ams .
he also suggested a northern ireland-style power-sharing deal in which all parties would share responsibility for making devolution work .
nick bourne , leader of the conservatives in the assembly , responded to the mep 's comments by saying : " this is the clearest indication yet that rhodri morgan 's ' clear red water ' project is dead .
" his own colleagues are rejecting it because they know it is unworkable , rigid , outdated dogma which has held wales back for far too long . "
