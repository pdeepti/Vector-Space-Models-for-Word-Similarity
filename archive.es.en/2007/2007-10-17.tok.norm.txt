17 , allows the government to order cross-border operations in order to deal with an estimated 3,500 rebels from the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- that are based in mountainous northern iraq . prime minister tayyip erdogan has played down expectations of an imminent offensive , but the parliamentary approval provides the legal basis for nato 's second biggest army to cross the border as and when it sees fit for one year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on iraq tuesday to crack down on kurdish rebels after the vote , the european commission said it hoped turkey would decide to respect the territorial integrity of iraq . " it is crucial that turkey continues to tackle this problem through cooperation between the relevant authorities , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy said .
" the eu and turkey have regularly reiterated that they remain committed to the independence , sovereignty , unity and territorial integrity of iraq . " erdogan said that parliament 's decision does not mean an immediate incursion will follow . " we will act at the right time and under the right conditions , " erdogan told his ruling ak party on tuesday . recent attacks on turkey over the past few weeks , members of the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- have staged renewed attacks on targets in turkey from iraqi territory .

the turkish government estimates that there are around 3,500 kurdish rebels in northern iraq . despite the pkk 's presence , the region is relatively peaceful and the us has expressed concerns that an attack would destabilize the last calm area in iraq .
us president george w. bush said on wednesday that the us was making it clear to turkey that military action in iraq would not be in ankara 's interest . iraq prime minister nouri al-maliki said his government was determined to halt the " terrorist activities " of the pkk on iraqi territory .

turkey has threatened to withdraw its logistical support for the war in iraq , including use of a strategically important air base on turkish territory , if the measure is approved . in its quest for an ethnic homeland in southern turkey , the pkk has been active since the early 1980s .
ankara attributes more than 30,000 deaths to the group 's armed struggle . " in the past several years , turkey has conducted 24 cross-border military operations , " akin birdal , human rights activist and a member of turkey 's parliament , told the germany daily frankfurter rundschau .

16 , reiterated concerns over a european union energy market reform plan that moscow fears will hamper efforts by its gas monopolist , gazprom , to expand into europe . last month , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , proposed to disband major utility companies that control power supply , generation and transmission in a bid to boost competition and lower prices in the 27-member bloc . the commission , however , inserted a clause in the proposed legislation to bar foreign companies from controlling european pipelines and power grids unless they adhere to the same rules as eu firms and their home country has reached an agreement with officials in brussels . loophole could aim at gazprom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy is also a security concern for many countries the loophole was immediately dubbed the " gazprom clause " by commentators who argued that it was specifically aimed at the russian monopolist company .
russian energy officials have criticized the eu 's proposal as protectionism . at a press conference after talks on tuesday , however , piebalgs said a group of russian and eu analysts would review the " gazprom clause " and that khristenko had agreed to await the review before making a final political decision . " i appreciate this very pragmatic approach , " piebalgs said at the news conference . " we are interested in active consultation with our european colleagues on new energy initiatives , " khristenko said , according to reuters . early warning system on energy despite the on-going dispute , khristenko and piebalgs agreed on setting up an " energy early warning system " to help avoid problems in the supply of or demand for russian energy deliveries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not want a repeat of gas shortages from russia russia is the eu 's biggest supplier of gas , most of which reaches the bloc through the ukraine .
the eu wants to avoid a repeat of the events of late 2005 , when gazprom cut its gas supplies to ukraine in a pricing battle that led to shortages in some eu countries . a dispute between russia and belarus in december and january also affected oil supplies to some european countries . the early warning system would include a hotline for emergency situations and obliges brussels and moscow to inform each other of potential problems through designated contacts . " the eu has sufficient reserves " but piebalgs said the warning system was not a signal of looming problems .

16 , reiterated concerns over a european union energy market reform plan that moscow fears will hamper efforts by its gas monopolist , gazprom , to expand into europe . last month , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , proposed to disband major utility companies that control power supply , generation and transmission in a bid to boost competition and lower prices in the 27-member bloc . the commission , however , inserted a clause in the proposed legislation to bar foreign companies from controlling european pipelines and power grids unless they adhere to the same rules as eu firms and their home country has reached an agreement with officials in brussels . loophole could aim at gazprom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy is also a security concern for many countries the loophole was immediately dubbed the " gazprom clause " by commentators who argued that it was specifically aimed at the russian monopolist company .
russian energy officials have criticized the eu 's proposal as protectionism . at a press conference after talks on tuesday , however , piebalgs said a group of russian and eu analysts would review the " gazprom clause " and that khristenko had agreed to await the review before making a final political decision . " i appreciate this very pragmatic approach , " piebalgs said at the news conference . " we are interested in active consultation with our european colleagues on new energy initiatives , " khristenko said , according to reuters . early warning system on energy despite the on-going dispute , khristenko and piebalgs agreed on setting up an " energy early warning system " to help avoid problems in the supply of or demand for russian energy deliveries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not want a repeat of gas shortages from russia russia is the eu 's biggest supplier of gas , most of which reaches the bloc through the ukraine .
the eu wants to avoid a repeat of the events of late 2005 , when gazprom cut its gas supplies to ukraine in a pricing battle that led to shortages in some eu countries . a dispute between russia and belarus in december and january also affected oil supplies to some european countries . the early warning system would include a hotline for emergency situations and obliges brussels and moscow to inform each other of potential problems through designated contacts . " the eu has sufficient reserves " but piebalgs said the warning system was not a signal of looming problems . " i have no doubts about security of supply for this winter , " he told reporters , adding that the eu had sufficient energy reserves to cover needs in the coming months . according to reuters , he also downplayed the effect of record high oil prices on gas prices . " there is a formula related to oil prices , but it does n't mean necessarily that this follows oil price fluctuations , " he said , adding that he expected tuesday 's price spike to fall within a week . khristenko said high oil prices would not largely affect gas prices . " i do n't expect major price changes compared to the current situation , " he said . energy is expected to be a top item on the agenda at an eu-russia summit in portugal on oct .

17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says exports are a one-way street - from right to left while china is the eu 's biggest source of manufactured goods , european exports to china are of minor economic importance . the eu sold more goods to switzerland than it did to china , mandelson 's letter said , adding that the trade deficit between the eu and china was growing at about 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- every hour . " the chinese juggernaut is , to some extent , out of control , " mandelson added . beijing in need of a course correction ? separately , serge abou , the eu 's ambassador to china , said on wednesday that beijing had n't done enough to assuage european concerns on a host of issues ranging from government subsidies for domestic industry to market access barriers for european imports or the yuan 's exchange rate . " we asked the chinese government for some correction , some policy changes , and we do not see a significant answer , " abou told reporters . the ambassador singled out the steel industry , saying chinese exports to the eu had grown from around 1 million tons in 2005 to 5 million tons last year - and could hit 12 million tons this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says china has been subsidizing its steel-making industry " we have some ideas that this export of steel has been subsidized and so we will not prevent our industry from raising some complaints , " abou said .
" if they raise some complaints , we will investigate . " abou added that the eu 's ballooning trade deficit with china , which reached 130 billion euros last year , would probably grow another 20 percent to 25 percent this year . " it is certain that these facts are considered with a certain bitterness in our leadership , and that we would like a real debate on these issues , " he said . currency tensions in contrast to the us - which is locked in trade disputes with china at the world trade organization - the eu has so far been less non-confrontational about pursuing punitive measures .
instead it has regularly cautioned beijing about issues such as intellectual property rights and the value of the yuan . both the us , which also has a trade gap with china , and the eu have criticized beijing about the value of the yuan , saying the chinese currency is massively undervalued to give chinese exporters an unfair advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yuan has weakened against the euro since it was de-linked from the dollar " if china makes an effort toward the dollar and does not make an effort towards the euro , while we are the first trade partner of china , there is something wrong in the reasoning , " abou said . a level playing field needed eu finance ministers last week singled out the yuan 's inflexibility as a primary culprit behind global market imbalances and said they planned to send a delegation to beijing later this year to discuss the currency . mandelson also told the bbc that there needed to be a level playing field on trade with china . " if we want to sustain a policy of openness towards china politically , we have to make sure that the public is satisfied that that trading relationship is being conducted on full and fair trade , otherwise we are going to be in trouble , " mandelson said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , reiterated concerns over a european union energy market reform plan that moscow fears will hamper efforts by its gas monopolist , gazprom , to expand into europe . last month , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , proposed to disband major utility companies that control power supply , generation and transmission in a bid to boost competition and lower prices in the 27-member bloc . the commission , however , inserted a clause in the proposed legislation to bar foreign companies from controlling european pipelines and power grids unless they adhere to the same rules as eu firms and their home country has reached an agreement with officials in brussels . loophole could aim at gazprom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy is also a security concern for many countries the loophole was immediately dubbed the " gazprom clause " by commentators who argued that it was specifically aimed at the russian monopolist company .
russian energy officials have criticized the eu 's proposal as protectionism . at a press conference after talks on tuesday , however , piebalgs said a group of russian and eu analysts would review the " gazprom clause " and that khristenko had agreed to await the review before making a final political decision .

16 , reiterated concerns over a european union energy market reform plan that moscow fears will hamper efforts by its gas monopolist , gazprom , to expand into europe . last month , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , proposed to disband major utility companies that control power supply , generation and transmission in a bid to boost competition and lower prices in the 27-member bloc . the commission , however , inserted a clause in the proposed legislation to bar foreign companies from controlling european pipelines and power grids unless they adhere to the same rules as eu firms and their home country has reached an agreement with officials in brussels . loophole could aim at gazprom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy is also a security concern for many countries the loophole was immediately dubbed the " gazprom clause " by commentators who argued that it was specifically aimed at the russian monopolist company .
russian energy officials have criticized the eu 's proposal as protectionism . at a press conference after talks on tuesday , however , piebalgs said a group of russian and eu analysts would review the " gazprom clause " and that khristenko had agreed to await the review before making a final political decision . " i appreciate this very pragmatic approach , " piebalgs said at the news conference . " we are interested in active consultation with our european colleagues on new energy initiatives , " khristenko said , according to reuters . early warning system on energy despite the on-going dispute , khristenko and piebalgs agreed on setting up an " energy early warning system " to help avoid problems in the supply of or demand for russian energy deliveries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not want a repeat of gas shortages from russia russia is the eu 's biggest supplier of gas , most of which reaches the bloc through the ukraine .
the eu wants to avoid a repeat of the events of late 2005 , when gazprom cut its gas supplies to ukraine in a pricing battle that led to shortages in some eu countries . a dispute between russia and belarus in december and january also affected oil supplies to some european countries . the early warning system would include a hotline for emergency situations and obliges brussels and moscow to inform each other of potential problems through designated contacts . " the eu has sufficient reserves " but piebalgs said the warning system was not a signal of looming problems . " i have no doubts about security of supply for this winter , " he told reporters , adding that the eu had sufficient energy reserves to cover needs in the coming months . according to reuters , he also downplayed the effect of record high oil prices on gas prices . " there is a formula related to oil prices , but it does n't mean necessarily that this follows oil price fluctuations , " he said , adding that he expected tuesday 's price spike to fall within a week . khristenko said high oil prices would not largely affect gas prices . " i do n't expect major price changes compared to the current situation , " he said . energy is expected to be a top item on the agenda at an eu-russia summit in portugal on oct .

" the chinese juggernaut is , to some extent , out of control , " mandelson added . beijing in need of a course correction ? separately , serge abou , the eu 's ambassador to china , said on wednesday that beijing had n't done enough to assuage european concerns on a host of issues ranging from government subsidies for domestic industry to market access barriers for european imports or the yuan 's exchange rate . " we asked the chinese government for some correction , some policy changes , and we do not see a significant answer , " abou told reporters . the ambassador singled out the steel industry , saying chinese exports to the eu had grown from around 1 million tons in 2005 to 5 million tons last year - and could hit 12 million tons this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says china has been subsidizing its steel-making industry " we have some ideas that this export of steel has been subsidized and so we will not prevent our industry from raising some complaints , " abou said .
" if they raise some complaints , we will investigate . " abou added that the eu 's ballooning trade deficit with china , which reached 130 billion euros last year , would probably grow another 20 percent to 25 percent this year . " it is certain that these facts are considered with a certain bitterness in our leadership , and that we would like a real debate on these issues , " he said . currency tensions in contrast to the us - which is locked in trade disputes with china at the world trade organization - the eu has so far been less non-confrontational about pursuing punitive measures .
instead it has regularly cautioned beijing about issues such as intellectual property rights and the value of the yuan . both the us , which also has a trade gap with china , and the eu have criticized beijing about the value of the yuan , saying the chinese currency is massively undervalued to give chinese exporters an unfair advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yuan has weakened against the euro since it was de-linked from the dollar " if china makes an effort toward the dollar and does not make an effort towards the euro , while we are the first trade partner of china , there is something wrong in the reasoning , " abou said . a level playing field needed eu finance ministers last week singled out the yuan 's inflexibility as a primary culprit behind global market imbalances and said they planned to send a delegation to beijing later this year to discuss the currency . mandelson also told the bbc that there needed to be a level playing field on trade with china . " if we want to sustain a policy of openness towards china politically , we have to make sure that the public is satisfied that that trading relationship is being conducted on full and fair trade , otherwise we are going to be in trouble , " mandelson said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu and turkey have regularly reiterated that they remain committed to the independence , sovereignty , unity and territorial integrity of iraq .

17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says exports are a one-way street - from right to left while china is the eu 's biggest source of manufactured goods , european exports to china are of minor economic importance . the eu sold more goods to switzerland than it did to china , mandelson 's letter said , adding that the trade deficit between the eu and china was growing at about 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- every hour . " the chinese juggernaut is , to some extent , out of control , " mandelson added . beijing in need of a course correction ? separately , serge abou , the eu 's ambassador to china , said on wednesday that beijing had n't done enough to assuage european concerns on a host of issues ranging from government subsidies for domestic industry to market access barriers for european imports or the yuan 's exchange rate . " we asked the chinese government for some correction , some policy changes , and we do not see a significant answer , " abou told reporters . the ambassador singled out the steel industry , saying chinese exports to the eu had grown from around 1 million tons in 2005 to 5 million tons last year - and could hit 12 million tons this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says china has been subsidizing its steel-making industry " we have some ideas that this export of steel has been subsidized and so we will not prevent our industry from raising some complaints , " abou said .
" if they raise some complaints , we will investigate . " abou added that the eu 's ballooning trade deficit with china , which reached 130 billion euros last year , would probably grow another 20 percent to 25 percent this year . " it is certain that these facts are considered with a certain bitterness in our leadership , and that we would like a real debate on these issues , " he said . currency tensions in contrast to the us - which is locked in trade disputes with china at the world trade organization - the eu has so far been less non-confrontational about pursuing punitive measures .
instead it has regularly cautioned beijing about issues such as intellectual property rights and the value of the yuan . both the us , which also has a trade gap with china , and the eu have criticized beijing about the value of the yuan , saying the chinese currency is massively undervalued to give chinese exporters an unfair advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yuan has weakened against the euro since it was de-linked from the dollar " if china makes an effort toward the dollar and does not make an effort towards the euro , while we are the first trade partner of china , there is something wrong in the reasoning , " abou said . a level playing field needed eu finance ministers last week singled out the yuan 's inflexibility as a primary culprit behind global market imbalances and said they planned to send a delegation to beijing later this year to discuss the currency . mandelson also told the bbc that there needed to be a level playing field on trade with china . " if we want to sustain a policy of openness towards china politically , we have to make sure that the public is satisfied that that trading relationship is being conducted on full and fair trade , otherwise we are going to be in trouble , " mandelson said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says exports are a one-way street - from right to left while china is the eu 's biggest source of manufactured goods , european exports to china are of minor economic importance . the eu sold more goods to switzerland than it did to china , mandelson 's letter said , adding that the trade deficit between the eu and china was growing at about 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- every hour . " the chinese juggernaut is , to some extent , out of control , " mandelson added . beijing in need of a course correction ? separately , serge abou , the eu 's ambassador to china , said on wednesday that beijing had n't done enough to assuage european concerns on a host of issues ranging from government subsidies for domestic industry to market access barriers for european imports or the yuan 's exchange rate . " we asked the chinese government for some correction , some policy changes , and we do not see a significant answer , " abou told reporters . the ambassador singled out the steel industry , saying chinese exports to the eu had grown from around 1 million tons in 2005 to 5 million tons last year - and could hit 12 million tons this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says china has been subsidizing its steel-making industry " we have some ideas that this export of steel has been subsidized and so we will not prevent our industry from raising some complaints , " abou said .
" if they raise some complaints , we will investigate . " abou added that the eu 's ballooning trade deficit with china , which reached 130 billion euros last year , would probably grow another 20 percent to 25 percent this year . " it is certain that these facts are considered with a certain bitterness in our leadership , and that we would like a real debate on these issues , " he said . currency tensions in contrast to the us - which is locked in trade disputes with china at the world trade organization - the eu has so far been less non-confrontational about pursuing punitive measures .
instead it has regularly cautioned beijing about issues such as intellectual property rights and the value of the yuan . both the us , which also has a trade gap with china , and the eu have criticized beijing about the value of the yuan , saying the chinese currency is massively undervalued to give chinese exporters an unfair advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yuan has weakened against the euro since it was de-linked from the dollar " if china makes an effort toward the dollar and does not make an effort towards the euro , while we are the first trade partner of china , there is something wrong in the reasoning , " abou said . a level playing field needed eu finance ministers last week singled out the yuan 's inflexibility as a primary culprit behind global market imbalances and said they planned to send a delegation to beijing later this year to discuss the currency . mandelson also told the bbc that there needed to be a level playing field on trade with china . " if we want to sustain a policy of openness towards china politically , we have to make sure that the public is satisfied that that trading relationship is being conducted on full and fair trade , otherwise we are going to be in trouble , " mandelson said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu wants to avoid a repeat of the events of late 2005 , when gazprom cut its gas supplies to ukraine in a pricing battle that led to shortages in some eu countries . a dispute between russia and belarus in december and january also affected oil supplies to some european countries . the early warning system would include a hotline for emergency situations and obliges brussels and moscow to inform each other of potential problems through designated contacts . " the eu has sufficient reserves " but piebalgs said the warning system was not a signal of looming problems . " i have no doubts about security of supply for this winter , " he told reporters , adding that the eu had sufficient energy reserves to cover needs in the coming months . according to reuters , he also downplayed the effect of record high oil prices on gas prices .

17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says exports are a one-way street - from right to left while china is the eu 's biggest source of manufactured goods , european exports to china are of minor economic importance . the eu sold more goods to switzerland than it did to china , mandelson 's letter said , adding that the trade deficit between the eu and china was growing at about 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- every hour . " the chinese juggernaut is , to some extent , out of control , " mandelson added . beijing in need of a course correction ? separately , serge abou , the eu 's ambassador to china , said on wednesday that beijing had n't done enough to assuage european concerns on a host of issues ranging from government subsidies for domestic industry to market access barriers for european imports or the yuan 's exchange rate . " we asked the chinese government for some correction , some policy changes , and we do not see a significant answer , " abou told reporters . the ambassador singled out the steel industry , saying chinese exports to the eu had grown from around 1 million tons in 2005 to 5 million tons last year - and could hit 12 million tons this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says china has been subsidizing its steel-making industry " we have some ideas that this export of steel has been subsidized and so we will not prevent our industry from raising some complaints , " abou said .
" if they raise some complaints , we will investigate . " abou added that the eu 's ballooning trade deficit with china , which reached 130 billion euros last year , would probably grow another 20 percent to 25 percent this year . " it is certain that these facts are considered with a certain bitterness in our leadership , and that we would like a real debate on these issues , " he said . currency tensions in contrast to the us - which is locked in trade disputes with china at the world trade organization - the eu has so far been less non-confrontational about pursuing punitive measures .
instead it has regularly cautioned beijing about issues such as intellectual property rights and the value of the yuan . both the us , which also has a trade gap with china , and the eu have criticized beijing about the value of the yuan , saying the chinese currency is massively undervalued to give chinese exporters an unfair advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yuan has weakened against the euro since it was de-linked from the dollar " if china makes an effort toward the dollar and does not make an effort towards the euro , while we are the first trade partner of china , there is something wrong in the reasoning , " abou said . a level playing field needed eu finance ministers last week singled out the yuan 's inflexibility as a primary culprit behind global market imbalances and said they planned to send a delegation to beijing later this year to discuss the currency . mandelson also told the bbc that there needed to be a level playing field on trade with china . " if we want to sustain a policy of openness towards china politically , we have to make sure that the public is satisfied that that trading relationship is being conducted on full and fair trade , otherwise we are going to be in trouble , " mandelson said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says exports are a one-way street - from right to left while china is the eu 's biggest source of manufactured goods , european exports to china are of minor economic importance . the eu sold more goods to switzerland than it did to china , mandelson 's letter said , adding that the trade deficit between the eu and china was growing at about 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- every hour . " the chinese juggernaut is , to some extent , out of control , " mandelson added . beijing in need of a course correction ? separately , serge abou , the eu 's ambassador to china , said on wednesday that beijing had n't done enough to assuage european concerns on a host of issues ranging from government subsidies for domestic industry to market access barriers for european imports or the yuan 's exchange rate . " we asked the chinese government for some correction , some policy changes , and we do not see a significant answer , " abou told reporters . the ambassador singled out the steel industry , saying chinese exports to the eu had grown from around 1 million tons in 2005 to 5 million tons last year - and could hit 12 million tons this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says china has been subsidizing its steel-making industry " we have some ideas that this export of steel has been subsidized and so we will not prevent our industry from raising some complaints , " abou said .
" if they raise some complaints , we will investigate . " abou added that the eu 's ballooning trade deficit with china , which reached 130 billion euros last year , would probably grow another 20 percent to 25 percent this year . " it is certain that these facts are considered with a certain bitterness in our leadership , and that we would like a real debate on these issues , " he said . currency tensions in contrast to the us - which is locked in trade disputes with china at the world trade organization - the eu has so far been less non-confrontational about pursuing punitive measures .
instead it has regularly cautioned beijing about issues such as intellectual property rights and the value of the yuan . both the us , which also has a trade gap with china , and the eu have criticized beijing about the value of the yuan , saying the chinese currency is massively undervalued to give chinese exporters an unfair advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yuan has weakened against the euro since it was de-linked from the dollar " if china makes an effort toward the dollar and does not make an effort towards the euro , while we are the first trade partner of china , there is something wrong in the reasoning , " abou said . a level playing field needed eu finance ministers last week singled out the yuan 's inflexibility as a primary culprit behind global market imbalances and said they planned to send a delegation to beijing later this year to discuss the currency . mandelson also told the bbc that there needed to be a level playing field on trade with china . " if we want to sustain a policy of openness towards china politically , we have to make sure that the public is satisfied that that trading relationship is being conducted on full and fair trade , otherwise we are going to be in trouble , " mandelson said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , reiterated concerns over a european union energy market reform plan that moscow fears will hamper efforts by its gas monopolist , gazprom , to expand into europe . last month , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , proposed to disband major utility companies that control power supply , generation and transmission in a bid to boost competition and lower prices in the 27-member bloc . the commission , however , inserted a clause in the proposed legislation to bar foreign companies from controlling european pipelines and power grids unless they adhere to the same rules as eu firms and their home country has reached an agreement with officials in brussels . loophole could aim at gazprom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy is also a security concern for many countries the loophole was immediately dubbed the " gazprom clause " by commentators who argued that it was specifically aimed at the russian monopolist company .
russian energy officials have criticized the eu 's proposal as protectionism . at a press conference after talks on tuesday , however , piebalgs said a group of russian and eu analysts would review the " gazprom clause " and that khristenko had agreed to await the review before making a final political decision . " i appreciate this very pragmatic approach , " piebalgs said at the news conference . " we are interested in active consultation with our european colleagues on new energy initiatives , " khristenko said , according to reuters . early warning system on energy despite the on-going dispute , khristenko and piebalgs agreed on setting up an " energy early warning system " to help avoid problems in the supply of or demand for russian energy deliveries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not want a repeat of gas shortages from russia russia is the eu 's biggest supplier of gas , most of which reaches the bloc through the ukraine .
the eu wants to avoid a repeat of the events of late 2005 , when gazprom cut its gas supplies to ukraine in a pricing battle that led to shortages in some eu countries . a dispute between russia and belarus in december and january also affected oil supplies to some european countries . the early warning system would include a hotline for emergency situations and obliges brussels and moscow to inform each other of potential problems through designated contacts . " the eu has sufficient reserves " but piebalgs said the warning system was not a signal of looming problems . " i have no doubts about security of supply for this winter , " he told reporters , adding that the eu had sufficient energy reserves to cover needs in the coming months . according to reuters , he also downplayed the effect of record high oil prices on gas prices . " there is a formula related to oil prices , but it does n't mean necessarily that this follows oil price fluctuations , " he said , adding that he expected tuesday 's price spike to fall within a week . khristenko said high oil prices would not largely affect gas prices . " i do n't expect major price changes compared to the current situation , " he said . energy is expected to be a top item on the agenda at an eu-russia summit in portugal on oct .

17 , allows the government to order cross-border operations in order to deal with an estimated 3,500 rebels from the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- that are based in mountainous northern iraq . prime minister tayyip erdogan has played down expectations of an imminent offensive , but the parliamentary approval provides the legal basis for nato 's second biggest army to cross the border as and when it sees fit for one year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on iraq tuesday to crack down on kurdish rebels after the vote , the european commission said it hoped turkey would decide to respect the territorial integrity of iraq . " it is crucial that turkey continues to tackle this problem through cooperation between the relevant authorities , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy said .
" the eu and turkey have regularly reiterated that they remain committed to the independence , sovereignty , unity and territorial integrity of iraq . " erdogan said that parliament 's decision does not mean an immediate incursion will follow . " we will act at the right time and under the right conditions , " erdogan told his ruling ak party on tuesday . recent attacks on turkey over the past few weeks , members of the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- have staged renewed attacks on targets in turkey from iraqi territory .
according to the turkish government , over two dozens soldiers and civilians have been killed . both the eu and the united states have classified the pkk as a terrorist organization .
the turkish government estimates that there are around 3,500 kurdish rebels in northern iraq . despite the pkk 's presence , the region is relatively peaceful and the us has expressed concerns that an attack would destabilize the last calm area in iraq .
us president george w. bush said on wednesday that the us was making it clear to turkey that military action in iraq would not be in ankara 's interest . iraq prime minister nouri al-maliki said his government was determined to halt the " terrorist activities " of the pkk on iraqi territory .
he also said the two nations needed to continue to talk , his office said in a statement . turkey threatens to withdraw support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pkk has been active for over 20 years the turkish parliament 's decision comes at a time of tension in us-turkish relations .
the us house of representatives is considering a resolution to call the world war i mass killings of armenians by turkey 's ottoman empire a genocide .
turkey has threatened to withdraw its logistical support for the war in iraq , including use of a strategically important air base on turkish territory , if the measure is approved . in its quest for an ethnic homeland in southern turkey , the pkk has been active since the early 1980s .
ankara attributes more than 30,000 deaths to the group 's armed struggle . " in the past several years , turkey has conducted 24 cross-border military operations , " akin birdal , human rights activist and a member of turkey 's parliament , told the germany daily frankfurter rundschau .

17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says exports are a one-way street - from right to left while china is the eu 's biggest source of manufactured goods , european exports to china are of minor economic importance . the eu sold more goods to switzerland than it did to china , mandelson 's letter said , adding that the trade deficit between the eu and china was growing at about 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- every hour . " the chinese juggernaut is , to some extent , out of control , " mandelson added . beijing in need of a course correction ? separately , serge abou , the eu 's ambassador to china , said on wednesday that beijing had n't done enough to assuage european concerns on a host of issues ranging from government subsidies for domestic industry to market access barriers for european imports or the yuan 's exchange rate . " we asked the chinese government for some correction , some policy changes , and we do not see a significant answer , " abou told reporters . the ambassador singled out the steel industry , saying chinese exports to the eu had grown from around 1 million tons in 2005 to 5 million tons last year - and could hit 12 million tons this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says china has been subsidizing its steel-making industry " we have some ideas that this export of steel has been subsidized and so we will not prevent our industry from raising some complaints , " abou said .
" if they raise some complaints , we will investigate . " abou added that the eu 's ballooning trade deficit with china , which reached 130 billion euros last year , would probably grow another 20 percent to 25 percent this year . " it is certain that these facts are considered with a certain bitterness in our leadership , and that we would like a real debate on these issues , " he said . currency tensions in contrast to the us - which is locked in trade disputes with china at the world trade organization - the eu has so far been less non-confrontational about pursuing punitive measures .
instead it has regularly cautioned beijing about issues such as intellectual property rights and the value of the yuan . both the us , which also has a trade gap with china , and the eu have criticized beijing about the value of the yuan , saying the chinese currency is massively undervalued to give chinese exporters an unfair advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yuan has weakened against the euro since it was de-linked from the dollar " if china makes an effort toward the dollar and does not make an effort towards the euro , while we are the first trade partner of china , there is something wrong in the reasoning , " abou said . a level playing field needed eu finance ministers last week singled out the yuan 's inflexibility as a primary culprit behind global market imbalances and said they planned to send a delegation to beijing later this year to discuss the currency . mandelson also told the bbc that there needed to be a level playing field on trade with china . " if we want to sustain a policy of openness towards china politically , we have to make sure that the public is satisfied that that trading relationship is being conducted on full and fair trade , otherwise we are going to be in trouble , " mandelson said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , reiterated concerns over a european union energy market reform plan that moscow fears will hamper efforts by its gas monopolist , gazprom , to expand into europe . last month , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , proposed to disband major utility companies that control power supply , generation and transmission in a bid to boost competition and lower prices in the 27-member bloc . the commission , however , inserted a clause in the proposed legislation to bar foreign companies from controlling european pipelines and power grids unless they adhere to the same rules as eu firms and their home country has reached an agreement with officials in brussels . loophole could aim at gazprom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy is also a security concern for many countries the loophole was immediately dubbed the " gazprom clause " by commentators who argued that it was specifically aimed at the russian monopolist company .
russian energy officials have criticized the eu 's proposal as protectionism . at a press conference after talks on tuesday , however , piebalgs said a group of russian and eu analysts would review the " gazprom clause " and that khristenko had agreed to await the review before making a final political decision . " i appreciate this very pragmatic approach , " piebalgs said at the news conference . " we are interested in active consultation with our european colleagues on new energy initiatives , " khristenko said , according to reuters . early warning system on energy despite the on-going dispute , khristenko and piebalgs agreed on setting up an " energy early warning system " to help avoid problems in the supply of or demand for russian energy deliveries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not want a repeat of gas shortages from russia russia is the eu 's biggest supplier of gas , most of which reaches the bloc through the ukraine .
the eu wants to avoid a repeat of the events of late 2005 , when gazprom cut its gas supplies to ukraine in a pricing battle that led to shortages in some eu countries . a dispute between russia and belarus in december and january also affected oil supplies to some european countries . the early warning system would include a hotline for emergency situations and obliges brussels and moscow to inform each other of potential problems through designated contacts . " the eu has sufficient reserves " but piebalgs said the warning system was not a signal of looming problems . " i have no doubts about security of supply for this winter , " he told reporters , adding that the eu had sufficient energy reserves to cover needs in the coming months . according to reuters , he also downplayed the effect of record high oil prices on gas prices . " there is a formula related to oil prices , but it does n't mean necessarily that this follows oil price fluctuations , " he said , adding that he expected tuesday 's price spike to fall within a week . khristenko said high oil prices would not largely affect gas prices . " i do n't expect major price changes compared to the current situation , " he said . energy is expected to be a top item on the agenda at an eu-russia summit in portugal on oct .

" the eu and turkey have regularly reiterated that they remain committed to the independence , sovereignty , unity and territorial integrity of iraq .

" we will act at the right time and under the right conditions , " erdogan told his ruling ak party on tuesday . recent attacks on turkey over the past few weeks , members of the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- have staged renewed attacks on targets in turkey from iraqi territory .

us president george w. bush said on wednesday that the us was making it clear to turkey that military action in iraq would not be in ankara 's interest . iraq prime minister nouri al-maliki said his government was determined to halt the " terrorist activities " of the pkk on iraqi territory .

17 , allows the government to order cross-border operations in order to deal with an estimated 3,500 rebels from the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- that are based in mountainous northern iraq . prime minister tayyip erdogan has played down expectations of an imminent offensive , but the parliamentary approval provides the legal basis for nato 's second biggest army to cross the border as and when it sees fit for one year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on iraq tuesday to crack down on kurdish rebels after the vote , the european commission said it hoped turkey would decide to respect the territorial integrity of iraq . " it is crucial that turkey continues to tackle this problem through cooperation between the relevant authorities , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy said .
" the eu and turkey have regularly reiterated that they remain committed to the independence , sovereignty , unity and territorial integrity of iraq . " erdogan said that parliament 's decision does not mean an immediate incursion will follow . " we will act at the right time and under the right conditions , " erdogan told his ruling ak party on tuesday . recent attacks on turkey over the past few weeks , members of the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- have staged renewed attacks on targets in turkey from iraqi territory .
according to the turkish government , over two dozens soldiers and civilians have been killed . both the eu and the united states have classified the pkk as a terrorist organization .
the turkish government estimates that there are around 3,500 kurdish rebels in northern iraq . despite the pkk 's presence , the region is relatively peaceful and the us has expressed concerns that an attack would destabilize the last calm area in iraq .
us president george w. bush said on wednesday that the us was making it clear to turkey that military action in iraq would not be in ankara 's interest . iraq prime minister nouri al-maliki said his government was determined to halt the " terrorist activities " of the pkk on iraqi territory .
he also said the two nations needed to continue to talk , his office said in a statement . turkey threatens to withdraw support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pkk has been active for over 20 years the turkish parliament 's decision comes at a time of tension in us-turkish relations .
the us house of representatives is considering a resolution to call the world war i mass killings of armenians by turkey 's ottoman empire a genocide .
turkey has threatened to withdraw its logistical support for the war in iraq , including use of a strategically important air base on turkish territory , if the measure is approved . in its quest for an ethnic homeland in southern turkey , the pkk has been active since the early 1980s .
ankara attributes more than 30,000 deaths to the group 's armed struggle . " in the past several years , turkey has conducted 24 cross-border military operations , " akin birdal , human rights activist and a member of turkey 's parliament , told the germany daily frankfurter rundschau .

17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says exports are a one-way street - from right to left while china is the eu 's biggest source of manufactured goods , european exports to china are of minor economic importance . the eu sold more goods to switzerland than it did to china , mandelson 's letter said , adding that the trade deficit between the eu and china was growing at about 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- every hour . " the chinese juggernaut is , to some extent , out of control , " mandelson added . beijing in need of a course correction ? separately , serge abou , the eu 's ambassador to china , said on wednesday that beijing had n't done enough to assuage european concerns on a host of issues ranging from government subsidies for domestic industry to market access barriers for european imports or the yuan 's exchange rate . " we asked the chinese government for some correction , some policy changes , and we do not see a significant answer , " abou told reporters . the ambassador singled out the steel industry , saying chinese exports to the eu had grown from around 1 million tons in 2005 to 5 million tons last year - and could hit 12 million tons this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says china has been subsidizing its steel-making industry " we have some ideas that this export of steel has been subsidized and so we will not prevent our industry from raising some complaints , " abou said .
" if they raise some complaints , we will investigate . " abou added that the eu 's ballooning trade deficit with china , which reached 130 billion euros last year , would probably grow another 20 percent to 25 percent this year . " it is certain that these facts are considered with a certain bitterness in our leadership , and that we would like a real debate on these issues , " he said . currency tensions in contrast to the us - which is locked in trade disputes with china at the world trade organization - the eu has so far been less non-confrontational about pursuing punitive measures .
instead it has regularly cautioned beijing about issues such as intellectual property rights and the value of the yuan . both the us , which also has a trade gap with china , and the eu have criticized beijing about the value of the yuan , saying the chinese currency is massively undervalued to give chinese exporters an unfair advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yuan has weakened against the euro since it was de-linked from the dollar " if china makes an effort toward the dollar and does not make an effort towards the euro , while we are the first trade partner of china , there is something wrong in the reasoning , " abou said . a level playing field needed eu finance ministers last week singled out the yuan 's inflexibility as a primary culprit behind global market imbalances and said they planned to send a delegation to beijing later this year to discuss the currency . mandelson also told the bbc that there needed to be a level playing field on trade with china . " if we want to sustain a policy of openness towards china politically , we have to make sure that the public is satisfied that that trading relationship is being conducted on full and fair trade , otherwise we are going to be in trouble , " mandelson said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , reiterated concerns over a european union energy market reform plan that moscow fears will hamper efforts by its gas monopolist , gazprom , to expand into europe . last month , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , proposed to disband major utility companies that control power supply , generation and transmission in a bid to boost competition and lower prices in the 27-member bloc . the commission , however , inserted a clause in the proposed legislation to bar foreign companies from controlling european pipelines and power grids unless they adhere to the same rules as eu firms and their home country has reached an agreement with officials in brussels . loophole could aim at gazprom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy is also a security concern for many countries the loophole was immediately dubbed the " gazprom clause " by commentators who argued that it was specifically aimed at the russian monopolist company .
russian energy officials have criticized the eu 's proposal as protectionism . at a press conference after talks on tuesday , however , piebalgs said a group of russian and eu analysts would review the " gazprom clause " and that khristenko had agreed to await the review before making a final political decision . " i appreciate this very pragmatic approach , " piebalgs said at the news conference . " we are interested in active consultation with our european colleagues on new energy initiatives , " khristenko said , according to reuters . early warning system on energy despite the on-going dispute , khristenko and piebalgs agreed on setting up an " energy early warning system " to help avoid problems in the supply of or demand for russian energy deliveries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not want a repeat of gas shortages from russia russia is the eu 's biggest supplier of gas , most of which reaches the bloc through the ukraine .
the eu wants to avoid a repeat of the events of late 2005 , when gazprom cut its gas supplies to ukraine in a pricing battle that led to shortages in some eu countries . a dispute between russia and belarus in december and january also affected oil supplies to some european countries . the early warning system would include a hotline for emergency situations and obliges brussels and moscow to inform each other of potential problems through designated contacts . " the eu has sufficient reserves " but piebalgs said the warning system was not a signal of looming problems . " i have no doubts about security of supply for this winter , " he told reporters , adding that the eu had sufficient energy reserves to cover needs in the coming months . according to reuters , he also downplayed the effect of record high oil prices on gas prices . " there is a formula related to oil prices , but it does n't mean necessarily that this follows oil price fluctuations , " he said , adding that he expected tuesday 's price spike to fall within a week . khristenko said high oil prices would not largely affect gas prices . " i do n't expect major price changes compared to the current situation , " he said . energy is expected to be a top item on the agenda at an eu-russia summit in portugal on oct .

the eu wants to avoid a repeat of the events of late 2005 , when gazprom cut its gas supplies to ukraine in a pricing battle that led to shortages in some eu countries . a dispute between russia and belarus in december and january also affected oil supplies to some european countries . the early warning system would include a hotline for emergency situations and obliges brussels and moscow to inform each other of potential problems through designated contacts . " the eu has sufficient reserves " but piebalgs said the warning system was not a signal of looming problems . " i have no doubts about security of supply for this winter , " he told reporters , adding that the eu had sufficient energy reserves to cover needs in the coming months . according to reuters , he also downplayed the effect of record high oil prices on gas prices . " there is a formula related to oil prices , but it does n't mean necessarily that this follows oil price fluctuations , " he said , adding that he expected tuesday 's price spike to fall within a week . khristenko said high oil prices would not largely affect gas prices . " i do n't expect major price changes compared to the current situation , " he said . energy is expected to be a top item on the agenda at an eu-russia summit in portugal on oct .

" the chinese juggernaut is , to some extent , out of control , " mandelson added . beijing in need of a course correction ? separately , serge abou , the eu 's ambassador to china , said on wednesday that beijing had n't done enough to assuage european concerns on a host of issues ranging from government subsidies for domestic industry to market access barriers for european imports or the yuan 's exchange rate . " we asked the chinese government for some correction , some policy changes , and we do not see a significant answer , " abou told reporters . the ambassador singled out the steel industry , saying chinese exports to the eu had grown from around 1 million tons in 2005 to 5 million tons last year - and could hit 12 million tons this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says china has been subsidizing its steel-making industry " we have some ideas that this export of steel has been subsidized and so we will not prevent our industry from raising some complaints , " abou said .

" it is certain that these facts are considered with a certain bitterness in our leadership , and that we would like a real debate on these issues , " he said . currency tensions in contrast to the us - which is locked in trade disputes with china at the world trade organization - the eu has so far been less non-confrontational about pursuing punitive measures .
instead it has regularly cautioned beijing about issues such as intellectual property rights and the value of the yuan . both the us , which also has a trade gap with china , and the eu have criticized beijing about the value of the yuan , saying the chinese currency is massively undervalued to give chinese exporters an unfair advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yuan has weakened against the euro since it was de-linked from the dollar " if china makes an effort toward the dollar and does not make an effort towards the euro , while we are the first trade partner of china , there is something wrong in the reasoning , " abou said . a level playing field needed eu finance ministers last week singled out the yuan 's inflexibility as a primary culprit behind global market imbalances and said they planned to send a delegation to beijing later this year to discuss the currency . mandelson also told the bbc that there needed to be a level playing field on trade with china .

since the law changed in july , it is now legal to make up to 2,500 litres of your own biodiesel , enough to run the average family car , without having to pay tax .
" home brewers " convert chip fat from pubs and restaurants , which would otherwise go straight to landfill .
companies who make the kits needed to convert this unwanted oil are reporting a steady rise in sales .
thousands of enthusiasts are also expected to attend a biofuels trade fare in nottinghamshire on 17 and 18 october .
home brew dan purkis , a consultant engineer , puts home-brewed fuel into the tanks of his 4x4 , even though he is based in aberdeen - the oil capital of the uk .
he admits that messing about with old chip fat is not for everyone but adds : " it 's interesting and fun and it reduces my impact on the environment ?
" when i looked at my lifestyle i realised that fuel was the greatest energy user in my life . "
you can buy conversion kits from £ 700 but mr purkis has made his own .
he told the bbc 's you and yours programme : " no special tools were required and nothing was beyond the ability of a typical diy enthusiast .
most of the parts were bought second hand or salvaged from scrap yards .
" i recycle used vegetable oil from a local hotel .
they throw away between 50 and 100 litres a week which would otherwise go to landfill . "
once he gets it home , he puts the oil through a series of refinements : allows sediment in the oil to settle to the bottom of the bottle pumps and filters the top 70 % of the oil ; it is pure enough to put straight into his car treats the remaining sludge and converts it into biodiesel by adding methanol and caustic soda heats the oil , causing it to react with the caustic soda the waste product from this process is glycerin , which has to be washed out of the biodiesel with soap and half-water to half-fuel .
he then composts the glycerin .
mr purkis says his car runs better on biodiesel : " it 's smoother - better lubricated . "
even though he is a qualified engineer , he insists that it is not a difficult process .
" if you can follow a recipe , you can make biodiesel , " he explains .
" there 's lots of information out there on websites and forums and in books . "
motoring agencies , however , suggest a more cautious approach .
vanessa guyll of the aa says using clean vegetable oil is possible in cars with older pumps .
but she adds : " because it 's thicker it can affect the injector .
" some diesel pumps are more vulnerable than others , and if your pump goes it could cost up to £ 1,200 to replace it . "
mr purkis reckons you can get round this by modifying your vehicle to warm the oil up which makes it less viscous .
he says you can adapt your car so that the fuel pipe is near the car 's heater : " you can do this yourself if you know a bit about cars or you can buy a conversion kit . "
but the aa has another word of caution .
" using a small amount mixed with regular fuel is okay but a higher concentrate can block filters , " explains vanessa guyll .
" if you 're in any doubt about putting biofuels in your car , contact the manufacturer of your vehicle . "
and christopher mcgowan , chief executive of the society of motoring manufacturers and traders -lrb- smmt -rrb- , adds : " you have to be very careful in the manufacturing process .
there are some tricky chemicals . "
he also warns anyone with a new car under warranty against using their own biofuel .
" if you buy a brand new car , you would want to be very certain that it was approved by the dealer . "
a discussion on biofuel with dan purkis and two other biofuel experts is available at the radio 4 you and yours website .

since the law changed in july , it is now legal to make up to 2,500 litres of your own biodiesel , enough to run the average family car , without having to pay tax .
" home brewers " convert chip fat from pubs and restaurants , which would otherwise go straight to landfill .
companies who make the kits needed to convert this unwanted oil are reporting a steady rise in sales .
thousands of enthusiasts are also expected to attend a biofuels trade fare in nottinghamshire on 17 and 18 october .
home brew dan purkis , a consultant engineer , puts home-brewed fuel into the tanks of his 4x4 , even though he is based in aberdeen - the oil capital of the uk .
hear dan purkis & biofuel experts on you and yours he admits that messing about with old chip fat is not for everyone but adds : " it 's interesting and fun and it reduces my impact on the environment ?
" when i looked at my lifestyle i realised that fuel was the greatest energy user in my life . "
you can buy conversion kits from £ 700 but mr purkis has made his own .
he told the bbc 's you and yours programme : " no special tools were required and nothing was beyond the ability of a typical diy enthusiast .
most of the parts were bought second hand or salvaged from scrap yards .
" i recycle used vegetable oil from a local hotel .
they throw away between 50 and 100 litres a week which would otherwise go to landfill . "
once he gets it home , he puts the oil through a series of refinements : allows sediment in the oil to settle to the bottom of the bottle pumps and filters the top 70 % of the oil ; it is pure enough to put straight into his car treats the remaining sludge and converts it into biodiesel by adding methanol and caustic soda heats the oil , causing it to react with the caustic soda the waste product from this process is glycerin , which has to be washed out of the biodiesel with soap and half-water to half-fuel .
he then composts the glycerin .
mr purkis says his car runs better on biodiesel : " it 's smoother - better lubricated . "
even though he is a qualified engineer , he insists that it is not a difficult process .
" if you can follow a recipe , you can make biodiesel , " he explains .
" there 's lots of information out there on websites and forums and in books . "
rising pump prices make home-made fuels more appealing motoring agencies , however , suggest a more cautious approach .
vanessa guyll of the aa says using clean vegetable oil is possible in cars with older pumps .
but she adds : " because it 's thicker it can affect the injector .
" some diesel pumps are more vulnerable than others , and if your pump goes it could cost up to £ 1,200 to replace it . "
mr purkis reckons you can get round this by modifying your vehicle to warm the oil up which makes it less viscous .
he says you can adapt your car so that the fuel pipe is near the car 's heater : " you can do this yourself if you know a bit about cars or you can buy a conversion kit . "
but the aa has another word of caution .
" using a small amount mixed with regular fuel is okay but a higher concentrate can block filters , " explains vanessa guyll .

the fijian leader made the commitment at an annual summit of leaders from around the pacific region in tonga .
he had until now only agreed " in principle " to the polls , and had faced pressure to formalise his stance .
pacific leaders welcomed his pledge and in a statement urged his government to give the polls " the highest priority " .
fiji 's military seized power from the elected government in december 2006 in a bloodless coup .
" very good outcome " the country 's return to democracy has dominated the two-day meeting of the 16-member pacific islands forum .
new zealand prime minister helen clark described the commitment as a " very good outcome for the forum " .
" the leaders would not have settled for anything less than an absolute acceptance of the timetable for no later than the first quarter of 2009 , " she said .
australian foreign minister alexander downer , who is representing prime minister john howard as he prepares for a general election , called the move " heartening " .
both new zealand and australia imposed sanctions on fiji in the wake of the coup .
ms clark and mr downer said that these could be reviewed once fiji made progress towards elections .

" ultimately , westmorland general hospital will lose its acute medical admissions , but it is only right that nothing should go before alternative arrangements have been fully tested and put in place .
" members of the committee welcome the fact that the trust has been brave enough to admit that it was premature in closing the ward .
" it should not be criticised for ' u-turns ' or ' back-pedalling ' , instead it should be congratulated for finally acting on local concerns . "

the american society for reproductive medicine -lrb- asrm -rrb- warned the procedure was still experimental , and the chances of success poor .
it said it would be wrong to give women a false sense of hope .
instead they should be offered counselling .
however , a uk expert said egg freezing was a valid option for some women . "
it is wrong to deprive women of this option , which many of them say is empowering " dr gillian lockwood midland fertility services an increasing number of women are choosing to freeze their eggs for social reasons in the hope they will be able to have a child when they are older .
critics argue they are delaying motherhood for the wrong motives , such as climbing the career ladder or until they have more money .
dr marc fritz , of the asrm , said it would be wrong for women who have frozen their eggs to think they had ensured their future fertility .
he said : " existing medical evidence simply does not justify that conclusion . "
the asrm estimates that the overall live birth rate from frozen eggs is as low as 2 % per egg .
it warned the figures may be even lower for women over 35 - the age at which fertility begins to decline rapidly .
dr fritz said a 25-year-old woman freezing her eggs now would have more chance of achieving a pregnancy through ivf using her fresh eggs when she was 35 .
successes at the end of 2006 , 185 women in the uk had eggs on ice .
many are cancer patients whose fertility is affected by treatment .
four babies have been born from egg freezing in the uk - all following treatment at midland fertility services .
dr gillian lockwood , medical director , argued success rates using frozen eggs were comparable with those using frozen embryos .
she dissuades older women from freezing their eggs due to low success rates .
but she added : " as long as women know it 's not an insurance policy or a guarantee , then it remains an option they may wish to pursue . "
" many of those women have been with commitment-phobic men or have not found mr right , or they are part of a couple that needs two salaries to get a mortgage .
" these are social issues but it is wrong to deprive women of this option , which many of them say is empowering . "
caution key dr simon fishel , of the care fertility group in nottingham , agreed it was important to explain to women that egg freezing was experimental , and carried no guarantee of success .
" although significant research has been undertaken , and babies are being born from these new techniques , caution and counselling are imperative at this stage , and for several years to come . "
josephine quintavalle , of the campaign group comment on reproductive ethics , said the asrm had issued " sound advice " .
she said : " the best solution to lifestyle problems is to change one 's lifestyle .
" have babies naturally at the time nature intended and give ivf a miss altogether . "

the american society for reproductive medicine -lrb- asrm -rrb- warned the procedure was still experimental , and the chances of success poor .
it said it would be wrong to give women a false sense of hope .
instead they should be offered counselling .
however , a uk expert said egg freezing was a valid option for some women .
it is wrong to deprive women of this option , which many of them say is empowering dr gillian lockwood midland fertility services an increasing number of women are choosing to freeze their eggs for social reasons in the hope they will be able to have a child when they are older .
critics argue they are delaying motherhood for the wrong motives , such as climbing the career ladder or until they have more money .
dr marc fritz , of the asrm , said it would be wrong for women who have frozen their eggs to think they had ensured their future fertility .
he said : " existing medical evidence simply does not justify that conclusion . "
the asrm estimates that the overall live birth rate from frozen eggs is as low as 2 % per egg .
it warned the figures may be even lower for women over 35 - the age at which fertility begins to decline rapidly .
dr fritz said a 25-year-old woman freezing her eggs now would have more chance of achieving a pregnancy through ivf using her fresh eggs when she was 35 .

dr gillian lockwood , medical director , argued success rates using frozen eggs were comparable with those using frozen embryos .
she dissuades older women from freezing their eggs due to low success rates .
but she added : " as long as women know it 's not an insurance policy or a guarantee , then it remains an option they may wish to pursue . "
" many of those women have been with commitment-phobic men or have not found mr right , or they are part of a couple that needs two salaries to get a mortgage .
" these are social issues but it is wrong to deprive women of this option , which many of them say is empowering . "
caution key dr simon fishel , of the care fertility group in nottingham , agreed it was important to explain to women that egg freezing was experimental , and carried no guarantee of success .
" although significant research has been undertaken , and babies are being born from these new techniques , caution and counselling are imperative at this stage , and for several years to come . "
josephine quintavalle , of the campaign group comment on reproductive ethics , said the asrm had issued " sound advice " .
she said : " the best solution to lifestyle problems is to change one 's lifestyle .
" have babies naturally at the time nature intended and give ivf a miss altogether . "

the story is told through the eyes of veronica hegarty , a 39-year-old married mother of two .
out of all her brothers and sisters , it is veronica who takes the news of her alcoholic brother 's suicide the hardest .
throughout the book she regales memories of their childhood to help her to remember a dark secret the two youngsters had kept hidden for years .
the most significant part of their childhood was spent living with their grandmother , ada .
veronica 's grief in the current day is intertwined with vague memories of her childhood and a half-imagined account of her grandmother 's life .
the sibling bond between veronica and liam is clear from the start , as she looks back with fondness at the time they spent together as children .
but as time passes , enright conveys how veronica 's love for her brother becomes complicated and confused .
" this was not the first time i left my brother , and it would not be the last .
in his later , drinking years , i left him every time he arrived .
but even before he hit the bottle , there were times when i just had to roll my eyes and walk away . "
dysfunctional family at times one can not be sure she had liked him at all in later life .
enright 's work was called ' exhilaratingly bleak ' by judges " drink made him vicious , but even sober he could smell what was going on in a room , i swear it , because the place liam worked best was under your skin . "
one can not help but be drawn into the story to learn more about this dysfunctional family , and discover if veronica will ever come to terms with what happened to her brother which affected him so dramatically in later life .
loss is a theme which occurs throughout the book in many forms - not just through death .
the loss of an innocent childhood is also explored , as well as veronica 's sad realisation that her " vague " and forgetful " mother is slipping away from her .
liam is the third hegarty sibling to die from a family of 12 , and death was something veronica had been made aware of from a young age .
" i was still eight , and liam was nine , and we were going to ' say goodbye ' to charlie .
i think i knew , even at eight , that you can say goodbye all you like , but when someone is dead they 're not going to say anything back . "
dark humour despite the unsettling and bleak matter of the book , enright displays occasional hints of dark humour .
she uses liam 's funeral to portray veronica 's hurt and upset frame of mind .
" all the hegarty children have a hangover , including the one in the box .
it is a very peaceful , precious kind off feeling ; a swelling of the senses , between pain and warmth .
" liam has the biggest one of all , of course , because liam finally got out of his head .
he will be sleeping this one off , for a while . "
the gathering is a captivating and sad story of a woman 's unbroken silence , who yearns to repair damage already done .

the story is told through the eyes of veronica hegarty , a 39-year-old married mother of two .
out of all her brothers and sisters , it is veronica who takes the news of her alcoholic brother 's suicide the hardest .
throughout the book she regales memories of their childhood to help her to remember a dark secret the two youngsters had kept hidden for years .
the most significant part of their childhood was spent living with their grandmother , ada .
veronica 's grief in the current day is intertwined with vague memories of her childhood and a half-imagined account of her grandmother 's life .
the sibling bond between veronica and liam is clear from the start , as she looks back with fondness at the time they spent together as children .
but as time passes , enright conveys how veronica 's love for her brother becomes complicated and confused .
" this was not the first time i left my brother , and it would not be the last .
in his later , drinking years , i left him every time he arrived .
but even before he hit the bottle , there were times when i just had to roll my eyes and walk away . "
dysfunctional family at times one can not be sure she had liked him at all in later life .
enright 's work was called ' exhilaratingly bleak ' by judges " drink made him vicious , but even sober he could smell what was going on in a room , i swear it , because the place liam worked best was under your skin . "
one can not help but be drawn into the story to learn more about this dysfunctional family , and discover if veronica will ever come to terms with what happened to her brother which affected him so dramatically in later life .
loss is a theme which occurs throughout the book in many forms - not just through death .
the loss of an innocent childhood is also explored , as well as veronica 's sad realisation that her " vague " and forgetful " mother is slipping away from her .
liam is the third hegarty sibling to die from a family of 12 , and death was something veronica had been made aware of from a young age .
" i was still eight , and liam was nine , and we were going to ' say goodbye ' to charlie .
i think i knew , even at eight , that you can say goodbye all you like , but when someone is dead they 're not going to say anything back . "
dark humour despite the unsettling and bleak matter of the book , enright displays occasional hints of dark humour .
she uses liam 's funeral to portray veronica 's hurt and upset frame of mind .
" all the hegarty children have a hangover , including the one in the box .
it is a very peaceful , precious kind off feeling ; a swelling of the senses , between pain and warmth .
" liam has the biggest one of all , of course , because liam finally got out of his head .
he will be sleeping this one off , for a while . "
the gathering is a captivating and sad story of a woman 's unbroken silence , who yearns to repair damage already done .

as house prices have trebled over the last 10 years and analysts are debating whether this is the top of the market , what will happen to the value of people 's homes ?
getting a foothold , and staying , on the property ladder has never been so difficult .
whether it is buying , selling , renting or simply keeping up with the mortgage payments , andrew verity , bbc radio 5 live 's business and finance expert , travels around the uk to explore the issues surrounding the property market .
programme one in the first of three programmes , andrew discovers what the options are for people trying to get on - and stay on - the property ladder .
in this climate of uncertainty , where the volatility of the stock market makes it hard to predict which way the property market is headed , the outlook for first-time buyers is pretty grim .
this is demonstrated by the stories in the series .
dawn decides to spend her summer camping in a queue for the chance to buy a house , and cathie , who at 36 still lives with her parents , opts to go online in a bid to find a stranger to buy with .
as record house prices and increasing interest rates are pushing people out of the property market , andrew assesses the economic factors which determine how much people pay for their mortgages .
andrew meets those who are feeling that they have totally overstretched themselves and , after borrowing seven times their salary , can they stay in the property market or is repossession around the corner ?
an increasing number of private companies now offer mortgage rescue schemes , promising to relieve homeowners of their financial burdens .
programme two in episode two of the series , andrew verity discovers that , while there are big winners , there are also big losers , and reveals some remarkable facts about the way the market works .
whether potential buyers feel they have hit the jackpot or high prices stand between them and their dream home , they still need to ask themselves if the property is a good investment .
in nicholina 's situation , her two sons are forced to share a bedroom with their grandmother because she has been priced out of moving up the ladder .
she bought a two-bedroom maisonette in london four years ago for £ 125,000 .
it is now worth £ 200,000 , but it is not enough to buy a three-bedroom house .
she has made money on paper , but not in reality .
andrew looks at some success stories , too .
george , who bought his council house in hackney 14 years ago for £ 37,000 and , following a sale , has just made a profit of half a million pounds , leaving scope for more investment .
programme three whilst more and more people believe they have missed out on the opportunity to get on the property ladder , andrew verity goes in search of alternative solutions to buying a house in the third and final part of the series .
dominic is a paramedic and feels he can not afford to buy in his area .
although his other job as a fireman increases his income to the point where it might be possible for him to buy , he must live within two miles of the fire station which limits his choices .
when his housing association offers him the opportunity to buy their home , dominic faces a very hard decision .
andrew also meets sarah who bought a piece of land with farm buildings on it .
by deciding to live in the building sarah breaks the planning laws and the local council have now threatened to throw her out .
the programme also looks at the better opportunities that renting offers in countries like germany and whether the law should change in the uk .

as house prices have trebled over the last 10 years and analysts are debating whether this is the top of the market , what will happen to the value of people 's homes ?
getting a foothold , and staying , on the property ladder has never been so difficult .
whether it is buying , selling , renting or simply keeping up with the mortgage payments , andrew verity , bbc radio 5 live 's business and finance expert , travels around the uk to explore the issues surrounding the property market .
programme one in the first of three programmes , andrew discovers what the options are for people trying to get on - and stay on - the property ladder .
in this climate of uncertainty , where the volatility of the stock market makes it hard to predict which way the property market is headed , the outlook for first-time buyers is pretty grim .
this is demonstrated by the stories in the series .
dawn decides to spend her summer camping in a queue for the chance to buy a house , and cathie , who at 36 still lives with her parents , opts to go online in a bid to find a stranger to buy with .
as record house prices and increasing interest rates are pushing people out of the property market , andrew assesses the economic factors which determine how much people pay for their mortgages .
andrew meets those who are feeling that they have totally overstretched themselves and , after borrowing seven times their salary , can they stay in the property market or is repossession around the corner ?
an increasing number of private companies now offer mortgage rescue schemes , promising to relieve homeowners of their financial burdens .
programme two in episode two of the series , andrew verity discovers that , while there are big winners , there are also big losers , and reveals some remarkable facts about the way the market works .
whether potential buyers feel they have hit the jackpot or high prices stand between them and their dream home , they still need to ask themselves if the property is a good investment .
in nicholina 's situation , her two sons are forced to share a bedroom with their grandmother because she has been priced out of moving up the ladder .
she bought a two-bedroom maisonette in london four years ago for £ 125,000 .
it is now worth £ 200,000 , but it is not enough to buy a three-bedroom house .
she has made money on paper , but not in reality .
andrew looks at some success stories , too .
george , who bought his council house in hackney 14 years ago for £ 37,000 and , following a sale , has just made a profit of half a million pounds , leaving scope for more investment .
programme three whilst more and more people believe they have missed out on the opportunity to get on the property ladder , andrew verity goes in search of alternative solutions to buying a house in the third and final part of the series .
dominic is a paramedic and feels he can not afford to buy in his area .
although his other job as a fireman increases his income to the point where it might be possible for him to buy , he must live within two miles of the fire station which limits his choices .
when his housing association offers him the opportunity to buy their home , dominic faces a very hard decision .
andrew also meets sarah who bought a piece of land with farm buildings on it .
by deciding to live in the building sarah breaks the planning laws and the local council have now threatened to throw her out .

seen by many as a potential candidate of the liberal democrat left , he is a firm believer in using technology to connect with voters .
mr webb 's facebook entry has more than 1,000 " friends " on it and the 42-year-old former academic has set up an email-and-texting service that allows him to consult with hundreds of people simultaneously .
his current job within the party is to produce the lib dem manifesto for the next general election .
' not very good ' mr webb is a genial , self-deprecating figure much-liked among lib dem activists , and is seen as more of a " social liberal " than a free marketeer , unlike some frontbenchers .
elected in 1997 to represent northavon , near bristol , mr webb increased his majority in 2001 and 2005 .
from 2003 to 2006 he was the party 's health spokesman .
like many politicians , mr webb studied philosophy , politics and economics at oxford university , but admits on his own website : " i dropped politics after a year , because i was n't very good at it . "
but , amid the joking , mr webb is seen as something of an intellectual at westminster .
a former economist at the institute for fiscal studies , he was appointed professor of social policy at bath university shortly before his election and has published several books and pamphlets on social security .
a christian , he has spoken out of favour of alleviating debt in the developing world and has attended cross-party prayer groups in the commons .
' support ' he lists his interests as pensions and benefit issues , as well as alleviating third world debt .
he has voted against id cards , and in favour of the hunting ban .
he is also a member of the parliamentary christian fellowship and says he regularly attends cross-party prayer groups in the house .
mr webb , who is married with two children , says he has enough support to launch a leadership bid .
despite being well known within the party , though , he is far from being a household name .
he says : " one bizarre spin-off of being ' third favourite as next leader of the lib dems ' is that for the first time in my life i was ' door-stepped ' this morning by a camera crew ... it 's a bit of a shock when you stumble bleary-eyed from your flat first thing in a morning to have a bright light shining in your face .
" i dread to think what time they arrived just on the off-chance of catching me as i left . "
mr webb must now ponder whether he wants to step more permanently into the political spotlight .

in a frank letter to the european commission president , seen by the bbc , he suggested that china took business in europe for granted .
china is now the eu 's biggest source of manufactured goods .
but mr mandelson said that tariff barriers and chinese interventions were limiting how much the eu sold to the asian giant - costing firms billions .
the letter added that the chinese were " procedurally obstructive " where dialogue had been set up .
' public pressure ' the eu sold more goods to switzerland than it did to china , the letter to jose manuel barroso said , adding that the trade deficit between the eu and china was growing at about £ 10m every hour .
we have to make sure that the public is satisfied that that trading relationship is being conducted on full and fair trade , otherwise we are going to be in trouble peter mandelson " the chinese juggernaut is , to some extent , out of control , " mr mandelson added .
the bbc 's jonny dymond , who has seen the letter , says that the trade commissioner 's letter " effectively accuses china of taking the mickey " .
" the message behind the letter looks pretty clear - that europe has rolled over long enough , " our reporter added .
separately , mr mandelson told the bbc that pressure from the public and politicians for a level playing-field of trade was growing .
" if we want to sustain a policy of openness towards china politically , we have to make sure that the public is satisfied that that trading relationship is being conducted on full and fair trade , otherwise we are going to be in trouble . "
china was " shifting the economic and diplomatic scenery so fast that it is almost impossible for policy makers to keep up let alone be ahead of the game " , he added .
" because of china 's extraordinary economic growth as well as its political and diplomatic reach , and the effect it can have on global security , we are seeing china changing the whole global landscape in so many different ways . "

the findings are contained in a report drawn up to advise ministers on the social impact of immigration .
the home office 's migration impacts forum is meeting to discuss the effect of eastern european workers .
on tuesday , ministers published a review of research showing " clear benefits " to the british economy .
the forum , which sits alongside a separate economist-led body , gathers reports on challenges raised by immigration across the country .
areas reporting concerns homelessness : e mids and scotland education : s west , e mids , north west gp caseload : sheffield and east mids a & e arrivals : east , lincs and southampton tensions : n west , s west and scotland migrants exploited : most areas note : report relies on anecdotal reports of problems compiled in eight regions of the uk .
regional consultation on impacts of migration -lsb- 669kb -rsb- most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader in a first review of the regional picture , the forum received anecdotal reports of pressures across five key areas : crime and disorder , community cohesion , health , education and housing .
the reports were compiled by regional groups including police , health and education officials .
five out of eight regions told whitehall they had seen " difficulties " relating to crime and education .
six of the eight said they were concerned about health service issues .
seven regions raised the issue of housing - although concerns appear to be focused on exploitation of migrants rather than pressure on accommodation .
all the regions asked for more information on movements of people , including those with children , so they could better plan public services .
' new balance ' the government 's office for national statistics has already said it is reviewing how it counts migration .
there were also concerns in some areas about an increase in low-level crimes such as driving offences , anti-social behaviour and community tensions .
immigration minister liam byrne said it was important to " strike a new balance " in immigration policy .
" that means looking at the wider benefits to the british economy on the one hand , but it means we have to take into account the wider impact on british public services and life as well .
" we need to weigh both things up before we take big decisions on immigration including whether to keep restrictions on bulgarian and romanian workers . "
more resources over the past year an increasing number of local authorities have raised concerns over immigration . "
this confirms what everyone knows but what labour have been in denial about - that immigration has a real impact on the housing and public service infrastructure " shadow home secretary david davis they say that while their areas have economically benefited from more workers , public services may be suffering if funding does not reflect how their areas are changing .
however , reports passed back to government suggested ways of minimising problems , including briefing packs on british society and laws , encouraging employers to provide english lessons and basic local council help with integrating into communities .
damian green , shadow minister for immigration , told the bbc that quotas were needed to balance economic benefits against social impact .
" we say of course you should look at the economics , at the effects on public services , on demand for housing , school places and so on , and that then the government should set an explicit limit every year , " he said .
migrants and the economy 12.5 % of working age population " clear benefits " to uk no effect on unemployment " modest negative " impact on lowest paid source : home office report migrants ' one eighth of workers ' dhananjayan sriskandarajah of the insitute of public policy research said it was time for government to move from anecdotal evidence to hard facts .
" it is clear that migration brings huge economic benefits to the uk , " said dr sriskandarajah .
" it is also clear that , although recent migration is presenting new challenges in areas which have received large numbers of newcomers , most local communities around the country are coping very well .
" the key for policymakers will be to tap into the economic potential of immigrants while designing public services that can meet the needs of changing and diverse populations . "
economic report on tuesday , the home office published a detailed report setting out the economic case for migration , saying all evidence pointed towards a " clear benefit " to the uk .
it said claims that eastern european workers had taken jobs from british people were unsubstantiated - instead they had contributed towards an expanding of the economy .
however , it added that some of the lowest paid workers can lose out in the face of cheaper foreign workers , even with the minimum wage in place .
but sir andrew green , chairman of migrationwatch uk , said migration on the scale britain was currently facing was having a " huge impact " with " little economic justification " .
he added the government must look at cutting the numbers of migrants from non-eu countries .
" you can not do anything about the eastern europeans because they are members of the eu and their numbers are likely to decline as the level of these economies come up , " he said .
" three quarters of migrants come from the rest of the world . "

the findings are contained in a report drawn up to advise ministers on the social impact of immigration .
the home office 's migration impacts forum is meeting to discuss the effect of eastern european workers .
on tuesday , ministers published a review of research showing " clear benefits " to the british economy .
the forum , which sits alongside a separate economist-led body , gathers reports on challenges raised by immigration across the country .

the reports were compiled by regional groups including police , health and education officials .
five out of eight regions told whitehall they had seen " difficulties " relating to crime and education .
six of the eight said they were concerned about health service issues .
seven regions raised the issue of housing - although concerns appear to be focused on exploitation of migrants rather than pressure on accommodation .
all the regions asked for more information on movements of people , including those with children , so they could better plan public services .
' new balance ' the government 's office for national statistics has already said it is reviewing how it counts migration .
there were also concerns in some areas about an increase in low-level crimes such as driving offences , anti-social behaviour and community tensions .
immigration minister liam byrne said it was important to " strike a new balance " in immigration policy .
" that means looking at the wider benefits to the british economy on the one hand , but it means we have to take into account the wider impact on british public services and life as well .
" we need to weigh both things up before we take big decisions on immigration including whether to keep restrictions on bulgarian and romanian workers . "
more resources over the past year an increasing number of local authorities have raised concerns over immigration .
this confirms what everyone knows but what labour have been in denial about - that immigration has a real impact on the housing and public service infrastructure shadow home secretary david davis they say that while their areas have economically benefited from more workers , public services may be suffering if funding does not reflect how their areas are changing .
however , reports passed back to government suggested ways of minimising problems , including briefing packs on british society and laws , encouraging employers to provide english lessons and basic local council help with integrating into communities .
damian green , shadow minister for immigration , told the bbc that quotas were needed to balance economic benefits against social impact .
" we say of course you should look at the economics , at the effects on public services , on demand for housing , school places and so on , and that then the government should set an explicit limit every year , " he said .
migrants and the economy 12.5 % of working age population " clear benefits " to uk no effect on unemployment " modest negative " impact on lowest paid source : home office report migrants ' one eighth of workers ' dhananjayan sriskandarajah of the insitute of public policy research said it was time for government to move from anecdotal evidence to hard facts .
" it is clear that migration brings huge economic benefits to the uk , " said dr sriskandarajah .
" it is also clear that , although recent migration is presenting new challenges in areas which have received large numbers of newcomers , most local communities around the country are coping very well .
" the key for policymakers will be to tap into the economic potential of immigrants while designing public services that can meet the needs of changing and diverse populations . "
economic report on tuesday , the home office published a detailed report setting out the economic case for migration , saying all evidence pointed towards a " clear benefit " to the uk .
it said claims that eastern european workers had taken jobs from british people were unsubstantiated - instead they had contributed towards an expanding of the economy .
however , it added that some of the lowest paid workers can lose out in the face of cheaper foreign workers , even with the minimum wage in place .
but sir andrew green , chairman of migrationwatch uk , said migration on the scale britain was currently facing was having a " huge impact " with " little economic justification " .
he added the government must look at cutting the numbers of migrants from non-eu countries .
" you can not do anything about the eastern europeans because they are members of the eu and their numbers are likely to decline as the level of these economies come up , " he said .
" three quarters of migrants come from the rest of the world . "

there were also concerns in some areas about an increase in low-level crimes such as driving offences , anti-social behaviour and community tensions .
immigration minister liam byrne said it was important to " strike a new balance " in immigration policy .
" that means looking at the wider benefits to the british economy on the one hand , but it means we have to take into account the wider impact on british public services and life as well .
" we need to weigh both things up before we take big decisions on immigration including whether to keep restrictions on bulgarian and romanian workers . "
more resources over the past year an increasing number of local authorities have raised concerns over immigration .
this confirms what everyone knows but what labour have been in denial about - that immigration has a real impact on the housing and public service infrastructure shadow home secretary david davis they say that while their areas have economically benefited from more workers , public services may be suffering if funding does not reflect how their areas are changing .
however , reports passed back to government suggested ways of minimising problems , including briefing packs on british society and laws , encouraging employers to provide english lessons and basic local council help with integrating into communities .
damian green , shadow minister for immigration , told the bbc that quotas were needed to balance economic benefits against social impact .
" we say of course you should look at the economics , at the effects on public services , on demand for housing , school places and so on , and that then the government should set an explicit limit every year , " he said .
migrants and the economy 12.5 % of working age population " clear benefits " to uk no effect on unemployment " modest negative " impact on lowest paid source : home office report migrants ' one eighth of workers ' dhananjayan sriskandarajah of the insitute of public policy research said it was time for government to move from anecdotal evidence to hard facts .
" it is clear that migration brings huge economic benefits to the uk , " said dr sriskandarajah .
" it is also clear that , although recent migration is presenting new challenges in areas which have received large numbers of newcomers , most local communities around the country are coping very well .
" the key for policymakers will be to tap into the economic potential of immigrants while designing public services that can meet the needs of changing and diverse populations . "
economic report on tuesday , the home office published a detailed report setting out the economic case for migration , saying all evidence pointed towards a " clear benefit " to the uk .
it said claims that eastern european workers had taken jobs from british people were unsubstantiated - instead they had contributed towards an expanding of the economy .
however , it added that some of the lowest paid workers can lose out in the face of cheaper foreign workers , even with the minimum wage in place .
but sir andrew green , chairman of migrationwatch uk , said migration on the scale britain was currently facing was having a " huge impact " with " little economic justification " .
he added the government must look at cutting the numbers of migrants from non-eu countries .
" you can not do anything about the eastern europeans because they are members of the eu and their numbers are likely to decline as the level of these economies come up , " he said .
" three quarters of migrants come from the rest of the world . "
