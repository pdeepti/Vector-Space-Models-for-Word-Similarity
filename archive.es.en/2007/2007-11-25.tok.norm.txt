program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 25.11.2007 bad web design proves a problem for blind internet users großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blind people need special software to surf the net the combination of the internet and computer screen reader software means blind people now have more access to written information than ever before .
but bad web design is making accessibility difficult . a folded white cane lies next to piles of papers and coffee cups on computer programmer günter christmann 's desk .
he is blind and ca n't actually see the written text on the computer screen in front of him . christmann opens up his internet browser using the keyboard curser and types in the name of the site he wants to visit - the tap of his fingers accompanied by a fast-talking robotic voice that fastidiously reads every single character displayed on the screen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet is a revolution for blind people given the amounts of advertisements , pictures , links and headings on a single internet page , it can sometimes take a while for a blind user to find the actual text that they want .
but according to christmann , even if it does take him longer to find what he wants , it 's worth it . information on the net previously , if christmann wanted to read a newspaper , he had to wait for it to be scanned into braille , which meant the reports were already days old . " nowadays , with internet , i can go to the newspaper or magazine and i can read the newspaper directly , " he said . the internet has an even more practical side .
before the advent of the net , christmann had to wait for someone to scan in his computer manuals so he could do his work . " now , i can search with google and find everything i need , " he said .
" i can find more information that i ever dreamt of . " there are several types of screen reader software that europe 's 2.7 million blind people can use if they have computer access .
most of these programs can easily switch between the major european languages written in the roman script . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis braille invented the six dot script for the blind sounds good so far , but there are digital roadblocks , such as when german programmers use german expressions to describe drop down boxes and form fields in an english web site . this is what christmann found when he tested the dw-world 's english page , a problem he comes across often throughout the internet .
a pure english speaker surfing the page would have been stuck .
new portable software christmannn works as a product manager for baum retec , a german firm based near the southern german city of heidelberg specializing in products and services for the blind and visually impaired . one of the products he supports is mystick , a screen reader packed into a normal usb stick in u3 technology that is making computers and the internet even more accessible for the blind . because it is portable , mystick means blind users can log onto any pc running windows , and start using the programs and surfing the internet without having to engage in the arduous process of installing software first .
" i can go to a library or an internet café and plug in mystick and start using the screen reader , " christmann said .
when he 's finished , he just takes out the usb stick , and puts it in his pocket . high-tech electronics in addition to the screen reader , another piece of equipment that 's essential for blind people who use the computer for work is a braille display .
it 's made up of a long row of so-called " soft cells " that are each made up of six to eight tiny metal or nylon pins , which are controlled electronically and move up and down to spell out a line of text in braille . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a braille display costs around 12,000 euro " just because i can hear the words , does n't mean i know how to write them , " explained anna courtpozanis , who has been blind since birth -lrb- which has n't stopped her gaining a degree , having a family , and working full-time -rrb- . " if i write texts , i need to see if i have made a mistake , " she said , as her fingers flew over the braille line .
" at home , i have a computer without braille and it 's more difficult to work there . "
courtpozanis tests web sites to see how accessible they are for web for all , a heidelberg-based non-profit association aiming to reduce barriers for people using the internet . it can take new users a while to learn the numerous keyboard commands that are necessary for using a screen reader or a braille line .
according to courtpozanis , however , the main barrier to web use is poor web design . descriptive text a must pictures are often a barrier because unless a descriptive text is provided , a blind person has no way of knowing whether the image is an unidentified photo or logo , artwork , a link to another page or something else .
videos and animated elements are also problematic for the same reason . courtpozanis personally finds online forms particularly annoying simply because they are an unavoidable part of daily existence but often have no description of what particular field is for . " if i want my daughter 's birth certificate but i have n't got time to go to the town where she 's born , then i have to do it over the net , but i ca n't fill in the forms , " she complained .
courtpozanis and christmann are both what you would call power internet users .
and both of them are irritated that with all the investment in high-tech software and technology , it 's the simple things - a lack of descriptive words , for instance - that can render a website meaningless for the blind . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but bad web design is making accessibility difficult . a folded white cane lies next to piles of papers and coffee cups on computer programmer günter christmann 's desk .
he is blind and ca n't actually see the written text on the computer screen in front of him . christmann opens up his internet browser using the keyboard curser and types in the name of the site he wants to visit - the tap of his fingers accompanied by a fast-talking robotic voice that fastidiously reads every single character displayed on the screen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet is a revolution for blind people given the amounts of advertisements , pictures , links and headings on a single internet page , it can sometimes take a while for a blind user to find the actual text that they want .
but according to christmann , even if it does take him longer to find what he wants , it 's worth it . information on the net previously , if christmann wanted to read a newspaper , he had to wait for it to be scanned into braille , which meant the reports were already days old . " nowadays , with internet , i can go to the newspaper or magazine and i can read the newspaper directly , " he said . the internet has an even more practical side .
before the advent of the net , christmann had to wait for someone to scan in his computer manuals so he could do his work . " now , i can search with google and find everything i need , " he said .
" i can find more information that i ever dreamt of . " there are several types of screen reader software that europe 's 2.7 million blind people can use if they have computer access .
most of these programs can easily switch between the major european languages written in the roman script . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis braille invented the six dot script for the blind sounds good so far , but there are digital roadblocks , such as when german programmers use german expressions to describe drop down boxes and form fields in an english web site . this is what christmann found when he tested the dw-world 's english page , a problem he comes across often throughout the internet .
a pure english speaker surfing the page would have been stuck .
new portable software christmannn works as a product manager for baum retec , a german firm based near the southern german city of heidelberg specializing in products and services for the blind and visually impaired . one of the products he supports is mystick , a screen reader packed into a normal usb stick in u3 technology that is making computers and the internet even more accessible for the blind . because it is portable , mystick means blind users can log onto any pc running windows , and start using the programs and surfing the internet without having to engage in the arduous process of installing software first .
" i can go to a library or an internet café and plug in mystick and start using the screen reader , " christmann said .
when he 's finished , he just takes out the usb stick , and puts it in his pocket . high-tech electronics in addition to the screen reader , another piece of equipment that 's essential for blind people who use the computer for work is a braille display .
it 's made up of a long row of so-called " soft cells " that are each made up of six to eight tiny metal or nylon pins , which are controlled electronically and move up and down to spell out a line of text in braille . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a braille display costs around 12,000 euro " just because i can hear the words , does n't mean i know how to write them , " explained anna courtpozanis , who has been blind since birth -lrb- which has n't stopped her gaining a degree , having a family , and working full-time -rrb- . " if i write texts , i need to see if i have made a mistake , " she said , as her fingers flew over the braille line .
" at home , i have a computer without braille and it 's more difficult to work there . "
courtpozanis tests web sites to see how accessible they are for web for all , a heidelberg-based non-profit association aiming to reduce barriers for people using the internet . it can take new users a while to learn the numerous keyboard commands that are necessary for using a screen reader or a braille line .
according to courtpozanis , however , the main barrier to web use is poor web design . descriptive text a must pictures are often a barrier because unless a descriptive text is provided , a blind person has no way of knowing whether the image is an unidentified photo or logo , artwork , a link to another page or something else .
videos and animated elements are also problematic for the same reason . courtpozanis personally finds online forms particularly annoying simply because they are an unavoidable part of daily existence but often have no description of what particular field is for . " if i want my daughter 's birth certificate but i have n't got time to go to the town where she 's born , then i have to do it over the net , but i ca n't fill in the forms , " she complained .
courtpozanis and christmann are both what you would call power internet users .
and both of them are irritated that with all the investment in high-tech software and technology , it 's the simple things - a lack of descriptive words , for instance - that can render a website meaningless for the blind . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 . the party , in opposition since the september 2005 elections , backtracked from the market reform policies introduced under the last government , when it was the junior partner in social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition .
some 800 party delegates backed a motion for 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- a year in increased state expenditure in payments to the unemployed , on education and on child support .
at the same time , however , the party base voted by 59 percent to reject a plan to pay a basic income to everyone in germany , irrespective of whether they worked or not .
opponents of the more radical proposal said it would cost 1 trillion euros a year .
party leaders reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth were expected to resign if it had been passed .
strengthened in opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer believes the greens are now better prepared for the political arena bütikofer said the party had emerged from its congress halfway through germany 's electoral cycle " strengthened in opposition , strengthened in its capacity to govern . "
" if we wish our policy to have weight in society , it must be visionary and ambitious , but most of all politically practicable , " bütikofer told rank-and-file members .
the greens have been struggling to profile themselves as an opposition party , especially after the departure of their charismatic leader joschka fischer in 2005 .
the party 's repositioning on the german political scene is important because of the effect it may have on the coalition calculations in both the upcoming state elections next year and the 2009 general elections .
the rejection of the basic income proposal came as a relief to the greens ' leadership , which was seriously challenged at a special assembly two months ago when grassroots members - going back to their traditionally pacifist roots - voted down a leadership motion for continued support of the german military presence in afghanistan .
less surveillance , more freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charismatic joschka fischer was foreign minister under gerhard schröder greens delegates also rejected moves promoted by christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- interior minister wolfgang schäuble to increase police powers to monitor computers online , warning against a " preventive surveillance state " to counter the threat of terrorism .
in a shift to the left , the party staked out a position that combined environmental concerns with social policies .
it said it aimed to pay for the increased spending by increasing incomes taxes at the top end , raising inheritance taxes and closing tax loopholes .
germany faces important state elections next year .
at a federal level , chancellor angela merkel 's unwieldy grand coalition , combining her conservative christian cdu / csu bloc with the spd , is thought likely to survive until the september 2009 elections .

25 . the party , in opposition since the september 2005 elections , backtracked from the market reform policies introduced under the last government , when it was the junior partner in social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition .
some 800 party delegates backed a motion for 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- a year in increased state expenditure in payments to the unemployed , on education and on child support .
at the same time , however , the party base voted by 59 percent to reject a plan to pay a basic income to everyone in germany , irrespective of whether they worked or not .
opponents of the more radical proposal said it would cost 1 trillion euros a year .
party leaders reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth were expected to resign if it had been passed .

"
" if we wish our policy to have weight in society , it must be visionary and ambitious , but most of all politically practicable , " bütikofer told rank-and-file members .
the greens have been struggling to profile themselves as an opposition party , especially after the departure of their charismatic leader joschka fischer in 2005 .
the party 's repositioning on the german political scene is important because of the effect it may have on the coalition calculations in both the upcoming state elections next year and the 2009 general elections .
the rejection of the basic income proposal came as a relief to the greens ' leadership , which was seriously challenged at a special assembly two months ago when grassroots members - going back to their traditionally pacifist roots - voted down a leadership motion for continued support of the german military presence in afghanistan .
less surveillance , more freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charismatic joschka fischer was foreign minister under gerhard schröder greens delegates also rejected moves promoted by christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- interior minister wolfgang schäuble to increase police powers to monitor computers online , warning against a " preventive surveillance state " to counter the threat of terrorism .

germany faces important state elections next year .

but bad web design is making accessibility difficult . a folded white cane lies next to piles of papers and coffee cups on computer programmer günter christmann 's desk .
he is blind and ca n't actually see the written text on the computer screen in front of him . christmann opens up his internet browser using the keyboard curser and types in the name of the site he wants to visit - the tap of his fingers accompanied by a fast-talking robotic voice that fastidiously reads every single character displayed on the screen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet is a revolution for blind people given the amounts of advertisements , pictures , links and headings on a single internet page , it can sometimes take a while for a blind user to find the actual text that they want .
but according to christmann , even if it does take him longer to find what he wants , it 's worth it . information on the net previously , if christmann wanted to read a newspaper , he had to wait for it to be scanned into braille , which meant the reports were already days old . " nowadays , with internet , i can go to the newspaper or magazine and i can read the newspaper directly , " he said . the internet has an even more practical side .
before the advent of the net , christmann had to wait for someone to scan in his computer manuals so he could do his work . " now , i can search with google and find everything i need , " he said .
" i can find more information that i ever dreamt of . " there are several types of screen reader software that europe 's 2.7 million blind people can use if they have computer access .
most of these programs can easily switch between the major european languages written in the roman script . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis braille invented the six dot script for the blind sounds good so far , but there are digital roadblocks , such as when german programmers use german expressions to describe drop down boxes and form fields in an english web site . this is what christmann found when he tested the dw-world 's english page , a problem he comes across often throughout the internet .
a pure english speaker surfing the page would have been stuck .
new portable software christmannn works as a product manager for baum retec , a german firm based near the southern german city of heidelberg specializing in products and services for the blind and visually impaired . one of the products he supports is mystick , a screen reader packed into a normal usb stick in u3 technology that is making computers and the internet even more accessible for the blind . because it is portable , mystick means blind users can log onto any pc running windows , and start using the programs and surfing the internet without having to engage in the arduous process of installing software first .
" i can go to a library or an internet café and plug in mystick and start using the screen reader , " christmann said .
when he 's finished , he just takes out the usb stick , and puts it in his pocket . high-tech electronics in addition to the screen reader , another piece of equipment that 's essential for blind people who use the computer for work is a braille display .
it 's made up of a long row of so-called " soft cells " that are each made up of six to eight tiny metal or nylon pins , which are controlled electronically and move up and down to spell out a line of text in braille . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a braille display costs around 12,000 euro " just because i can hear the words , does n't mean i know how to write them , " explained anna courtpozanis , who has been blind since birth -lrb- which has n't stopped her gaining a degree , having a family , and working full-time -rrb- . " if i write texts , i need to see if i have made a mistake , " she said , as her fingers flew over the braille line .
" at home , i have a computer without braille and it 's more difficult to work there . "
courtpozanis tests web sites to see how accessible they are for web for all , a heidelberg-based non-profit association aiming to reduce barriers for people using the internet . it can take new users a while to learn the numerous keyboard commands that are necessary for using a screen reader or a braille line .
according to courtpozanis , however , the main barrier to web use is poor web design . descriptive text a must pictures are often a barrier because unless a descriptive text is provided , a blind person has no way of knowing whether the image is an unidentified photo or logo , artwork , a link to another page or something else .
videos and animated elements are also problematic for the same reason . courtpozanis personally finds online forms particularly annoying simply because they are an unavoidable part of daily existence but often have no description of what particular field is for . " if i want my daughter 's birth certificate but i have n't got time to go to the town where she 's born , then i have to do it over the net , but i ca n't fill in the forms , " she complained .
courtpozanis and christmann are both what you would call power internet users .
and both of them are irritated that with all the investment in high-tech software and technology , it 's the simple things - a lack of descriptive words , for instance - that can render a website meaningless for the blind . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but bad web design is making accessibility difficult . a folded white cane lies next to piles of papers and coffee cups on computer programmer günter christmann 's desk .
he is blind and ca n't actually see the written text on the computer screen in front of him . christmann opens up his internet browser using the keyboard curser and types in the name of the site he wants to visit - the tap of his fingers accompanied by a fast-talking robotic voice that fastidiously reads every single character displayed on the screen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet is a revolution for blind people given the amounts of advertisements , pictures , links and headings on a single internet page , it can sometimes take a while for a blind user to find the actual text that they want .
but according to christmann , even if it does take him longer to find what he wants , it 's worth it . information on the net previously , if christmann wanted to read a newspaper , he had to wait for it to be scanned into braille , which meant the reports were already days old . " nowadays , with internet , i can go to the newspaper or magazine and i can read the newspaper directly , " he said . the internet has an even more practical side .
before the advent of the net , christmann had to wait for someone to scan in his computer manuals so he could do his work . " now , i can search with google and find everything i need , " he said .
" i can find more information that i ever dreamt of . " there are several types of screen reader software that europe 's 2.7 million blind people can use if they have computer access .
most of these programs can easily switch between the major european languages written in the roman script . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis braille invented the six dot script for the blind sounds good so far , but there are digital roadblocks , such as when german programmers use german expressions to describe drop down boxes and form fields in an english web site . this is what christmann found when he tested the dw-world 's english page , a problem he comes across often throughout the internet .
a pure english speaker surfing the page would have been stuck .
new portable software christmannn works as a product manager for baum retec , a german firm based near the southern german city of heidelberg specializing in products and services for the blind and visually impaired . one of the products he supports is mystick , a screen reader packed into a normal usb stick in u3 technology that is making computers and the internet even more accessible for the blind . because it is portable , mystick means blind users can log onto any pc running windows , and start using the programs and surfing the internet without having to engage in the arduous process of installing software first .
" i can go to a library or an internet café and plug in mystick and start using the screen reader , " christmann said .
when he 's finished , he just takes out the usb stick , and puts it in his pocket . high-tech electronics in addition to the screen reader , another piece of equipment that 's essential for blind people who use the computer for work is a braille display .
it 's made up of a long row of so-called " soft cells " that are each made up of six to eight tiny metal or nylon pins , which are controlled electronically and move up and down to spell out a line of text in braille . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a braille display costs around 12,000 euro " just because i can hear the words , does n't mean i know how to write them , " explained anna courtpozanis , who has been blind since birth -lrb- which has n't stopped her gaining a degree , having a family , and working full-time -rrb- . " if i write texts , i need to see if i have made a mistake , " she said , as her fingers flew over the braille line .
" at home , i have a computer without braille and it 's more difficult to work there . "
courtpozanis tests web sites to see how accessible they are for web for all , a heidelberg-based non-profit association aiming to reduce barriers for people using the internet . it can take new users a while to learn the numerous keyboard commands that are necessary for using a screen reader or a braille line .
according to courtpozanis , however , the main barrier to web use is poor web design . descriptive text a must pictures are often a barrier because unless a descriptive text is provided , a blind person has no way of knowing whether the image is an unidentified photo or logo , artwork , a link to another page or something else .
videos and animated elements are also problematic for the same reason . courtpozanis personally finds online forms particularly annoying simply because they are an unavoidable part of daily existence but often have no description of what particular field is for . " if i want my daughter 's birth certificate but i have n't got time to go to the town where she 's born , then i have to do it over the net , but i ca n't fill in the forms , " she complained .
courtpozanis and christmann are both what you would call power internet users .
and both of them are irritated that with all the investment in high-tech software and technology , it 's the simple things - a lack of descriptive words , for instance - that can render a website meaningless for the blind . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 800 party delegates backed a motion for 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- a year in increased state expenditure in payments to the unemployed , on education and on child support .
at the same time , however , the party base voted by 59 percent to reject a plan to pay a basic income to everyone in germany , irrespective of whether they worked or not .
opponents of the more radical proposal said it would cost 1 trillion euros a year .
party leaders reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth were expected to resign if it had been passed .

"
" if we wish our policy to have weight in society , it must be visionary and ambitious , but most of all politically practicable , " bütikofer told rank-and-file members .
the greens have been struggling to profile themselves as an opposition party , especially after the departure of their charismatic leader joschka fischer in 2005 .
the party 's repositioning on the german political scene is important because of the effect it may have on the coalition calculations in both the upcoming state elections next year and the 2009 general elections .
the rejection of the basic income proposal came as a relief to the greens ' leadership , which was seriously challenged at a special assembly two months ago when grassroots members - going back to their traditionally pacifist roots - voted down a leadership motion for continued support of the german military presence in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 25.11.2007 bad web design proves a problem for blind internet users großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blind people need special software to surf the net the combination of the internet and computer screen reader software means blind people now have more access to written information than ever before .
but bad web design is making accessibility difficult . a folded white cane lies next to piles of papers and coffee cups on computer programmer günter christmann 's desk .
he is blind and ca n't actually see the written text on the computer screen in front of him . christmann opens up his internet browser using the keyboard curser and types in the name of the site he wants to visit - the tap of his fingers accompanied by a fast-talking robotic voice that fastidiously reads every single character displayed on the screen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet is a revolution for blind people given the amounts of advertisements , pictures , links and headings on a single internet page , it can sometimes take a while for a blind user to find the actual text that they want .
but according to christmann , even if it does take him longer to find what he wants , it 's worth it . information on the net previously , if christmann wanted to read a newspaper , he had to wait for it to be scanned into braille , which meant the reports were already days old . " nowadays , with internet , i can go to the newspaper or magazine and i can read the newspaper directly , " he said . the internet has an even more practical side .
before the advent of the net , christmann had to wait for someone to scan in his computer manuals so he could do his work . " now , i can search with google and find everything i need , " he said .
" i can find more information that i ever dreamt of . " there are several types of screen reader software that europe 's 2.7 million blind people can use if they have computer access .
most of these programs can easily switch between the major european languages written in the roman script . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis braille invented the six dot script for the blind sounds good so far , but there are digital roadblocks , such as when german programmers use german expressions to describe drop down boxes and form fields in an english web site . this is what christmann found when he tested the dw-world 's english page , a problem he comes across often throughout the internet .
a pure english speaker surfing the page would have been stuck .
new portable software christmannn works as a product manager for baum retec , a german firm based near the southern german city of heidelberg specializing in products and services for the blind and visually impaired . one of the products he supports is mystick , a screen reader packed into a normal usb stick in u3 technology that is making computers and the internet even more accessible for the blind . because it is portable , mystick means blind users can log onto any pc running windows , and start using the programs and surfing the internet without having to engage in the arduous process of installing software first .
" i can go to a library or an internet café and plug in mystick and start using the screen reader , " christmann said .
when he 's finished , he just takes out the usb stick , and puts it in his pocket . high-tech electronics in addition to the screen reader , another piece of equipment that 's essential for blind people who use the computer for work is a braille display .
it 's made up of a long row of so-called " soft cells " that are each made up of six to eight tiny metal or nylon pins , which are controlled electronically and move up and down to spell out a line of text in braille . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a braille display costs around 12,000 euro " just because i can hear the words , does n't mean i know how to write them , " explained anna courtpozanis , who has been blind since birth -lrb- which has n't stopped her gaining a degree , having a family , and working full-time -rrb- . " if i write texts , i need to see if i have made a mistake , " she said , as her fingers flew over the braille line .
" at home , i have a computer without braille and it 's more difficult to work there . "
courtpozanis tests web sites to see how accessible they are for web for all , a heidelberg-based non-profit association aiming to reduce barriers for people using the internet . it can take new users a while to learn the numerous keyboard commands that are necessary for using a screen reader or a braille line .
according to courtpozanis , however , the main barrier to web use is poor web design . descriptive text a must pictures are often a barrier because unless a descriptive text is provided , a blind person has no way of knowing whether the image is an unidentified photo or logo , artwork , a link to another page or something else .
videos and animated elements are also problematic for the same reason . courtpozanis personally finds online forms particularly annoying simply because they are an unavoidable part of daily existence but often have no description of what particular field is for . " if i want my daughter 's birth certificate but i have n't got time to go to the town where she 's born , then i have to do it over the net , but i ca n't fill in the forms , " she complained .
courtpozanis and christmann are both what you would call power internet users .
and both of them are irritated that with all the investment in high-tech software and technology , it 's the simple things - a lack of descriptive words , for instance - that can render a website meaningless for the blind . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 25.11.2007 germany 's greens turn left , avoiding radical motions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party has been struggling to find the right direction germany 's greens voted in favor of extending social benefits but rejected a proposal that would guarantee a basic income to everyone at a key party congress that ended in the city of nuremberg on sunday , nov .
25 . the party , in opposition since the september 2005 elections , backtracked from the market reform policies introduced under the last government , when it was the junior partner in social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition .
some 800 party delegates backed a motion for 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- a year in increased state expenditure in payments to the unemployed , on education and on child support .
at the same time , however , the party base voted by 59 percent to reject a plan to pay a basic income to everyone in germany , irrespective of whether they worked or not .
opponents of the more radical proposal said it would cost 1 trillion euros a year .
party leaders reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth were expected to resign if it had been passed .
strengthened in opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer believes the greens are now better prepared for the political arena bütikofer said the party had emerged from its congress halfway through germany 's electoral cycle " strengthened in opposition , strengthened in its capacity to govern . "
" if we wish our policy to have weight in society , it must be visionary and ambitious , but most of all politically practicable , " bütikofer told rank-and-file members .
the greens have been struggling to profile themselves as an opposition party , especially after the departure of their charismatic leader joschka fischer in 2005 .
the party 's repositioning on the german political scene is important because of the effect it may have on the coalition calculations in both the upcoming state elections next year and the 2009 general elections .
the rejection of the basic income proposal came as a relief to the greens ' leadership , which was seriously challenged at a special assembly two months ago when grassroots members - going back to their traditionally pacifist roots - voted down a leadership motion for continued support of the german military presence in afghanistan .
less surveillance , more freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charismatic joschka fischer was foreign minister under gerhard schröder greens delegates also rejected moves promoted by christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- interior minister wolfgang schäuble to increase police powers to monitor computers online , warning against a " preventive surveillance state " to counter the threat of terrorism .
in a shift to the left , the party staked out a position that combined environmental concerns with social policies .
it said it aimed to pay for the increased spending by increasing incomes taxes at the top end , raising inheritance taxes and closing tax loopholes .
germany faces important state elections next year .
at a federal level , chancellor angela merkel 's unwieldy grand coalition , combining her conservative christian cdu / csu bloc with the spd , is thought likely to survive until the september 2009 elections .
a recent poll gave the cdu / csu 40 per cent , the spd 24 , the left 12 , the greens 9 and the market-liberal fdp 9 percent of the national vote . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 25.11.2007 bad web design proves a problem for blind internet users großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blind people need special software to surf the net the combination of the internet and computer screen reader software means blind people now have more access to written information than ever before .
but bad web design is making accessibility difficult . a folded white cane lies next to piles of papers and coffee cups on computer programmer günter christmann 's desk .
he is blind and ca n't actually see the written text on the computer screen in front of him . christmann opens up his internet browser using the keyboard curser and types in the name of the site he wants to visit - the tap of his fingers accompanied by a fast-talking robotic voice that fastidiously reads every single character displayed on the screen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet is a revolution for blind people given the amounts of advertisements , pictures , links and headings on a single internet page , it can sometimes take a while for a blind user to find the actual text that they want .
but according to christmann , even if it does take him longer to find what he wants , it 's worth it . information on the net previously , if christmann wanted to read a newspaper , he had to wait for it to be scanned into braille , which meant the reports were already days old . " nowadays , with internet , i can go to the newspaper or magazine and i can read the newspaper directly , " he said . the internet has an even more practical side .
before the advent of the net , christmann had to wait for someone to scan in his computer manuals so he could do his work . " now , i can search with google and find everything i need , " he said .
" i can find more information that i ever dreamt of . " there are several types of screen reader software that europe 's 2.7 million blind people can use if they have computer access .
most of these programs can easily switch between the major european languages written in the roman script . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis braille invented the six dot script for the blind sounds good so far , but there are digital roadblocks , such as when german programmers use german expressions to describe drop down boxes and form fields in an english web site . this is what christmann found when he tested the dw-world 's english page , a problem he comes across often throughout the internet .
a pure english speaker surfing the page would have been stuck .
new portable software christmannn works as a product manager for baum retec , a german firm based near the southern german city of heidelberg specializing in products and services for the blind and visually impaired . one of the products he supports is mystick , a screen reader packed into a normal usb stick in u3 technology that is making computers and the internet even more accessible for the blind . because it is portable , mystick means blind users can log onto any pc running windows , and start using the programs and surfing the internet without having to engage in the arduous process of installing software first .
" i can go to a library or an internet café and plug in mystick and start using the screen reader , " christmann said .
when he 's finished , he just takes out the usb stick , and puts it in his pocket . high-tech electronics in addition to the screen reader , another piece of equipment that 's essential for blind people who use the computer for work is a braille display .
it 's made up of a long row of so-called " soft cells " that are each made up of six to eight tiny metal or nylon pins , which are controlled electronically and move up and down to spell out a line of text in braille . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a braille display costs around 12,000 euro " just because i can hear the words , does n't mean i know how to write them , " explained anna courtpozanis , who has been blind since birth -lrb- which has n't stopped her gaining a degree , having a family , and working full-time -rrb- . " if i write texts , i need to see if i have made a mistake , " she said , as her fingers flew over the braille line .
" at home , i have a computer without braille and it 's more difficult to work there . "
courtpozanis tests web sites to see how accessible they are for web for all , a heidelberg-based non-profit association aiming to reduce barriers for people using the internet . it can take new users a while to learn the numerous keyboard commands that are necessary for using a screen reader or a braille line .
according to courtpozanis , however , the main barrier to web use is poor web design . descriptive text a must pictures are often a barrier because unless a descriptive text is provided , a blind person has no way of knowing whether the image is an unidentified photo or logo , artwork , a link to another page or something else .
videos and animated elements are also problematic for the same reason . courtpozanis personally finds online forms particularly annoying simply because they are an unavoidable part of daily existence but often have no description of what particular field is for .

25 . the party , in opposition since the september 2005 elections , backtracked from the market reform policies introduced under the last government , when it was the junior partner in social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition .
some 800 party delegates backed a motion for 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- a year in increased state expenditure in payments to the unemployed , on education and on child support .
at the same time , however , the party base voted by 59 percent to reject a plan to pay a basic income to everyone in germany , irrespective of whether they worked or not .
opponents of the more radical proposal said it would cost 1 trillion euros a year .
party leaders reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth were expected to resign if it had been passed .
strengthened in opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer believes the greens are now better prepared for the political arena bütikofer said the party had emerged from its congress halfway through germany 's electoral cycle " strengthened in opposition , strengthened in its capacity to govern . "
" if we wish our policy to have weight in society , it must be visionary and ambitious , but most of all politically practicable , " bütikofer told rank-and-file members .
the greens have been struggling to profile themselves as an opposition party , especially after the departure of their charismatic leader joschka fischer in 2005 .
the party 's repositioning on the german political scene is important because of the effect it may have on the coalition calculations in both the upcoming state elections next year and the 2009 general elections .
the rejection of the basic income proposal came as a relief to the greens ' leadership , which was seriously challenged at a special assembly two months ago when grassroots members - going back to their traditionally pacifist roots - voted down a leadership motion for continued support of the german military presence in afghanistan .
less surveillance , more freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charismatic joschka fischer was foreign minister under gerhard schröder greens delegates also rejected moves promoted by christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- interior minister wolfgang schäuble to increase police powers to monitor computers online , warning against a " preventive surveillance state " to counter the threat of terrorism .
in a shift to the left , the party staked out a position that combined environmental concerns with social policies .
it said it aimed to pay for the increased spending by increasing incomes taxes at the top end , raising inheritance taxes and closing tax loopholes .
germany faces important state elections next year .
at a federal level , chancellor angela merkel 's unwieldy grand coalition , combining her conservative christian cdu / csu bloc with the spd , is thought likely to survive until the september 2009 elections .
a recent poll gave the cdu / csu 40 per cent , the spd 24 , the left 12 , the greens 9 and the market-liberal fdp 9 percent of the national vote . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but bad web design is making accessibility difficult . a folded white cane lies next to piles of papers and coffee cups on computer programmer günter christmann 's desk .
he is blind and ca n't actually see the written text on the computer screen in front of him . christmann opens up his internet browser using the keyboard curser and types in the name of the site he wants to visit - the tap of his fingers accompanied by a fast-talking robotic voice that fastidiously reads every single character displayed on the screen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet is a revolution for blind people given the amounts of advertisements , pictures , links and headings on a single internet page , it can sometimes take a while for a blind user to find the actual text that they want .
but according to christmann , even if it does take him longer to find what he wants , it 's worth it . information on the net previously , if christmann wanted to read a newspaper , he had to wait for it to be scanned into braille , which meant the reports were already days old . " nowadays , with internet , i can go to the newspaper or magazine and i can read the newspaper directly , " he said . the internet has an even more practical side .
before the advent of the net , christmann had to wait for someone to scan in his computer manuals so he could do his work . " now , i can search with google and find everything i need , " he said .
" i can find more information that i ever dreamt of . " there are several types of screen reader software that europe 's 2.7 million blind people can use if they have computer access .
most of these programs can easily switch between the major european languages written in the roman script . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis braille invented the six dot script for the blind sounds good so far , but there are digital roadblocks , such as when german programmers use german expressions to describe drop down boxes and form fields in an english web site . this is what christmann found when he tested the dw-world 's english page , a problem he comes across often throughout the internet .
a pure english speaker surfing the page would have been stuck .
new portable software christmannn works as a product manager for baum retec , a german firm based near the southern german city of heidelberg specializing in products and services for the blind and visually impaired . one of the products he supports is mystick , a screen reader packed into a normal usb stick in u3 technology that is making computers and the internet even more accessible for the blind . because it is portable , mystick means blind users can log onto any pc running windows , and start using the programs and surfing the internet without having to engage in the arduous process of installing software first .
" i can go to a library or an internet café and plug in mystick and start using the screen reader , " christmann said .
when he 's finished , he just takes out the usb stick , and puts it in his pocket . high-tech electronics in addition to the screen reader , another piece of equipment that 's essential for blind people who use the computer for work is a braille display .
it 's made up of a long row of so-called " soft cells " that are each made up of six to eight tiny metal or nylon pins , which are controlled electronically and move up and down to spell out a line of text in braille . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a braille display costs around 12,000 euro " just because i can hear the words , does n't mean i know how to write them , " explained anna courtpozanis , who has been blind since birth -lrb- which has n't stopped her gaining a degree , having a family , and working full-time -rrb- . " if i write texts , i need to see if i have made a mistake , " she said , as her fingers flew over the braille line .
" at home , i have a computer without braille and it 's more difficult to work there . "

but bad web design is making accessibility difficult . a folded white cane lies next to piles of papers and coffee cups on computer programmer günter christmann 's desk .
he is blind and ca n't actually see the written text on the computer screen in front of him . christmann opens up his internet browser using the keyboard curser and types in the name of the site he wants to visit - the tap of his fingers accompanied by a fast-talking robotic voice that fastidiously reads every single character displayed on the screen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet is a revolution for blind people given the amounts of advertisements , pictures , links and headings on a single internet page , it can sometimes take a while for a blind user to find the actual text that they want .
but according to christmann , even if it does take him longer to find what he wants , it 's worth it . information on the net previously , if christmann wanted to read a newspaper , he had to wait for it to be scanned into braille , which meant the reports were already days old . " nowadays , with internet , i can go to the newspaper or magazine and i can read the newspaper directly , " he said . the internet has an even more practical side .
before the advent of the net , christmann had to wait for someone to scan in his computer manuals so he could do his work . " now , i can search with google and find everything i need , " he said .
" i can find more information that i ever dreamt of . " there are several types of screen reader software that europe 's 2.7 million blind people can use if they have computer access .
most of these programs can easily switch between the major european languages written in the roman script . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis braille invented the six dot script for the blind sounds good so far , but there are digital roadblocks , such as when german programmers use german expressions to describe drop down boxes and form fields in an english web site . this is what christmann found when he tested the dw-world 's english page , a problem he comes across often throughout the internet .
a pure english speaker surfing the page would have been stuck .
new portable software christmannn works as a product manager for baum retec , a german firm based near the southern german city of heidelberg specializing in products and services for the blind and visually impaired . one of the products he supports is mystick , a screen reader packed into a normal usb stick in u3 technology that is making computers and the internet even more accessible for the blind . because it is portable , mystick means blind users can log onto any pc running windows , and start using the programs and surfing the internet without having to engage in the arduous process of installing software first .
" i can go to a library or an internet café and plug in mystick and start using the screen reader , " christmann said .
when he 's finished , he just takes out the usb stick , and puts it in his pocket . high-tech electronics in addition to the screen reader , another piece of equipment that 's essential for blind people who use the computer for work is a braille display .
it 's made up of a long row of so-called " soft cells " that are each made up of six to eight tiny metal or nylon pins , which are controlled electronically and move up and down to spell out a line of text in braille . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a braille display costs around 12,000 euro " just because i can hear the words , does n't mean i know how to write them , " explained anna courtpozanis , who has been blind since birth -lrb- which has n't stopped her gaining a degree , having a family , and working full-time -rrb- . " if i write texts , i need to see if i have made a mistake , " she said , as her fingers flew over the braille line .
" at home , i have a computer without braille and it 's more difficult to work there . "
courtpozanis tests web sites to see how accessible they are for web for all , a heidelberg-based non-profit association aiming to reduce barriers for people using the internet . it can take new users a while to learn the numerous keyboard commands that are necessary for using a screen reader or a braille line .
according to courtpozanis , however , the main barrier to web use is poor web design . descriptive text a must pictures are often a barrier because unless a descriptive text is provided , a blind person has no way of knowing whether the image is an unidentified photo or logo , artwork , a link to another page or something else .
videos and animated elements are also problematic for the same reason . courtpozanis personally finds online forms particularly annoying simply because they are an unavoidable part of daily existence but often have no description of what particular field is for . " if i want my daughter 's birth certificate but i have n't got time to go to the town where she 's born , then i have to do it over the net , but i ca n't fill in the forms , " she complained .
courtpozanis and christmann are both what you would call power internet users .
and both of them are irritated that with all the investment in high-tech software and technology , it 's the simple things - a lack of descriptive words , for instance - that can render a website meaningless for the blind . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 . the party , in opposition since the september 2005 elections , backtracked from the market reform policies introduced under the last government , when it was the junior partner in social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition .
some 800 party delegates backed a motion for 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- a year in increased state expenditure in payments to the unemployed , on education and on child support .
at the same time , however , the party base voted by 59 percent to reject a plan to pay a basic income to everyone in germany , irrespective of whether they worked or not .
opponents of the more radical proposal said it would cost 1 trillion euros a year .
party leaders reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth were expected to resign if it had been passed .
strengthened in opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer believes the greens are now better prepared for the political arena bütikofer said the party had emerged from its congress halfway through germany 's electoral cycle " strengthened in opposition , strengthened in its capacity to govern . "
" if we wish our policy to have weight in society , it must be visionary and ambitious , but most of all politically practicable , " bütikofer told rank-and-file members .
the greens have been struggling to profile themselves as an opposition party , especially after the departure of their charismatic leader joschka fischer in 2005 .
the party 's repositioning on the german political scene is important because of the effect it may have on the coalition calculations in both the upcoming state elections next year and the 2009 general elections .
the rejection of the basic income proposal came as a relief to the greens ' leadership , which was seriously challenged at a special assembly two months ago when grassroots members - going back to their traditionally pacifist roots - voted down a leadership motion for continued support of the german military presence in afghanistan .
less surveillance , more freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charismatic joschka fischer was foreign minister under gerhard schröder greens delegates also rejected moves promoted by christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- interior minister wolfgang schäuble to increase police powers to monitor computers online , warning against a " preventive surveillance state " to counter the threat of terrorism .
in a shift to the left , the party staked out a position that combined environmental concerns with social policies .
it said it aimed to pay for the increased spending by increasing incomes taxes at the top end , raising inheritance taxes and closing tax loopholes .
germany faces important state elections next year .
at a federal level , chancellor angela merkel 's unwieldy grand coalition , combining her conservative christian cdu / csu bloc with the spd , is thought likely to survive until the september 2009 elections .
a recent poll gave the cdu / csu 40 per cent , the spd 24 , the left 12 , the greens 9 and the market-liberal fdp 9 percent of the national vote . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last updated : sunday , 25 november 2007 , 08:03 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version who is andrei lugovoi ?
andrei lugovoi has denied involvement in the murder former kgb agent andrei lugovoi is the prime suspect in the poisoning of russian exile alexander litvinenko in london last year .
mark franchetti of bbc two 's this world has gained unprecedented access to him .
andrei lugovoi is a man with a lot on his mind .
scotland yard suspects him of killing alexander litvinenko - the former kgb officer poisoned in london with polonium-210 last year - in what is the world 's first assassination known for sure to have been carried out with a radioactive substance .
as a result , he is also the man at the centre of the worst diplomatic crisis between britain and russia since the end of the cold war .
reason enough , one might think , to keep a low profile .
i was framed .
this was a conspiracy to slur russia and the kremlin .
i had no motive .
i am a rich man , i am a successful businessman , i have a family .
i would not do it for money or revenge andrei lugovoi but since the crown prosecution service announced five months ago that it wants russia to extradite lugovoi to put him on trial in britain , the 41-year-old russian businessman and former kgb bodyguard has done everything but keep out of the public eye , regularly giving interviews and press conferences .
so if you were under the impression that lugovoi is a man on the run , think again .
he may not be able to travel outside the former soviet union for fear of being arrested and extradited to a london court but at home , far from being a fugitive , britain 's most wanted is a celebrity .
political future next week lugovoi is also to stand for the russian parliament as a candidate for the ldpr , the ultra-nationalist party .
it may come as a surprise that a man accused of murder has a political future , but in russia many die-hard patriots are prepared to vote for him .
mark franchetti accompanied lugovoi on one of his camping trips it is partly to understand why , as well as try to shed some more light on how lugovoi became embroiled in the litvinenko case , that i spent so much time with him over the last few months .
obviously , i did not expect to crack the case but what interested me was who was lugovoi the man , and what does his story say about modern russia .
conspiracy theory citing russia 's constitution which bars citizens from being extradited to be put on trial abroad , the kremlin has flatly refused to hand over lugovoi .
scotland yard , meanwhile , is adamant that he poisoned alexander litvinenko by slipping a dose of polonium-210 in his tea during one of many meetings between the two men in london last year .
it also suspects that he acted on orders of russia 's fsb , the former kgb .
lugovoi , who was also contaminated with the deadly dangerous isotope , vehemently denies any involvement and claims to be a victim of a complex conspiracy involving british intelligence and opponents of vladimir putin , the russian president .
mark franchetti has been a moscow correspondent for 10 years " i was framed , " said lugovoi , who was once a kgb officer and is now a wealthy businessman .
" this was a conspiracy to slur russia and the kremlin .
i had no motive .
i am a rich man , i am a successful businessman , i have a family .

andrei lugovoi has denied involvement in the murder former kgb agent andrei lugovoi is the prime suspect in the poisoning of russian exile alexander litvinenko in london last year .
mark franchetti of bbc two 's this world has gained unprecedented access to him .
andrei lugovoi is a man with a lot on his mind .
scotland yard suspects him of killing alexander litvinenko - the former kgb officer poisoned in london with polonium-210 last year - in what is the world 's first assassination known for sure to have been carried out with a radioactive substance .
as a result , he is also the man at the centre of the worst diplomatic crisis between britain and russia since the end of the cold war .
reason enough , one might think , to keep a low profile .
i was framed .
this was a conspiracy to slur russia and the kremlin .
i had no motive .
i am a rich man , i am a successful businessman , i have a family .
i would not do it for money or revenge andrei lugovoi but since the crown prosecution service announced five months ago that it wants russia to extradite lugovoi to put him on trial in britain , the 41-year-old russian businessman and former kgb bodyguard has done everything but keep out of the public eye , regularly giving interviews and press conferences .
so if you were under the impression that lugovoi is a man on the run , think again .
he may not be able to travel outside the former soviet union for fear of being arrested and extradited to a london court but at home , far from being a fugitive , britain 's most wanted is a celebrity .
political future next week lugovoi is also to stand for the russian parliament as a candidate for the ldpr , the ultra-nationalist party .
it may come as a surprise that a man accused of murder has a political future , but in russia many die-hard patriots are prepared to vote for him .
mark franchetti accompanied lugovoi on one of his camping trips it is partly to understand why , as well as try to shed some more light on how lugovoi became embroiled in the litvinenko case , that i spent so much time with him over the last few months .
obviously , i did not expect to crack the case but what interested me was who was lugovoi the man , and what does his story say about modern russia .
conspiracy theory citing russia 's constitution which bars citizens from being extradited to be put on trial abroad , the kremlin has flatly refused to hand over lugovoi .
scotland yard , meanwhile , is adamant that he poisoned alexander litvinenko by slipping a dose of polonium-210 in his tea during one of many meetings between the two men in london last year .
it also suspects that he acted on orders of russia 's fsb , the former kgb .
lugovoi , who was also contaminated with the deadly dangerous isotope , vehemently denies any involvement and claims to be a victim of a complex conspiracy involving british intelligence and opponents of vladimir putin , the russian president .
mark franchetti has been a moscow correspondent for 10 years " i was framed , " said lugovoi , who was once a kgb officer and is now a wealthy businessman .
" this was a conspiracy to slur russia and the kremlin .

andrei lugovoi has denied involvement in the murder former kgb agent andrei lugovoi is the prime suspect in the poisoning of russian exile alexander litvinenko in london last year .
mark franchetti of bbc two 's this world has gained unprecedented access to him .
andrei lugovoi is a man with a lot on his mind .
scotland yard suspects him of killing alexander litvinenko - the former kgb officer poisoned in london with polonium-210 last year - in what is the world 's first assassination known for sure to have been carried out with a radioactive substance .
as a result , he is also the man at the centre of the worst diplomatic crisis between britain and russia since the end of the cold war .
reason enough , one might think , to keep a low profile .
i was framed .
this was a conspiracy to slur russia and the kremlin .
i had no motive .
i am a rich man , i am a successful businessman , i have a family .
i would not do it for money or revenge andrei lugovoi but since the crown prosecution service announced five months ago that it wants russia to extradite lugovoi to put him on trial in britain , the 41-year-old russian businessman and former kgb bodyguard has done everything but keep out of the public eye , regularly giving interviews and press conferences .
so if you were under the impression that lugovoi is a man on the run , think again .
he may not be able to travel outside the former soviet union for fear of being arrested and extradited to a london court but at home , far from being a fugitive , britain 's most wanted is a celebrity .
political future next week lugovoi is also to stand for the russian parliament as a candidate for the ldpr , the ultra-nationalist party .
it may come as a surprise that a man accused of murder has a political future , but in russia many die-hard patriots are prepared to vote for him .
mark franchetti accompanied lugovoi on one of his camping trips it is partly to understand why , as well as try to shed some more light on how lugovoi became embroiled in the litvinenko case , that i spent so much time with him over the last few months .
obviously , i did not expect to crack the case but what interested me was who was lugovoi the man , and what does his story say about modern russia .
conspiracy theory citing russia 's constitution which bars citizens from being extradited to be put on trial abroad , the kremlin has flatly refused to hand over lugovoi .
scotland yard , meanwhile , is adamant that he poisoned alexander litvinenko by slipping a dose of polonium-210 in his tea during one of many meetings between the two men in london last year .
it also suspects that he acted on orders of russia 's fsb , the former kgb .
lugovoi , who was also contaminated with the deadly dangerous isotope , vehemently denies any involvement and claims to be a victim of a complex conspiracy involving british intelligence and opponents of vladimir putin , the russian president .
mark franchetti has been a moscow correspondent for 10 years " i was framed , " said lugovoi , who was once a kgb officer and is now a wealthy businessman .
" this was a conspiracy to slur russia and the kremlin .
i had no motive .
i am a rich man , i am a successful businessman , i have a family .
i would not do it for money or revenge .
whichever way you look at it there is no motive .
" can one come to london and cold-bloodedly kill , and still behave calmly as i do - even though it has n't been at all easy for me for the last year ? " he adds .
used or tricked several people i interviewed , including a former kgb general , believe that if lugovoi did take part in litvinenko 's murder , he was used without knowing it .
according to this theory lugovoi was recruited by russia 's security services but deceived by them .
it is possible , experts in covert operations say , that he was tricked into believing that the substance used against litvinenko was a truth serum , or some debilitating drug .
" let 's , for the sake of argument , assume i had been in charge of such an operation , " speculated alexei kondaurov , who spent 22 years in the kgb .
lugovoi went to an elite military college and joined the kgb aged 20 " and let 's assume lugovoi was involved .
i would have told him as little as possible .
agents are used all the time without knowing the full details of an operation .
if he had something to do it , he did not know it would lead to death . "
it is a theory i put to lugovoi in our final interview .
self-assured as ever , he denied any involvement and claimed he was framed , not by russian special services , but by mi6 .
" mi6 wanted to kill him in order to discredit russia 's government , " said lugovoi , " because now in the west they all say that litvinenko was killed on kremlin and fsb orders . "
rising star in russia the truth is often elusive , and the real story about who was behind litvinenko 's murder is unlikely ever to come out .
but as lugovoi prepares to run for parliament , in russia those prepared to vote for him could not care whether or not he is guilty .
many think he is the innocent victim of a conspiracy to sully russia .
to those who think he did kill litvinenko he is guilty of nothing more than defending his motherland .
either way , he remains a free man and the kremlin will never hand him over .
for now at least , britain 's most wanted is a rising star .

mr campbell has now acknowledged to the programme that his former boss " does do god in quite a big way " , but that both men feared the public would be wary .

british voters imagined that leaders who were informed by religion would " commune with the man upstairs and then come back and say ' right , i 've been told the answer and that 's it " ' .
mr campbell 's refusal to discuss his faith was not due to any opposition to his beliefs , but because " you always get into trouble talking about it " , mr blair continued .
mr campbell added that the former prime minister always asked his aides to find him a church to attend , wherever he happened to be , each sunday .

" for me having faith was an important part of being able to do that , " he said .
if he sees a very attractive woman his eye will wander and all that stuff , he does n't look like your classic religious sort of guy alastair campbell but while it was commonplace in the us and elsewhere for politicians to talk about their religious convictions , he added , " you talk about it in our system and , frankly , people do think you 're a nutter " .
british voters imagined that leaders who were informed by religion would " commune with the man upstairs and then come back and say ' right , i 've been told the answer and that 's it " ' .
mr campbell 's refusal to discuss his faith was not due to any opposition to his beliefs , but because " you always get into trouble talking about it " , mr blair continued .
mr campbell added that the former prime minister always asked his aides to find him a church to attend , wherever he happened to be , each sunday .
" because he 's pretty irreverent , he swears a fair bit , if he sees a very attractive woman his eye will wander and all that stuff , he does n't look like your classic religious sort of guy , " said mr campbell .
but he added : " i think his close circle always understood that there was a part of him that was really , really important .
" on that kind of spiritual level it did inform a lot of what he talked about , what he read ... what he felt was important . "
mr campbell said the uk electorate were " a bit wary of politicians who go on about god " .
he had also been concerned that the conservatives would accuse labour of trying to claim faith as its own .
' ethical values ' peter mandelson , a close confidant of mr blair , said : " he 's not an exhibitionist when it comes to religion but deep inside him it is very , very important .
" this is a man who takes a bible with him wherever he goes and last thing at night he will read from the bible . "
sir menzies campbell , the former liberal democrat leader , suggested that mr blair may not have been so politically successful had the relationship between his beliefs and his actions in office been better known .
" the public might have been less willing to give him the triumph of three consecutive general election victories if they 'd known the extent to which ethical values would overshadow pragmatism , " sir menzies said .
the blair years will be screened on bbc one at 2215 gmt on 25 november .
the episode in which mr blair discusses his faith will be broadcast on sunday 2 december .
