illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .

she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .
in addition , there are about one million divorces in the eu each year , and 20 percent of them involve people from two different european nations .
so , there 's a dire need to have clearer legislation as to how to deal with such transnational cases in the bloc . " the dresden meeting of eu interior and justice ministers is an informal one , so no immediate policy changes are expected .

hoping to increase awareness for development issues , germany plans to introduce a new volunteer service for young people in 2008 .
most experts welcomed the idea in principle , but expressed concerns about logistics . when german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul recently announced her plan for a new voluntary service abroad program , she said she was simply reacting to an unmet demand . " every day , we are hearing from young people who want to do something , " the social democrat told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
" we want to respond to this desire to do something . " wieczorek-zeul 's response is aimed at people between the ages of 18 and 28 , who have a high school diploma or equivalent certificate and want to work in a developing country for three to 24 months . the ministry offers to pay 580 euros -lrb- $ 752 -rrb- per month to cover living costs .
in total , wieczorek-zeul plans to earmark 70 million euros for 10,000 participants .
the money will not come from existing programs , but new funds , according to a ministry spokesman . providing the means to volunteer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " we want teenagers , whose families do not have the means , to be able to volunteer abroad , " she told the paper , adding that existing volunteer programs often come with a hefty price tag . those working in the field generally welcomed the idea . " we think it 's a positive thing that the ministry is getting involved , " said jan gildemeister , the executive director of action committee service for peace -lrb- acsp -rrb- , an umbrella organization for christian groups that offer voluntary service programs abroad .

" wieczorek-zeul 's response is aimed at people between the ages of 18 and 28 , who have a high school diploma or equivalent certificate and want to work in a developing country for three to 24 months . the ministry offers to pay 580 euros -lrb- $ 752 -rrb- per month to cover living costs .
in total , wieczorek-zeul plans to earmark 70 million euros for 10,000 participants .

" in the context of school supervision , the lawmaker can decide on rules regarding the extent to which teachers are banned from wearing external symbols and pieces of clothing that express a religious or ideological conviction while teaching , " said judge karl huber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike in france , german students are allowed to wear headscarves an islamic religious group , which brought the case to the court , claimed that the bavarian headscarf ban - which was adopted in november 2004 - was unconstitutional because it did not treat all religions as equal , outlawing only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols . the state government , on the other hand , argued that the hijab - a headscarf which is meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family - was clashing with gender equality , which is guaranteed by the constitution . this latest legal wrangle over headscarves highlights the inconsistency of bavaria 's state 's school law .
it says that no-one is allowed to wear religious symbols in the classroom - except christians and jews . all or none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is , among other things , about reconciling islam with western values the heated debate was first sparked in 2003 when germany 's federal constitutional court ruled that muslims could wear their headscarves while teaching but at the same time encouraged new laws to ban religious symbols .
eight german states , including berlin , have so far passed school laws that ban headscarves . unlike other headscarf-banning states , which saw the muslim attire as an affront to christian values , berlin decided to treat all religious symbols on an equal basis . " berlin is the only city and german state which has not only banned the headscarf , but all religious symbols in schools - that is the big difference , " said günther piening , who is the berlin commissioner for integration and migration . " i think that 's the only way to do it , because the general ban does not discriminate against one religion , " he added .
" it abides by the principle of equality as laid down in the german constitution . " women 's rights groups and conservative politicians , however , argue that many moslem women have no choice but to wear a headscarf because their families demand it .
yet , according to a recent survey conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , 97 percent of those women asked said it was the duty of a muslim woman to cover her head and that they should be allowed to wear them wherever and whenever they choose - an opinion not shared by the vast majority of germans . not a political statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz sees the headscarf as a sign of separation and unwillingness to integrate according to the deputy secretary general of the konrad adenauer foundation , christoph kannengiesser , the wearing of a headscarf is not necessarily a political statement and it should not stop the communication between muslims and germans . " we must not allow muslim women to separate themselves from german society , " kannengiesser said .
" we have to work harder to integrate them and the women also have to be willing to integrate .
muslims , however , are part of german society and we have to accept it if muslim girls and women choose to wear the headscarf . " the headscarf debate remains a political hot potato .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has repeatedly called on moslems to accept different opinions on the role of women and the wearing of headscarves . a few months ago , ekin deligöz , an ethnic turk and member of the green party in the german parliament , was placed under police protection after receiving death threats because she called on moslem women to take off their headscarves .
the affair triggered an outcry among the german population with many people wondering just how prepared muslims really are to integrate and also accept criticism . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hip-hop with a headscarf sahira is currently one of berlin 's most successful hip-hop artists .

" i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview on german radio on sunday . the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of germany 's nuclear power plants would be shut down by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says she wants realistic but environmentally safe alternatives to nuclear energy merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- signed on the nuclear phase-out plan when they formed a grand coalition government with spd after the 2005 elections - said , however , that german nuclear power plants could not be replaced by coal-powered plants because of carbon dioxide emissions and concerns about their contributing to global warming . according to merkel , climate change is one of the greatest challenges that humanity is facing today . sticking to the plan even though members of merkel 's own party have repeatedly asked for the government to reconsider the nuclear phase-out - especially in view of germany 's reliance on russian gas supplies - merkel said she was not planning on backing out of the coalition agreement , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions " at least for this legislative period , there will be no changes , " merkel said , referring to the phase-out .
" but we need to be realistic and look into how much can be achieved in how long . " six billion tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- a year pour into the atmosphere worldwide from sources such as power stations , chemical plants and steel foundries .
co2 contributes to global warming by trapping the sun ’ s rays in the atmosphere . merkel 's coalition partners from the spd remain strongly opposed to any changes to the phase-out plan . " the nuclear phase-out is possible along with a tightening of climate protection , " said ulrich kelber , deputy president of the spd parliamentary bloc . germany itself is divided over nuclear issues .
according to a forsa poll published on sunday , one half of germans are either in favor of prolonging the life of the country 's nuclear power plants or abandoning the nuclear phase-out altogether .
the other half would like to stick to the plan to shut the nuclear plants down . last week , the eu unveiled sweeping plans to diversify energy sources , limit greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and increase the use of renewable energy sources . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's criticism of russia over energy marks shift in ties chancellor angela merkel 's rebuke of russia over it halting oil supplies to europe has revealed a possible shift in ties between the two countries .

dw 's ute schaeffer says germany and europe urgently need to rethink their policy towards africa . ghana - the country that german president horst köhler just visited for four days - is for african standards a model state .
the country 's progress , however , is still governed by foreign factors , both old and new .
traditionally , african development has been influenced by donor nations in europe and the usa .
more recently , the emerging economies of india and china have become factors of influence as well .
chinese investments in ghana , for instance , have long exceeded those of great britain .
china is pushing its way into the west african state with all its might . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer globalization and rapid growth of the emerging economies have outrun the classical , european type of development policy .
africa is now part of a new international architecture . ghanaians living abroad transfer up to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to their homeland every year , making a significant contribution to its economic growth .
in ghana , like in other parts of africa , doors remain wide open for china and india . europe has so far missed on this development and that 's what the german president is concerned about .
the old development recipes are no longer effective .
europe 's outdated africa policy , in which everybody takes care of their own , personal africa , should be dead and buried .
how long does europe think it can keep its markets protected from african products ?
how long can europe keep believing that it can prevent migration from the neighboring continent using high walls , border controls or reception camps in the north african desert ? the european policy toward africa , which is shaped by fear and protectionism , is limiting africa 's potential that others have long noticed and taken advantage of .
europe should become more aware of its own interests in africa , including , for example , the issue of energy .
at the moment , africa produces 12 percent of the world 's crude oil supplies .
by 2010 , that amount will double .
the continent has over 50 million tons of natural gas at its disposal , which is one third of the deposits in the world . africa 's unused potentials include its manpower .
europe needs immigrants as well temporary foreign workers .
migrations - from africa and elsewhere - must be legalized and africans , too , must be allowed temporary entry to europe .
not the least because africa is a growing market that countries like china and india have long noticed and started exploiting .
africa is developing quickly .
ghana is a case in point . europe should not hand its neighbor continent over to china .
it is important to establish wide-ranging connections , social contacts and networks to get to know each other so that everybody can recognize their common interest .
the german president knows this , which is why he has launched his africa initiative .
with his continuing engagement and his third trip to africa , he wants to make sure that africa remains on the german government 's agenda . germany could set certain things in motion for africa , both in the eu and at the g8 summit .
this could happen in theory at least , since other topics - the constitutional process or relations to central asia - are seen as the more urgent priorities of the german eu presidency .
the german government , however , is planning to address the issues of african economic conditions and development at the g8 level .
is that the first sign that the old europe is waking up and beginning to see its own chances in africa ?

the concept , dubbed sightsleeping -lrb- sightseeing plus sleeping -rrb- , runs parallel to the national german center for tourism focus on art and culture in 2007 . jury selected first hotels a seven-member jury of art , design and tourism experts selected the first 12 official sightsleeping hotels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nebelhorn relaxhotel is one of the hotels with a more contemporary atmosphere only castles , manors , other land-marked buildings and houses with contemporary furnishings were taken into consideration .
to be considered a sightsleeping hotel , they had to offer visually appealing decor , which could include paintings , prints , drawings or sculptures . in addition , the guest houses should offer extra events , like author readings , concerts or theatrical performances . from renaissance to avant-garde at schloss eggersberg in altmühltal , for example , guests can order a brass ensemble to play folk music , or even organize their own piano recital on a blüthner grand piano from 1894 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lobby in munich 's hotel advokat for something slightly more modern , visitors to the 1960s retro-chic hotel advokat in downtown munich can relax , work , sleep or dine among avant-garde works of art .

illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .
he 's hoping to convince his counterparts that a central eu data base on crime is urgently needed . fighting crime and reforming laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries is in the mood for reforms meanwhile , german justice minister brigitte zypries , for her part , wants to promote tougher legislation against racially motivated crimes , including the denial of the holocaust .
a german proposal seeks to criminalize all racist declarations that incite violence against a single person or specific group of people . but the german justice minister also called for harmonization of a wide range of other legal issues .
she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .
in addition , there are about one million divorces in the eu each year , and 20 percent of them involve people from two different european nations .
so , there 's a dire need to have clearer legislation as to how to deal with such transnational cases in the bloc . " the dresden meeting of eu interior and justice ministers is an informal one , so no immediate policy changes are expected .

illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .
he 's hoping to convince his counterparts that a central eu data base on crime is urgently needed . fighting crime and reforming laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries is in the mood for reforms meanwhile , german justice minister brigitte zypries , for her part , wants to promote tougher legislation against racially motivated crimes , including the denial of the holocaust .
a german proposal seeks to criminalize all racist declarations that incite violence against a single person or specific group of people . but the german justice minister also called for harmonization of a wide range of other legal issues .
she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .
in addition , there are about one million divorces in the eu each year , and 20 percent of them involve people from two different european nations .
so , there 's a dire need to have clearer legislation as to how to deal with such transnational cases in the bloc . " the dresden meeting of eu interior and justice ministers is an informal one , so no immediate policy changes are expected .
it is hoped though that many of the proposals made in dresden will be turned into law later this year . hardy graupner / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , african officials discuss immigration ministers from more than 50 eu and african countries are expected to conclude a conference in the libyan capital tripoli on migration flows and development with a joint declaration on migration issues .

" in the context of school supervision , the lawmaker can decide on rules regarding the extent to which teachers are banned from wearing external symbols and pieces of clothing that express a religious or ideological conviction while teaching , " said judge karl huber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike in france , german students are allowed to wear headscarves an islamic religious group , which brought the case to the court , claimed that the bavarian headscarf ban - which was adopted in november 2004 - was unconstitutional because it did not treat all religions as equal , outlawing only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols . the state government , on the other hand , argued that the hijab - a headscarf which is meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family - was clashing with gender equality , which is guaranteed by the constitution . this latest legal wrangle over headscarves highlights the inconsistency of bavaria 's state 's school law .
it says that no-one is allowed to wear religious symbols in the classroom - except christians and jews . all or none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is , among other things , about reconciling islam with western values the heated debate was first sparked in 2003 when germany 's federal constitutional court ruled that muslims could wear their headscarves while teaching but at the same time encouraged new laws to ban religious symbols .
eight german states , including berlin , have so far passed school laws that ban headscarves . unlike other headscarf-banning states , which saw the muslim attire as an affront to christian values , berlin decided to treat all religious symbols on an equal basis . " berlin is the only city and german state which has not only banned the headscarf , but all religious symbols in schools - that is the big difference , " said günther piening , who is the berlin commissioner for integration and migration . " i think that 's the only way to do it , because the general ban does not discriminate against one religion , " he added .
" it abides by the principle of equality as laid down in the german constitution . " women 's rights groups and conservative politicians , however , argue that many moslem women have no choice but to wear a headscarf because their families demand it .
yet , according to a recent survey conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , 97 percent of those women asked said it was the duty of a muslim woman to cover her head and that they should be allowed to wear them wherever and whenever they choose - an opinion not shared by the vast majority of germans . not a political statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz sees the headscarf as a sign of separation and unwillingness to integrate according to the deputy secretary general of the konrad adenauer foundation , christoph kannengiesser , the wearing of a headscarf is not necessarily a political statement and it should not stop the communication between muslims and germans . " we must not allow muslim women to separate themselves from german society , " kannengiesser said .
" we have to work harder to integrate them and the women also have to be willing to integrate .
muslims , however , are part of german society and we have to accept it if muslim girls and women choose to wear the headscarf . " the headscarf debate remains a political hot potato .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has repeatedly called on moslems to accept different opinions on the role of women and the wearing of headscarves . a few months ago , ekin deligöz , an ethnic turk and member of the green party in the german parliament , was placed under police protection after receiving death threats because she called on moslem women to take off their headscarves .

yet , according to a recent survey conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , 97 percent of those women asked said it was the duty of a muslim woman to cover her head and that they should be allowed to wear them wherever and whenever they choose - an opinion not shared by the vast majority of germans . not a political statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz sees the headscarf as a sign of separation and unwillingness to integrate according to the deputy secretary general of the konrad adenauer foundation , christoph kannengiesser , the wearing of a headscarf is not necessarily a political statement and it should not stop the communication between muslims and germans .

muslims , however , are part of german society and we have to accept it if muslim girls and women choose to wear the headscarf . " the headscarf debate remains a political hot potato .

india 's automobile sector is currently growing at an estimated 17 percent a year . add that to an annual growth rate of almost 10 percent and it 's not difficult to see why the german car industry - which has thus far focused largely on china - is increasingly training its sights on india . daimlerchrysler , vw lead the way earlier this month , daimlerchrysler ag , the world 's second-largest luxury carmaker , said it was investing 44 million euros -lrb- $ 57 million -rrb- to build a new assembly plant in the western indian state of maharashtra .
the state is already home to factories of tata , renault and fiat spa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercedes s-class symbolizes top quality in india by 2009 , the stuttgart-based german-american carmaker - which currently assembles the e-class , c-class and s-class models in india - plans to roll out a further 5,000 luxury models a year . wolfsburg-based volkswagen last year signed a whopping deal worth 410 million euros - the single-biggest foreign investment in indian so far - with the government of maharashtra to set up a production facility on the outskirts of the rapidly growing city of pune .
the plant will manufacture the passat and other models . volkswagen 's affiliate audi ag will also begin work on producing the a6 sedan in india this year . mercedes as a status symbol " the indian car market has huge growth potential , " said thomas becker , deputy head of the german car industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- .
he pointed out that german carmakers in india saw growth rates of over 33 percent in 2006 , double the rate of the indian market as a whole . though german carmakers only have a market share of around one percent in india , becker stressed that it was changing fast given that they had a solid presence in the luxury car segment .
" it 's really important that you 're up there in the high-value segment nice and early , " he added . dilip chenoy , head of the society of indian automobile manufacturers -lrb- siam -rrb- said german carmakers are prized for their luxury cars and diesel technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign cars are a status symbol for india 's well-heeled " german cars are valued for their quality and sturdiness , " chenoy said , adding that most of them boasted sophisticated technology , a smooth drive and sleek looks and contrasted greatly with the traditional image of lumbering diesel-powered cars . chenoy added that german luxury cars had also become something of a status symbol among india 's upwardly mobile and wealthy classes . daimlerchrysler - with more than 80 percent of the market share - is the unmistakable leader in the luxury segment . " the cars are a ' statement ' and they 're the vehicle of choice for many managers , " chenoy said .
" the main buyers are big companies , " said chenoy , adding that the mercedes is usually bought by an increasingly affluent new class of entrepreneurs in northern india . problems remain despite india 's robustly growing economy and surging consumer confidence , the country 's road network , hampered by potholes and heavy congestion , still needs to be expanded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's terrible roads remain a huge barrier to foreign investment german carmakers say that strengthens the case for setting up their own production plants in india , also arguing that in light of high indian import tariffs , it makes sense to ship auto parts from germany and assemble the cars in india . " this process is usually preferred as a first step towards setting up your own production in many emerging markets , " becker said , adding that the operation in no way undermined the performance of the car or damaged germany 's high reputation for quality products . german carmakers say that one way to lower high import tariffs and dismantle other barriers to investment in india would be to set up a free-trade zone between the eu and india next year .
that would also make it easier for india to export cars and auto components to europe . ana lehmann -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automobile market ends 2006 with a bang the german car industry zoomed to record levels of exports and production last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 15.01.2007 european press review : the quintessential macho großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sakozy wants to be a " president of the people " dw-world.de takes a look at comments in european papers about the nomination of french interior minister nicolas sarkozy as conservative candidate in the april presidential elections . sarkozy launched his campaign for the presidency at a triumphant party congress in paris sunday , issuing an appeal to voters of all persuasions to make him a " president of the people " at april 's election . in a speech before some 80,000 members of the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- , sarkozy set out the broad lines of his manifesto , promising to " reassert the value of work , " restore " authority and respect " and establish a society of " obligations as well as rights . " he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .
" sarkozy , the quintessential macho , is usually quick and without scruples bordering brutality when he 's trying to hit an opponent .
his ability to punch has worked well in a political world dominated by men .
it wo n't be of much use against madame royal . " der tagesspiegel in berlin opined that it was time for president jacques chirac to rally behind his party colleague : " sarkozy 's nomination is a last defeat for chirac , who has done everything to prevent this .
but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .
both have remained political outsiders , who will have to fight against the establishment . "
" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .
ms royal also offers france and europe a break from the political past .
but her socially inclusive and pragmatic approach offers her country and our continent a much more constructive and trustworthy way forward than mr sarkozy 's . "
the times of london saw things differently .
" it is now official : in their next presidential election , french voters will face a choice between mr sarkozy 's pugnacious style and - he promises - uncompromising reforms , and the sweeping , sentimental generalities of segolene royal , the first woman to run for the elysee palace .
it is , in essence , a choice between a long-delayed and sorely-needed dose of gallic thatcherism , and a romantic reaffirmation of the socialist consensus that has cosseted the french public sector for so long that even france 's long-suffering taxpayers can no longer afford it .
both options are revolutionary , but the latter is revolutionary only because ms royal is a woman .
indeed , she has said that a win for her campaign would be a ' revolutionary gesture , ' and 40 per cent of voters have apparently opined in polls that her principal strength is her gender ... mr sarkozy , meanwhile , is walking a political tightrope .
he will need the votes of many on the right who backed jean marie le pen and the national front in 2002 , and he has already signalled that he favours a robust immigration policy .
but he can not afford to lose the entire immigrant vote in the process , and has floated positive discrimination schemes in a bid to broaden his appeal .
they would have helped his immigrant father , and if they help him to become president , that would help france . "
and in paris , liberation commented : " yes , this man is dangerous , especially for the left .
he is not the caesar nor the napolean that one sometimes sees in him .
elected in a referendum by a large majority of his camp , interior minister sarkozy is his own master and steers the ship of modern conservatism .
energy , talent and organization have helped him to this triumph .
he 's got a tight grip on things and that 's worrying .
the danger is now well-known .
a champ , who rules the media as much as himself , the state , his speech and a horrifying machinery .

" he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .
" sarkozy , the quintessential macho , is usually quick and without scruples bordering brutality when he 's trying to hit an opponent .
his ability to punch has worked well in a political world dominated by men .
it wo n't be of much use against madame royal . " der tagesspiegel in berlin opined that it was time for president jacques chirac to rally behind his party colleague : " sarkozy 's nomination is a last defeat for chirac , who has done everything to prevent this .
but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .
both have remained political outsiders , who will have to fight against the establishment . "
" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .
ms royal also offers france and europe a break from the political past .
but her socially inclusive and pragmatic approach offers her country and our continent a much more constructive and trustworthy way forward than mr sarkozy 's . "
the times of london saw things differently .
" it is now official : in their next presidential election , french voters will face a choice between mr sarkozy 's pugnacious style and - he promises - uncompromising reforms , and the sweeping , sentimental generalities of segolene royal , the first woman to run for the elysee palace .
it is , in essence , a choice between a long-delayed and sorely-needed dose of gallic thatcherism , and a romantic reaffirmation of the socialist consensus that has cosseted the french public sector for so long that even france 's long-suffering taxpayers can no longer afford it .
both options are revolutionary , but the latter is revolutionary only because ms royal is a woman .
indeed , she has said that a win for her campaign would be a ' revolutionary gesture , ' and 40 per cent of voters have apparently opined in polls that her principal strength is her gender ... mr sarkozy , meanwhile , is walking a political tightrope .
he will need the votes of many on the right who backed jean marie le pen and the national front in 2002 , and he has already signalled that he favours a robust immigration policy .
but he can not afford to lose the entire immigrant vote in the process , and has floated positive discrimination schemes in a bid to broaden his appeal .

" he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .
" sarkozy , the quintessential macho , is usually quick and without scruples bordering brutality when he 's trying to hit an opponent .
his ability to punch has worked well in a political world dominated by men .
it wo n't be of much use against madame royal . " der tagesspiegel in berlin opined that it was time for president jacques chirac to rally behind his party colleague : " sarkozy 's nomination is a last defeat for chirac , who has done everything to prevent this .
but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .
both have remained political outsiders , who will have to fight against the establishment . "
" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .
ms royal also offers france and europe a break from the political past .
but her socially inclusive and pragmatic approach offers her country and our continent a much more constructive and trustworthy way forward than mr sarkozy 's . "
the times of london saw things differently .
" it is now official : in their next presidential election , french voters will face a choice between mr sarkozy 's pugnacious style and - he promises - uncompromising reforms , and the sweeping , sentimental generalities of segolene royal , the first woman to run for the elysee palace .
it is , in essence , a choice between a long-delayed and sorely-needed dose of gallic thatcherism , and a romantic reaffirmation of the socialist consensus that has cosseted the french public sector for so long that even france 's long-suffering taxpayers can no longer afford it .
both options are revolutionary , but the latter is revolutionary only because ms royal is a woman .
indeed , she has said that a win for her campaign would be a ' revolutionary gesture , ' and 40 per cent of voters have apparently opined in polls that her principal strength is her gender ... mr sarkozy , meanwhile , is walking a political tightrope .
he will need the votes of many on the right who backed jean marie le pen and the national front in 2002 , and he has already signalled that he favours a robust immigration policy .
but he can not afford to lose the entire immigrant vote in the process , and has floated positive discrimination schemes in a bid to broaden his appeal .
they would have helped his immigrant father , and if they help him to become president , that would help france . "
and in paris , liberation commented : " yes , this man is dangerous , especially for the left .
he is not the caesar nor the napolean that one sometimes sees in him .
elected in a referendum by a large majority of his camp , interior minister sarkozy is his own master and steers the ship of modern conservatism .

india 's automobile sector is currently growing at an estimated 17 percent a year . add that to an annual growth rate of almost 10 percent and it 's not difficult to see why the german car industry - which has thus far focused largely on china - is increasingly training its sights on india . daimlerchrysler , vw lead the way earlier this month , daimlerchrysler ag , the world 's second-largest luxury carmaker , said it was investing 44 million euros -lrb- $ 57 million -rrb- to build a new assembly plant in the western indian state of maharashtra .

india 's automobile sector is currently growing at an estimated 17 percent a year . add that to an annual growth rate of almost 10 percent and it 's not difficult to see why the german car industry - which has thus far focused largely on china - is increasingly training its sights on india . daimlerchrysler , vw lead the way earlier this month , daimlerchrysler ag , the world 's second-largest luxury carmaker , said it was investing 44 million euros -lrb- $ 57 million -rrb- to build a new assembly plant in the western indian state of maharashtra .
the state is already home to factories of tata , renault and fiat spa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercedes s-class symbolizes top quality in india by 2009 , the stuttgart-based german-american carmaker - which currently assembles the e-class , c-class and s-class models in india - plans to roll out a further 5,000 luxury models a year . wolfsburg-based volkswagen last year signed a whopping deal worth 410 million euros - the single-biggest foreign investment in indian so far - with the government of maharashtra to set up a production facility on the outskirts of the rapidly growing city of pune .
the plant will manufacture the passat and other models . volkswagen 's affiliate audi ag will also begin work on producing the a6 sedan in india this year . mercedes as a status symbol " the indian car market has huge growth potential , " said thomas becker , deputy head of the german car industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- .
he pointed out that german carmakers in india saw growth rates of over 33 percent in 2006 , double the rate of the indian market as a whole . though german carmakers only have a market share of around one percent in india , becker stressed that it was changing fast given that they had a solid presence in the luxury car segment .
" it 's really important that you 're up there in the high-value segment nice and early , " he added . dilip chenoy , head of the society of indian automobile manufacturers -lrb- siam -rrb- said german carmakers are prized for their luxury cars and diesel technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign cars are a status symbol for india 's well-heeled " german cars are valued for their quality and sturdiness , " chenoy said , adding that most of them boasted sophisticated technology , a smooth drive and sleek looks and contrasted greatly with the traditional image of lumbering diesel-powered cars . chenoy added that german luxury cars had also become something of a status symbol among india 's upwardly mobile and wealthy classes . daimlerchrysler - with more than 80 percent of the market share - is the unmistakable leader in the luxury segment . " the cars are a ' statement ' and they 're the vehicle of choice for many managers , " chenoy said .
" the main buyers are big companies , " said chenoy , adding that the mercedes is usually bought by an increasingly affluent new class of entrepreneurs in northern india . problems remain despite india 's robustly growing economy and surging consumer confidence , the country 's road network , hampered by potholes and heavy congestion , still needs to be expanded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's terrible roads remain a huge barrier to foreign investment german carmakers say that strengthens the case for setting up their own production plants in india , also arguing that in light of high indian import tariffs , it makes sense to ship auto parts from germany and assemble the cars in india . " this process is usually preferred as a first step towards setting up your own production in many emerging markets , " becker said , adding that the operation in no way undermined the performance of the car or damaged germany 's high reputation for quality products . german carmakers say that one way to lower high import tariffs and dismantle other barriers to investment in india would be to set up a free-trade zone between the eu and india next year .
that would also make it easier for india to export cars and auto components to europe . ana lehmann -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automobile market ends 2006 with a bang the german car industry zoomed to record levels of exports and production last year .
the country also saw a surge of new passenger car registrations - mainly a result of buyers rushing to beat a tax hike .

ferrero-waldner spoke to dw-radio about the upcoming visit and the state of relations between the eu and china . dw : how would you sum up the current state of relations between the eu and china ? ferrero-waldner : i would say that relations are very comprehensive and very important but we also see that in our trade cooperation agreement that we have from 1985 , these strategic partnerships that we have today with china , this old agreement is no longer up to the job .
this is the reason why during this trip my main purpose is to launch negotiations for the new partnership and cooperation agreement that will be much more comprehensive and which will build on this changing relationship that we have . in real terms , what do you hope to achieve ? in real terms , i think it will be necessary to really agree on providing a comprehensive framework for the 22 sectors in which the eu and china are already holding dialogues , including energy , the environment , agriculture , transport , education , science and technology but also key issues such as sustainable development , migration and of course the international challenges we both face such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction . on the topic of energy , china is a major global polluter .
is there an implicit message from the eu which is " you must change what you are doing " ? we already have a partnership on climate change with china since september 2005 as well as various action plans and memorandums of understanding where we touch upon clean coal , energy efficiency and renewable energies in general .
but we think china is so big that whatever we do in reducing emissions could be offset by china .
therefore we think it is highly important that china take on our technologies .
for instance , clean coal technology with carbon capture because china is currently bringing one coal fired power plant online every week .
you can imagine what that means .
therefore we want to get china closely working together with us and we 're taking the lead here . what 's in this for china ? i think china itself realizes more and more , and is interested in having a development in their industry that in the end does not jeopardize the environment .

ferrero-waldner spoke to dw-radio about the upcoming visit and the state of relations between the eu and china . dw : how would you sum up the current state of relations between the eu and china ? ferrero-waldner : i would say that relations are very comprehensive and very important but we also see that in our trade cooperation agreement that we have from 1985 , these strategic partnerships that we have today with china , this old agreement is no longer up to the job .
this is the reason why during this trip my main purpose is to launch negotiations for the new partnership and cooperation agreement that will be much more comprehensive and which will build on this changing relationship that we have . in real terms , what do you hope to achieve ? in real terms , i think it will be necessary to really agree on providing a comprehensive framework for the 22 sectors in which the eu and china are already holding dialogues , including energy , the environment , agriculture , transport , education , science and technology but also key issues such as sustainable development , migration and of course the international challenges we both face such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction . on the topic of energy , china is a major global polluter .
is there an implicit message from the eu which is " you must change what you are doing " ? we already have a partnership on climate change with china since september 2005 as well as various action plans and memorandums of understanding where we touch upon clean coal , energy efficiency and renewable energies in general .
but we think china is so big that whatever we do in reducing emissions could be offset by china .
therefore we think it is highly important that china take on our technologies .
for instance , clean coal technology with carbon capture because china is currently bringing one coal fired power plant online every week .
you can imagine what that means .
therefore we want to get china closely working together with us and we 're taking the lead here . what 's in this for china ? i think china itself realizes more and more , and is interested in having a development in their industry that in the end does not jeopardize the environment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : development aid to africa tops g8 agenda " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid experts question g8 's emphasis on africa europe rushes to stem flood of cocaine coming through africa opinion -pipe- 15.01.2007 opinion : germany 's africa policy must pay heed to globalization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of his trip to ghana , german president horst köhler called for a real partnership between africa and europe .
dw 's ute schaeffer says germany and europe urgently need to rethink their policy towards africa . ghana - the country that german president horst köhler just visited for four days - is for african standards a model state .
the country 's progress , however , is still governed by foreign factors , both old and new .
traditionally , african development has been influenced by donor nations in europe and the usa .
more recently , the emerging economies of india and china have become factors of influence as well .
chinese investments in ghana , for instance , have long exceeded those of great britain .
china is pushing its way into the west african state with all its might . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer globalization and rapid growth of the emerging economies have outrun the classical , european type of development policy .
africa is now part of a new international architecture . ghanaians living abroad transfer up to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to their homeland every year , making a significant contribution to its economic growth .
in ghana , like in other parts of africa , doors remain wide open for china and india . europe has so far missed on this development and that 's what the german president is concerned about .
the old development recipes are no longer effective .
europe 's outdated africa policy , in which everybody takes care of their own , personal africa , should be dead and buried .
how long does europe think it can keep its markets protected from african products ?
how long can europe keep believing that it can prevent migration from the neighboring continent using high walls , border controls or reception camps in the north african desert ? the european policy toward africa , which is shaped by fear and protectionism , is limiting africa 's potential that others have long noticed and taken advantage of .
europe should become more aware of its own interests in africa , including , for example , the issue of energy .
at the moment , africa produces 12 percent of the world 's crude oil supplies .
by 2010 , that amount will double .
the continent has over 50 million tons of natural gas at its disposal , which is one third of the deposits in the world . africa 's unused potentials include its manpower .
europe needs immigrants as well temporary foreign workers .
migrations - from africa and elsewhere - must be legalized and africans , too , must be allowed temporary entry to europe .
not the least because africa is a growing market that countries like china and india have long noticed and started exploiting .
africa is developing quickly .
ghana is a case in point . europe should not hand its neighbor continent over to china .
it is important to establish wide-ranging connections , social contacts and networks to get to know each other so that everybody can recognize their common interest .
the german president knows this , which is why he has launched his africa initiative .
with his continuing engagement and his third trip to africa , he wants to make sure that africa remains on the german government 's agenda . germany could set certain things in motion for africa , both in the eu and at the g8 summit .
this could happen in theory at least , since other topics - the constitutional process or relations to central asia - are seen as the more urgent priorities of the german eu presidency .
the german government , however , is planning to address the issues of african economic conditions and development at the g8 level .
is that the first sign that the old europe is waking up and beginning to see its own chances in africa ?
perhaps , though not definitely . ute schaeffer is head of dw-radio 's africa program -lrb- tt -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de illegal migration high on new eu presidency 's agenda with germany now president of the european union , the city of dresden hosts the first informal meeting of eu interior and justice ministers of the new presidency monday .

hoping to increase awareness for development issues , germany plans to introduce a new volunteer service for young people in 2008 .
most experts welcomed the idea in principle , but expressed concerns about logistics . when german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul recently announced her plan for a new voluntary service abroad program , she said she was simply reacting to an unmet demand . " every day , we are hearing from young people who want to do something , " the social democrat told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
" we want to respond to this desire to do something . " wieczorek-zeul 's response is aimed at people between the ages of 18 and 28 , who have a high school diploma or equivalent certificate and want to work in a developing country for three to 24 months . the ministry offers to pay 580 euros -lrb- $ 752 -rrb- per month to cover living costs .
in total , wieczorek-zeul plans to earmark 70 million euros for 10,000 participants .
the money will not come from existing programs , but new funds , according to a ministry spokesman . providing the means to volunteer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " we want teenagers , whose families do not have the means , to be able to volunteer abroad , " she told the paper , adding that existing volunteer programs often come with a hefty price tag . those working in the field generally welcomed the idea .

" if there 's a need for people , it 's for experts in selected areas , not someone who 'll help out at the hospital or can fill in excel spreadsheets .

dw 's ute schaeffer says germany and europe urgently need to rethink their policy towards africa . ghana - the country that german president horst köhler just visited for four days - is for african standards a model state .
the country 's progress , however , is still governed by foreign factors , both old and new .
traditionally , african development has been influenced by donor nations in europe and the usa .
more recently , the emerging economies of india and china have become factors of influence as well .
chinese investments in ghana , for instance , have long exceeded those of great britain .
china is pushing its way into the west african state with all its might . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer globalization and rapid growth of the emerging economies have outrun the classical , european type of development policy .
africa is now part of a new international architecture . ghanaians living abroad transfer up to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to their homeland every year , making a significant contribution to its economic growth .
in ghana , like in other parts of africa , doors remain wide open for china and india . europe has so far missed on this development and that 's what the german president is concerned about .
the old development recipes are no longer effective .
europe 's outdated africa policy , in which everybody takes care of their own , personal africa , should be dead and buried .

hoping to increase awareness for development issues , germany plans to introduce a new volunteer service for young people in 2008 .
most experts welcomed the idea in principle , but expressed concerns about logistics . when german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul recently announced her plan for a new voluntary service abroad program , she said she was simply reacting to an unmet demand . " every day , we are hearing from young people who want to do something , " the social democrat told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
" we want to respond to this desire to do something . " wieczorek-zeul 's response is aimed at people between the ages of 18 and 28 , who have a high school diploma or equivalent certificate and want to work in a developing country for three to 24 months . the ministry offers to pay 580 euros -lrb- $ 752 -rrb- per month to cover living costs .
in total , wieczorek-zeul plans to earmark 70 million euros for 10,000 participants .
the money will not come from existing programs , but new funds , according to a ministry spokesman . providing the means to volunteer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " we want teenagers , whose families do not have the means , to be able to volunteer abroad , " she told the paper , adding that existing volunteer programs often come with a hefty price tag . those working in the field generally welcomed the idea . " we think it 's a positive thing that the ministry is getting involved , " said jan gildemeister , the executive director of action committee service for peace -lrb- acsp -rrb- , an umbrella organization for christian groups that offer voluntary service programs abroad . " they want to increase awareness of development aid issues among young people and we welcome that , " he added .
" it 's the program itself that we 're concerned about . " protecting quality gildemeister said that it was important to work closely with non-governmental organizations in developing countries to make sure that they had the necessary resources to deal with volunteers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone who wants to volunteer abroad necessarily meets the requirements " you have to realize that volunteers need training and supervision , " gildemeister said , adding that it has taken acsp members years to establish ties with partner organizations abroad . carefully selecting candidates was another issue to consider , he said , counting a certain level of independence and language skills as essentials for people interested in volunteering in developing countries . " you ca n't send an 18-year-old to tanzania who 's lacking those skills , " he said , adding that he was looking forward to discussing these and other issues during a meeting with ministry officials on thursday . who benefits ? christof hartmann , a professor for development policy at the university of duisburg-essen , also questioned the usefulness of sending unskilled germans to developing countries as aid workers . " there are enough qualified people in these countries , " he said .
" if there 's a need for people , it 's for experts in selected areas , not someone who 'll help out at the hospital or can fill in excel spreadsheets . " hartmann added that young people in germany could certainly benefit from exposure to development issues . " but the question is whether we want to view this as part of our development aid policy , " he said . new experiences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experiencing the real thing helps broaden horizons ute koczy , the development aid spokeswoman for the opposition greens party in parliament , agreed that it was important to make sure that the organizations abroad found the program useful .

" but generally speaking , it 's the volunteers who benefit most from these kinds of trips .

" he said the plan would allow investigators from an eu nation for the first time to have access to a dna or fingerprint databank of crime suspects in all other eu member states .
the only prerequisite , schäuble said , would be that a formal investigation would first have to be opened . widening existing treaty schäuble 's plan is n't entirely new .
it touches upon an existing agreement called the " prüm treaty " on police cooperation which seven states have already signed . named after the western german town where it was signed in 2005 , it allows participating nations mutual and automatic access to dna and fingerprint records , as well as car registration information .
the treaty allows police to pursue fugitives across another eu state 's border in case of imminent danger to individuals .
it also allows joint police patrols . but the treaty is only operational in germany , austria and spain . " our aim is to create a modern police information network for more effective crime control throughout europe , " schäuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan will lead to more cross-border cooperation in the eu schäuble also pointed out that in the six weeks that the prüm system has been in operation , the sharing of information between germany and austria has led to 1,500 dna matches , including 32 in homicide cases and 23 in rape or sexual assault cases . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the treaty would achieve two seemingly contradictory goals - making sensitive data available to security authorities while protecting the privacy rights of eu citizens . schäuble added that the information database would be used by police forces , not national intelligence agencies . not everyone in favor the german minister said monday that most eu member states had backed the idea of enshrining the prüm treaty in eu law . " we have had a very broad consensus .
i am pleasantly surprised , " schäuble said . " dna is today the most effective means of solving crime , " said french regional development minister christian estrosi , who represented french interior minister nicolas sarkozy at the talks .
on an eu-wide level " we could solve thousands of crimes much more quickly , " he added . however eu members britain , czech republic , ireland and poland said they needed more time to think about the treaty for fear that it might be too expensive to update their existing databanks . all states need to agree for the treaty to become eu law .
the european commission will put forward a formal proposal next month . schäuble 's proposal was criticized monday by germany 's opposition free-market liberals , the fdp .
the debate among eu ministers in dresden showed " the low premium that is put on civil rights and data security in eu legal and interior policy , " said gisela piltz , fdp spokeswoman on security affairs . more cooperation with us ? schäuble also said he could n't rule out opening germany 's police databank containing dna and digital fingerprint information to the us . the minister , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said the issue was first raised by representatives of the us department of the interior in september last year in order to help in the hunt for terrorism suspects who could be hiding in germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany launches eu initiative to tackle right-wing extremism germany has put forward measures to help europe unite forces in the battle against the far-right .

ferrero-waldner spoke to dw-radio about the upcoming visit and the state of relations between the eu and china . dw : how would you sum up the current state of relations between the eu and china ? ferrero-waldner : i would say that relations are very comprehensive and very important but we also see that in our trade cooperation agreement that we have from 1985 , these strategic partnerships that we have today with china , this old agreement is no longer up to the job .
this is the reason why during this trip my main purpose is to launch negotiations for the new partnership and cooperation agreement that will be much more comprehensive and which will build on this changing relationship that we have . in real terms , what do you hope to achieve ? in real terms , i think it will be necessary to really agree on providing a comprehensive framework for the 22 sectors in which the eu and china are already holding dialogues , including energy , the environment , agriculture , transport , education , science and technology but also key issues such as sustainable development , migration and of course the international challenges we both face such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction . on the topic of energy , china is a major global polluter .
is there an implicit message from the eu which is " you must change what you are doing " ? we already have a partnership on climate change with china since september 2005 as well as various action plans and memorandums of understanding where we touch upon clean coal , energy efficiency and renewable energies in general .
but we think china is so big that whatever we do in reducing emissions could be offset by china .
therefore we think it is highly important that china take on our technologies .
for instance , clean coal technology with carbon capture because china is currently bringing one coal fired power plant online every week .
you can imagine what that means .
therefore we want to get china closely working together with us and we 're taking the lead here . what 's in this for china ? i think china itself realizes more and more , and is interested in having a development in their industry that in the end does not jeopardize the environment .
that is also in their interest . peter dobbie interviewed benita ferrero-waldner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu trade commissioner has harsh words for beijing on a visit to china , the eu 's trade commissioner has n't been mincing words .

ferrero-waldner spoke to dw-radio about the upcoming visit and the state of relations between the eu and china . dw : how would you sum up the current state of relations between the eu and china ? ferrero-waldner : i would say that relations are very comprehensive and very important but we also see that in our trade cooperation agreement that we have from 1985 , these strategic partnerships that we have today with china , this old agreement is no longer up to the job .
this is the reason why during this trip my main purpose is to launch negotiations for the new partnership and cooperation agreement that will be much more comprehensive and which will build on this changing relationship that we have . in real terms , what do you hope to achieve ? in real terms , i think it will be necessary to really agree on providing a comprehensive framework for the 22 sectors in which the eu and china are already holding dialogues , including energy , the environment , agriculture , transport , education , science and technology but also key issues such as sustainable development , migration and of course the international challenges we both face such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction . on the topic of energy , china is a major global polluter .
is there an implicit message from the eu which is " you must change what you are doing " ? we already have a partnership on climate change with china since september 2005 as well as various action plans and memorandums of understanding where we touch upon clean coal , energy efficiency and renewable energies in general .
but we think china is so big that whatever we do in reducing emissions could be offset by china .
therefore we think it is highly important that china take on our technologies .
for instance , clean coal technology with carbon capture because china is currently bringing one coal fired power plant online every week .
you can imagine what that means .
therefore we want to get china closely working together with us and we 're taking the lead here . what 's in this for china ? i think china itself realizes more and more , and is interested in having a development in their industry that in the end does not jeopardize the environment .

india 's automobile sector is currently growing at an estimated 17 percent a year . add that to an annual growth rate of almost 10 percent and it 's not difficult to see why the german car industry - which has thus far focused largely on china - is increasingly training its sights on india . daimlerchrysler , vw lead the way earlier this month , daimlerchrysler ag , the world 's second-largest luxury carmaker , said it was investing 44 million euros -lrb- $ 57 million -rrb- to build a new assembly plant in the western indian state of maharashtra .
the state is already home to factories of tata , renault and fiat spa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercedes s-class symbolizes top quality in india by 2009 , the stuttgart-based german-american carmaker - which currently assembles the e-class , c-class and s-class models in india - plans to roll out a further 5,000 luxury models a year . wolfsburg-based volkswagen last year signed a whopping deal worth 410 million euros - the single-biggest foreign investment in indian so far - with the government of maharashtra to set up a production facility on the outskirts of the rapidly growing city of pune .
the plant will manufacture the passat and other models . volkswagen 's affiliate audi ag will also begin work on producing the a6 sedan in india this year . mercedes as a status symbol " the indian car market has huge growth potential , " said thomas becker , deputy head of the german car industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- .
he pointed out that german carmakers in india saw growth rates of over 33 percent in 2006 , double the rate of the indian market as a whole . though german carmakers only have a market share of around one percent in india , becker stressed that it was changing fast given that they had a solid presence in the luxury car segment .
" it 's really important that you 're up there in the high-value segment nice and early , " he added . dilip chenoy , head of the society of indian automobile manufacturers -lrb- siam -rrb- said german carmakers are prized for their luxury cars and diesel technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign cars are a status symbol for india 's well-heeled " german cars are valued for their quality and sturdiness , " chenoy said , adding that most of them boasted sophisticated technology , a smooth drive and sleek looks and contrasted greatly with the traditional image of lumbering diesel-powered cars . chenoy added that german luxury cars had also become something of a status symbol among india 's upwardly mobile and wealthy classes . daimlerchrysler - with more than 80 percent of the market share - is the unmistakable leader in the luxury segment . " the cars are a ' statement ' and they 're the vehicle of choice for many managers , " chenoy said .
" the main buyers are big companies , " said chenoy , adding that the mercedes is usually bought by an increasingly affluent new class of entrepreneurs in northern india . problems remain despite india 's robustly growing economy and surging consumer confidence , the country 's road network , hampered by potholes and heavy congestion , still needs to be expanded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's terrible roads remain a huge barrier to foreign investment german carmakers say that strengthens the case for setting up their own production plants in india , also arguing that in light of high indian import tariffs , it makes sense to ship auto parts from germany and assemble the cars in india . " this process is usually preferred as a first step towards setting up your own production in many emerging markets , " becker said , adding that the operation in no way undermined the performance of the car or damaged germany 's high reputation for quality products . german carmakers say that one way to lower high import tariffs and dismantle other barriers to investment in india would be to set up a free-trade zone between the eu and india next year .

india 's automobile sector is currently growing at an estimated 17 percent a year . add that to an annual growth rate of almost 10 percent and it 's not difficult to see why the german car industry - which has thus far focused largely on china - is increasingly training its sights on india . daimlerchrysler , vw lead the way earlier this month , daimlerchrysler ag , the world 's second-largest luxury carmaker , said it was investing 44 million euros -lrb- $ 57 million -rrb- to build a new assembly plant in the western indian state of maharashtra .
the state is already home to factories of tata , renault and fiat spa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercedes s-class symbolizes top quality in india by 2009 , the stuttgart-based german-american carmaker - which currently assembles the e-class , c-class and s-class models in india - plans to roll out a further 5,000 luxury models a year . wolfsburg-based volkswagen last year signed a whopping deal worth 410 million euros - the single-biggest foreign investment in indian so far - with the government of maharashtra to set up a production facility on the outskirts of the rapidly growing city of pune .
the plant will manufacture the passat and other models . volkswagen 's affiliate audi ag will also begin work on producing the a6 sedan in india this year . mercedes as a status symbol " the indian car market has huge growth potential , " said thomas becker , deputy head of the german car industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- .
he pointed out that german carmakers in india saw growth rates of over 33 percent in 2006 , double the rate of the indian market as a whole . though german carmakers only have a market share of around one percent in india , becker stressed that it was changing fast given that they had a solid presence in the luxury car segment .
" it 's really important that you 're up there in the high-value segment nice and early , " he added . dilip chenoy , head of the society of indian automobile manufacturers -lrb- siam -rrb- said german carmakers are prized for their luxury cars and diesel technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign cars are a status symbol for india 's well-heeled " german cars are valued for their quality and sturdiness , " chenoy said , adding that most of them boasted sophisticated technology , a smooth drive and sleek looks and contrasted greatly with the traditional image of lumbering diesel-powered cars . chenoy added that german luxury cars had also become something of a status symbol among india 's upwardly mobile and wealthy classes . daimlerchrysler - with more than 80 percent of the market share - is the unmistakable leader in the luxury segment . " the cars are a ' statement ' and they 're the vehicle of choice for many managers , " chenoy said .
" the main buyers are big companies , " said chenoy , adding that the mercedes is usually bought by an increasingly affluent new class of entrepreneurs in northern india . problems remain despite india 's robustly growing economy and surging consumer confidence , the country 's road network , hampered by potholes and heavy congestion , still needs to be expanded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's terrible roads remain a huge barrier to foreign investment german carmakers say that strengthens the case for setting up their own production plants in india , also arguing that in light of high indian import tariffs , it makes sense to ship auto parts from germany and assemble the cars in india . " this process is usually preferred as a first step towards setting up your own production in many emerging markets , " becker said , adding that the operation in no way undermined the performance of the car or damaged germany 's high reputation for quality products . german carmakers say that one way to lower high import tariffs and dismantle other barriers to investment in india would be to set up a free-trade zone between the eu and india next year .
that would also make it easier for india to export cars and auto components to europe . ana lehmann -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automobile market ends 2006 with a bang the german car industry zoomed to record levels of exports and production last year .

" in the context of school supervision , the lawmaker can decide on rules regarding the extent to which teachers are banned from wearing external symbols and pieces of clothing that express a religious or ideological conviction while teaching , " said judge karl huber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike in france , german students are allowed to wear headscarves an islamic religious group , which brought the case to the court , claimed that the bavarian headscarf ban - which was adopted in november 2004 - was unconstitutional because it did not treat all religions as equal , outlawing only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols . the state government , on the other hand , argued that the hijab - a headscarf which is meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family - was clashing with gender equality , which is guaranteed by the constitution . this latest legal wrangle over headscarves highlights the inconsistency of bavaria 's state 's school law .
it says that no-one is allowed to wear religious symbols in the classroom - except christians and jews . all or none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is , among other things , about reconciling islam with western values the heated debate was first sparked in 2003 when germany 's federal constitutional court ruled that muslims could wear their headscarves while teaching but at the same time encouraged new laws to ban religious symbols .
eight german states , including berlin , have so far passed school laws that ban headscarves . unlike other headscarf-banning states , which saw the muslim attire as an affront to christian values , berlin decided to treat all religious symbols on an equal basis . " berlin is the only city and german state which has not only banned the headscarf , but all religious symbols in schools - that is the big difference , " said günther piening , who is the berlin commissioner for integration and migration . " i think that 's the only way to do it , because the general ban does not discriminate against one religion , " he added .
" it abides by the principle of equality as laid down in the german constitution . " women 's rights groups and conservative politicians , however , argue that many moslem women have no choice but to wear a headscarf because their families demand it .
yet , according to a recent survey conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , 97 percent of those women asked said it was the duty of a muslim woman to cover her head and that they should be allowed to wear them wherever and whenever they choose - an opinion not shared by the vast majority of germans . not a political statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz sees the headscarf as a sign of separation and unwillingness to integrate according to the deputy secretary general of the konrad adenauer foundation , christoph kannengiesser , the wearing of a headscarf is not necessarily a political statement and it should not stop the communication between muslims and germans . " we must not allow muslim women to separate themselves from german society , " kannengiesser said .
" we have to work harder to integrate them and the women also have to be willing to integrate .
muslims , however , are part of german society and we have to accept it if muslim girls and women choose to wear the headscarf . " the headscarf debate remains a political hot potato .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has repeatedly called on moslems to accept different opinions on the role of women and the wearing of headscarves . a few months ago , ekin deligöz , an ethnic turk and member of the green party in the german parliament , was placed under police protection after receiving death threats because she called on moslem women to take off their headscarves .

" berlin is the only city and german state which has not only banned the headscarf , but all religious symbols in schools - that is the big difference , " said günther piening , who is the berlin commissioner for integration and migration .

muslims , however , are part of german society and we have to accept it if muslim girls and women choose to wear the headscarf . " the headscarf debate remains a political hot potato .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has repeatedly called on moslems to accept different opinions on the role of women and the wearing of headscarves . a few months ago , ekin deligöz , an ethnic turk and member of the green party in the german parliament , was placed under police protection after receiving death threats because she called on moslem women to take off their headscarves .

" he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .
" sarkozy , the quintessential macho , is usually quick and without scruples bordering brutality when he 's trying to hit an opponent .
his ability to punch has worked well in a political world dominated by men .
it wo n't be of much use against madame royal . " der tagesspiegel in berlin opined that it was time for president jacques chirac to rally behind his party colleague : " sarkozy 's nomination is a last defeat for chirac , who has done everything to prevent this .
but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .
both have remained political outsiders , who will have to fight against the establishment . "
" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .
ms royal also offers france and europe a break from the political past .
but her socially inclusive and pragmatic approach offers her country and our continent a much more constructive and trustworthy way forward than mr sarkozy 's . "
the times of london saw things differently .
" it is now official : in their next presidential election , french voters will face a choice between mr sarkozy 's pugnacious style and - he promises - uncompromising reforms , and the sweeping , sentimental generalities of segolene royal , the first woman to run for the elysee palace .
it is , in essence , a choice between a long-delayed and sorely-needed dose of gallic thatcherism , and a romantic reaffirmation of the socialist consensus that has cosseted the french public sector for so long that even france 's long-suffering taxpayers can no longer afford it .
both options are revolutionary , but the latter is revolutionary only because ms royal is a woman .
indeed , she has said that a win for her campaign would be a ' revolutionary gesture , ' and 40 per cent of voters have apparently opined in polls that her principal strength is her gender ... mr sarkozy , meanwhile , is walking a political tightrope .
he will need the votes of many on the right who backed jean marie le pen and the national front in 2002 , and he has already signalled that he favours a robust immigration policy .
but he can not afford to lose the entire immigrant vote in the process , and has floated positive discrimination schemes in a bid to broaden his appeal .
they would have helped his immigrant father , and if they help him to become president , that would help france . "
and in paris , liberation commented : " yes , this man is dangerous , especially for the left .
he is not the caesar nor the napolean that one sometimes sees in him .
elected in a referendum by a large majority of his camp , interior minister sarkozy is his own master and steers the ship of modern conservatism .
energy , talent and organization have helped him to this triumph .
he 's got a tight grip on things and that 's worrying .
the danger is now well-known .

" he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .
" sarkozy , the quintessential macho , is usually quick and without scruples bordering brutality when he 's trying to hit an opponent .
his ability to punch has worked well in a political world dominated by men .
it wo n't be of much use against madame royal . " der tagesspiegel in berlin opined that it was time for president jacques chirac to rally behind his party colleague : " sarkozy 's nomination is a last defeat for chirac , who has done everything to prevent this .
but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .
both have remained political outsiders , who will have to fight against the establishment . "
" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .
ms royal also offers france and europe a break from the political past .
but her socially inclusive and pragmatic approach offers her country and our continent a much more constructive and trustworthy way forward than mr sarkozy 's . "
the times of london saw things differently .
" it is now official : in their next presidential election , french voters will face a choice between mr sarkozy 's pugnacious style and - he promises - uncompromising reforms , and the sweeping , sentimental generalities of segolene royal , the first woman to run for the elysee palace .
it is , in essence , a choice between a long-delayed and sorely-needed dose of gallic thatcherism , and a romantic reaffirmation of the socialist consensus that has cosseted the french public sector for so long that even france 's long-suffering taxpayers can no longer afford it .
both options are revolutionary , but the latter is revolutionary only because ms royal is a woman .
indeed , she has said that a win for her campaign would be a ' revolutionary gesture , ' and 40 per cent of voters have apparently opined in polls that her principal strength is her gender ... mr sarkozy , meanwhile , is walking a political tightrope .

illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .
he 's hoping to convince his counterparts that a central eu data base on crime is urgently needed . fighting crime and reforming laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries is in the mood for reforms meanwhile , german justice minister brigitte zypries , for her part , wants to promote tougher legislation against racially motivated crimes , including the denial of the holocaust .
a german proposal seeks to criminalize all racist declarations that incite violence against a single person or specific group of people . but the german justice minister also called for harmonization of a wide range of other legal issues .
she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .
in addition , there are about one million divorces in the eu each year , and 20 percent of them involve people from two different european nations .
so , there 's a dire need to have clearer legislation as to how to deal with such transnational cases in the bloc . " the dresden meeting of eu interior and justice ministers is an informal one , so no immediate policy changes are expected .
it is hoped though that many of the proposals made in dresden will be turned into law later this year . hardy graupner / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , african officials discuss immigration ministers from more than 50 eu and african countries are expected to conclude a conference in the libyan capital tripoli on migration flows and development with a joint declaration on migration issues .

illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .
he 's hoping to convince his counterparts that a central eu data base on crime is urgently needed . fighting crime and reforming laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries is in the mood for reforms meanwhile , german justice minister brigitte zypries , for her part , wants to promote tougher legislation against racially motivated crimes , including the denial of the holocaust .
a german proposal seeks to criminalize all racist declarations that incite violence against a single person or specific group of people . but the german justice minister also called for harmonization of a wide range of other legal issues .
she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .
in addition , there are about one million divorces in the eu each year , and 20 percent of them involve people from two different european nations .
so , there 's a dire need to have clearer legislation as to how to deal with such transnational cases in the bloc . " the dresden meeting of eu interior and justice ministers is an informal one , so no immediate policy changes are expected .

dw 's ute schaeffer says germany and europe urgently need to rethink their policy towards africa . ghana - the country that german president horst köhler just visited for four days - is for african standards a model state .
the country 's progress , however , is still governed by foreign factors , both old and new .
traditionally , african development has been influenced by donor nations in europe and the usa .

europe should become more aware of its own interests in africa , including , for example , the issue of energy .

india 's automobile sector is currently growing at an estimated 17 percent a year . add that to an annual growth rate of almost 10 percent and it 's not difficult to see why the german car industry - which has thus far focused largely on china - is increasingly training its sights on india . daimlerchrysler , vw lead the way earlier this month , daimlerchrysler ag , the world 's second-largest luxury carmaker , said it was investing 44 million euros -lrb- $ 57 million -rrb- to build a new assembly plant in the western indian state of maharashtra .

india 's automobile sector is currently growing at an estimated 17 percent a year . add that to an annual growth rate of almost 10 percent and it 's not difficult to see why the german car industry - which has thus far focused largely on china - is increasingly training its sights on india . daimlerchrysler , vw lead the way earlier this month , daimlerchrysler ag , the world 's second-largest luxury carmaker , said it was investing 44 million euros -lrb- $ 57 million -rrb- to build a new assembly plant in the western indian state of maharashtra .
the state is already home to factories of tata , renault and fiat spa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercedes s-class symbolizes top quality in india by 2009 , the stuttgart-based german-american carmaker - which currently assembles the e-class , c-class and s-class models in india - plans to roll out a further 5,000 luxury models a year . wolfsburg-based volkswagen last year signed a whopping deal worth 410 million euros - the single-biggest foreign investment in indian so far - with the government of maharashtra to set up a production facility on the outskirts of the rapidly growing city of pune .
the plant will manufacture the passat and other models . volkswagen 's affiliate audi ag will also begin work on producing the a6 sedan in india this year . mercedes as a status symbol " the indian car market has huge growth potential , " said thomas becker , deputy head of the german car industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- .

ferrero-waldner spoke to dw-radio about the upcoming visit and the state of relations between the eu and china . dw : how would you sum up the current state of relations between the eu and china ? ferrero-waldner : i would say that relations are very comprehensive and very important but we also see that in our trade cooperation agreement that we have from 1985 , these strategic partnerships that we have today with china , this old agreement is no longer up to the job .
this is the reason why during this trip my main purpose is to launch negotiations for the new partnership and cooperation agreement that will be much more comprehensive and which will build on this changing relationship that we have . in real terms , what do you hope to achieve ? in real terms , i think it will be necessary to really agree on providing a comprehensive framework for the 22 sectors in which the eu and china are already holding dialogues , including energy , the environment , agriculture , transport , education , science and technology but also key issues such as sustainable development , migration and of course the international challenges we both face such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction . on the topic of energy , china is a major global polluter .
is there an implicit message from the eu which is " you must change what you are doing " ? we already have a partnership on climate change with china since september 2005 as well as various action plans and memorandums of understanding where we touch upon clean coal , energy efficiency and renewable energies in general .
but we think china is so big that whatever we do in reducing emissions could be offset by china .
therefore we think it is highly important that china take on our technologies .
for instance , clean coal technology with carbon capture because china is currently bringing one coal fired power plant online every week .
you can imagine what that means .
therefore we want to get china closely working together with us and we 're taking the lead here . what 's in this for china ? i think china itself realizes more and more , and is interested in having a development in their industry that in the end does not jeopardize the environment .

dw 's ute schaeffer says germany and europe urgently need to rethink their policy towards africa . ghana - the country that german president horst köhler just visited for four days - is for african standards a model state .
the country 's progress , however , is still governed by foreign factors , both old and new .
traditionally , african development has been influenced by donor nations in europe and the usa .
more recently , the emerging economies of india and china have become factors of influence as well .
chinese investments in ghana , for instance , have long exceeded those of great britain .
china is pushing its way into the west african state with all its might . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer globalization and rapid growth of the emerging economies have outrun the classical , european type of development policy .
africa is now part of a new international architecture . ghanaians living abroad transfer up to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to their homeland every year , making a significant contribution to its economic growth .
in ghana , like in other parts of africa , doors remain wide open for china and india . europe has so far missed on this development and that 's what the german president is concerned about .
the old development recipes are no longer effective .
europe 's outdated africa policy , in which everybody takes care of their own , personal africa , should be dead and buried .
how long does europe think it can keep its markets protected from african products ?
how long can europe keep believing that it can prevent migration from the neighboring continent using high walls , border controls or reception camps in the north african desert ? the european policy toward africa , which is shaped by fear and protectionism , is limiting africa 's potential that others have long noticed and taken advantage of .
europe should become more aware of its own interests in africa , including , for example , the issue of energy .
at the moment , africa produces 12 percent of the world 's crude oil supplies .
by 2010 , that amount will double .
the continent has over 50 million tons of natural gas at its disposal , which is one third of the deposits in the world . africa 's unused potentials include its manpower .
europe needs immigrants as well temporary foreign workers .
migrations - from africa and elsewhere - must be legalized and africans , too , must be allowed temporary entry to europe .
not the least because africa is a growing market that countries like china and india have long noticed and started exploiting .
africa is developing quickly .
ghana is a case in point . europe should not hand its neighbor continent over to china .
it is important to establish wide-ranging connections , social contacts and networks to get to know each other so that everybody can recognize their common interest .
the german president knows this , which is why he has launched his africa initiative .
with his continuing engagement and his third trip to africa , he wants to make sure that africa remains on the german government 's agenda . germany could set certain things in motion for africa , both in the eu and at the g8 summit .
this could happen in theory at least , since other topics - the constitutional process or relations to central asia - are seen as the more urgent priorities of the german eu presidency .
the german government , however , is planning to address the issues of african economic conditions and development at the g8 level .
is that the first sign that the old europe is waking up and beginning to see its own chances in africa ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 15.01.2007 illegal migration high on new eu presidency 's agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many more illegal migrants from africa will risk the hazardous journey to europe this spring with germany now president of the european union , the city of dresden hosts the first informal meeting of eu interior and justice ministers of the new presidency monday .
illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run .

illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .

india 's automobile sector is currently growing at an estimated 17 percent a year . add that to an annual growth rate of almost 10 percent and it 's not difficult to see why the german car industry - which has thus far focused largely on china - is increasingly training its sights on india . daimlerchrysler , vw lead the way earlier this month , daimlerchrysler ag , the world 's second-largest luxury carmaker , said it was investing 44 million euros -lrb- $ 57 million -rrb- to build a new assembly plant in the western indian state of maharashtra .
the state is already home to factories of tata , renault and fiat spa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercedes s-class symbolizes top quality in india by 2009 , the stuttgart-based german-american carmaker - which currently assembles the e-class , c-class and s-class models in india - plans to roll out a further 5,000 luxury models a year . wolfsburg-based volkswagen last year signed a whopping deal worth 410 million euros - the single-biggest foreign investment in indian so far - with the government of maharashtra to set up a production facility on the outskirts of the rapidly growing city of pune .
the plant will manufacture the passat and other models . volkswagen 's affiliate audi ag will also begin work on producing the a6 sedan in india this year . mercedes as a status symbol " the indian car market has huge growth potential , " said thomas becker , deputy head of the german car industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- .
he pointed out that german carmakers in india saw growth rates of over 33 percent in 2006 , double the rate of the indian market as a whole . though german carmakers only have a market share of around one percent in india , becker stressed that it was changing fast given that they had a solid presence in the luxury car segment .
" it 's really important that you 're up there in the high-value segment nice and early , " he added . dilip chenoy , head of the society of indian automobile manufacturers -lrb- siam -rrb- said german carmakers are prized for their luxury cars and diesel technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign cars are a status symbol for india 's well-heeled " german cars are valued for their quality and sturdiness , " chenoy said , adding that most of them boasted sophisticated technology , a smooth drive and sleek looks and contrasted greatly with the traditional image of lumbering diesel-powered cars . chenoy added that german luxury cars had also become something of a status symbol among india 's upwardly mobile and wealthy classes . daimlerchrysler - with more than 80 percent of the market share - is the unmistakable leader in the luxury segment . " the cars are a ' statement ' and they 're the vehicle of choice for many managers , " chenoy said .
" the main buyers are big companies , " said chenoy , adding that the mercedes is usually bought by an increasingly affluent new class of entrepreneurs in northern india . problems remain despite india 's robustly growing economy and surging consumer confidence , the country 's road network , hampered by potholes and heavy congestion , still needs to be expanded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's terrible roads remain a huge barrier to foreign investment german carmakers say that strengthens the case for setting up their own production plants in india , also arguing that in light of high indian import tariffs , it makes sense to ship auto parts from germany and assemble the cars in india . " this process is usually preferred as a first step towards setting up your own production in many emerging markets , " becker said , adding that the operation in no way undermined the performance of the car or damaged germany 's high reputation for quality products . german carmakers say that one way to lower high import tariffs and dismantle other barriers to investment in india would be to set up a free-trade zone between the eu and india next year .
that would also make it easier for india to export cars and auto components to europe . ana lehmann -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automobile market ends 2006 with a bang the german car industry zoomed to record levels of exports and production last year .
the country also saw a surge of new passenger car registrations - mainly a result of buyers rushing to beat a tax hike .
-lrb- 06.01.2007 -rrb- volkswagen signs deal to build car in indian manufacturing hub volkswagen , europe 's leading automaker , signed a deal to build a 410 million euro -lrb- $ 539 million -rrb- plant in western india at a site state officials said will become " the detroit of india .

illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .
he 's hoping to convince his counterparts that a central eu data base on crime is urgently needed . fighting crime and reforming laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries is in the mood for reforms meanwhile , german justice minister brigitte zypries , for her part , wants to promote tougher legislation against racially motivated crimes , including the denial of the holocaust .
a german proposal seeks to criminalize all racist declarations that incite violence against a single person or specific group of people . but the german justice minister also called for harmonization of a wide range of other legal issues .
she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .
in addition , there are about one million divorces in the eu each year , and 20 percent of them involve people from two different european nations .
so , there 's a dire need to have clearer legislation as to how to deal with such transnational cases in the bloc . " the dresden meeting of eu interior and justice ministers is an informal one , so no immediate policy changes are expected .
it is hoped though that many of the proposals made in dresden will be turned into law later this year . hardy graupner / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , african officials discuss immigration ministers from more than 50 eu and african countries are expected to conclude a conference in the libyan capital tripoli on migration flows and development with a joint declaration on migration issues .

" he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .

but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .

" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .

dw 's ute schaeffer says germany and europe urgently need to rethink their policy towards africa . ghana - the country that german president horst köhler just visited for four days - is for african standards a model state .
the country 's progress , however , is still governed by foreign factors , both old and new .
traditionally , african development has been influenced by donor nations in europe and the usa .
more recently , the emerging economies of india and china have become factors of influence as well .
chinese investments in ghana , for instance , have long exceeded those of great britain .
china is pushing its way into the west african state with all its might . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer globalization and rapid growth of the emerging economies have outrun the classical , european type of development policy .
africa is now part of a new international architecture . ghanaians living abroad transfer up to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to their homeland every year , making a significant contribution to its economic growth .
in ghana , like in other parts of africa , doors remain wide open for china and india . europe has so far missed on this development and that 's what the german president is concerned about .
the old development recipes are no longer effective .
europe 's outdated africa policy , in which everybody takes care of their own , personal africa , should be dead and buried .
how long does europe think it can keep its markets protected from african products ?
how long can europe keep believing that it can prevent migration from the neighboring continent using high walls , border controls or reception camps in the north african desert ? the european policy toward africa , which is shaped by fear and protectionism , is limiting africa 's potential that others have long noticed and taken advantage of .
europe should become more aware of its own interests in africa , including , for example , the issue of energy .
at the moment , africa produces 12 percent of the world 's crude oil supplies .
by 2010 , that amount will double .
the continent has over 50 million tons of natural gas at its disposal , which is one third of the deposits in the world . africa 's unused potentials include its manpower .
europe needs immigrants as well temporary foreign workers .
migrations - from africa and elsewhere - must be legalized and africans , too , must be allowed temporary entry to europe .
not the least because africa is a growing market that countries like china and india have long noticed and started exploiting .
africa is developing quickly .
ghana is a case in point . europe should not hand its neighbor continent over to china .
it is important to establish wide-ranging connections , social contacts and networks to get to know each other so that everybody can recognize their common interest .
the german president knows this , which is why he has launched his africa initiative .
with his continuing engagement and his third trip to africa , he wants to make sure that africa remains on the german government 's agenda . germany could set certain things in motion for africa , both in the eu and at the g8 summit .
this could happen in theory at least , since other topics - the constitutional process or relations to central asia - are seen as the more urgent priorities of the german eu presidency .
the german government , however , is planning to address the issues of african economic conditions and development at the g8 level .
is that the first sign that the old europe is waking up and beginning to see its own chances in africa ?
perhaps , though not definitely . ute schaeffer is head of dw-radio 's africa program -lrb- tt -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de illegal migration high on new eu presidency 's agenda with germany now president of the european union , the city of dresden hosts the first informal meeting of eu interior and justice ministers of the new presidency monday .
illegal migration is high on the agenda .

dw 's ute schaeffer says germany and europe urgently need to rethink their policy towards africa . ghana - the country that german president horst köhler just visited for four days - is for african standards a model state .
the country 's progress , however , is still governed by foreign factors , both old and new .
traditionally , african development has been influenced by donor nations in europe and the usa .
more recently , the emerging economies of india and china have become factors of influence as well .
chinese investments in ghana , for instance , have long exceeded those of great britain .
china is pushing its way into the west african state with all its might . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer globalization and rapid growth of the emerging economies have outrun the classical , european type of development policy .
africa is now part of a new international architecture . ghanaians living abroad transfer up to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to their homeland every year , making a significant contribution to its economic growth .
in ghana , like in other parts of africa , doors remain wide open for china and india . europe has so far missed on this development and that 's what the german president is concerned about .
the old development recipes are no longer effective .
europe 's outdated africa policy , in which everybody takes care of their own , personal africa , should be dead and buried .
how long does europe think it can keep its markets protected from african products ?
how long can europe keep believing that it can prevent migration from the neighboring continent using high walls , border controls or reception camps in the north african desert ? the european policy toward africa , which is shaped by fear and protectionism , is limiting africa 's potential that others have long noticed and taken advantage of .
europe should become more aware of its own interests in africa , including , for example , the issue of energy .
at the moment , africa produces 12 percent of the world 's crude oil supplies .
by 2010 , that amount will double .
the continent has over 50 million tons of natural gas at its disposal , which is one third of the deposits in the world . africa 's unused potentials include its manpower .
europe needs immigrants as well temporary foreign workers .
migrations - from africa and elsewhere - must be legalized and africans , too , must be allowed temporary entry to europe .
not the least because africa is a growing market that countries like china and india have long noticed and started exploiting .
africa is developing quickly .
ghana is a case in point . europe should not hand its neighbor continent over to china .
it is important to establish wide-ranging connections , social contacts and networks to get to know each other so that everybody can recognize their common interest .
the german president knows this , which is why he has launched his africa initiative .
with his continuing engagement and his third trip to africa , he wants to make sure that africa remains on the german government 's agenda . germany could set certain things in motion for africa , both in the eu and at the g8 summit .
this could happen in theory at least , since other topics - the constitutional process or relations to central asia - are seen as the more urgent priorities of the german eu presidency .
the german government , however , is planning to address the issues of african economic conditions and development at the g8 level .

dw 's ute schaeffer says germany and europe urgently need to rethink their policy towards africa . ghana - the country that german president horst köhler just visited for four days - is for african standards a model state .
the country 's progress , however , is still governed by foreign factors , both old and new .
traditionally , african development has been influenced by donor nations in europe and the usa .
more recently , the emerging economies of india and china have become factors of influence as well .
chinese investments in ghana , for instance , have long exceeded those of great britain .
china is pushing its way into the west african state with all its might . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer globalization and rapid growth of the emerging economies have outrun the classical , european type of development policy .
africa is now part of a new international architecture . ghanaians living abroad transfer up to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to their homeland every year , making a significant contribution to its economic growth .
in ghana , like in other parts of africa , doors remain wide open for china and india . europe has so far missed on this development and that 's what the german president is concerned about .
the old development recipes are no longer effective .
europe 's outdated africa policy , in which everybody takes care of their own , personal africa , should be dead and buried .
how long does europe think it can keep its markets protected from african products ?
how long can europe keep believing that it can prevent migration from the neighboring continent using high walls , border controls or reception camps in the north african desert ? the european policy toward africa , which is shaped by fear and protectionism , is limiting africa 's potential that others have long noticed and taken advantage of .
europe should become more aware of its own interests in africa , including , for example , the issue of energy .
at the moment , africa produces 12 percent of the world 's crude oil supplies .
by 2010 , that amount will double .
the continent has over 50 million tons of natural gas at its disposal , which is one third of the deposits in the world . africa 's unused potentials include its manpower .
europe needs immigrants as well temporary foreign workers .
migrations - from africa and elsewhere - must be legalized and africans , too , must be allowed temporary entry to europe .
not the least because africa is a growing market that countries like china and india have long noticed and started exploiting .
africa is developing quickly .
ghana is a case in point . europe should not hand its neighbor continent over to china .
it is important to establish wide-ranging connections , social contacts and networks to get to know each other so that everybody can recognize their common interest .
the german president knows this , which is why he has launched his africa initiative .
with his continuing engagement and his third trip to africa , he wants to make sure that africa remains on the german government 's agenda . germany could set certain things in motion for africa , both in the eu and at the g8 summit .
this could happen in theory at least , since other topics - the constitutional process or relations to central asia - are seen as the more urgent priorities of the german eu presidency .
the german government , however , is planning to address the issues of african economic conditions and development at the g8 level .
is that the first sign that the old europe is waking up and beginning to see its own chances in africa ?
perhaps , though not definitely . ute schaeffer is head of dw-radio 's africa program -lrb- tt -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de illegal migration high on new eu presidency 's agenda with germany now president of the european union , the city of dresden hosts the first informal meeting of eu interior and justice ministers of the new presidency monday .

hoping to increase awareness for development issues , germany plans to introduce a new volunteer service for young people in 2008 .
most experts welcomed the idea in principle , but expressed concerns about logistics . when german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul recently announced her plan for a new voluntary service abroad program , she said she was simply reacting to an unmet demand . " every day , we are hearing from young people who want to do something , " the social democrat told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
" we want to respond to this desire to do something . " wieczorek-zeul 's response is aimed at people between the ages of 18 and 28 , who have a high school diploma or equivalent certificate and want to work in a developing country for three to 24 months . the ministry offers to pay 580 euros -lrb- $ 752 -rrb- per month to cover living costs .
in total , wieczorek-zeul plans to earmark 70 million euros for 10,000 participants .
the money will not come from existing programs , but new funds , according to a ministry spokesman . providing the means to volunteer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " we want teenagers , whose families do not have the means , to be able to volunteer abroad , " she told the paper , adding that existing volunteer programs often come with a hefty price tag . those working in the field generally welcomed the idea . " we think it 's a positive thing that the ministry is getting involved , " said jan gildemeister , the executive director of action committee service for peace -lrb- acsp -rrb- , an umbrella organization for christian groups that offer voluntary service programs abroad . " they want to increase awareness of development aid issues among young people and we welcome that , " he added .
" it 's the program itself that we 're concerned about . " protecting quality gildemeister said that it was important to work closely with non-governmental organizations in developing countries to make sure that they had the necessary resources to deal with volunteers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone who wants to volunteer abroad necessarily meets the requirements " you have to realize that volunteers need training and supervision , " gildemeister said , adding that it has taken acsp members years to establish ties with partner organizations abroad . carefully selecting candidates was another issue to consider , he said , counting a certain level of independence and language skills as essentials for people interested in volunteering in developing countries . " you ca n't send an 18-year-old to tanzania who 's lacking those skills , " he said , adding that he was looking forward to discussing these and other issues during a meeting with ministry officials on thursday . who benefits ? christof hartmann , a professor for development policy at the university of duisburg-essen , also questioned the usefulness of sending unskilled germans to developing countries as aid workers . " there are enough qualified people in these countries , " he said .
" if there 's a need for people , it 's for experts in selected areas , not someone who 'll help out at the hospital or can fill in excel spreadsheets . " hartmann added that young people in germany could certainly benefit from exposure to development issues . " but the question is whether we want to view this as part of our development aid policy , " he said . new experiences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experiencing the real thing helps broaden horizons ute koczy , the development aid spokeswoman for the opposition greens party in parliament , agreed that it was important to make sure that the organizations abroad found the program useful . " it can not be that only youngsters get something out of it , " she said .
" but generally speaking , it 's the volunteers who benefit most from these kinds of trips .
it 's good to give young people the opportunity to get a taste of the world , but they should n't expect to change it within the course of three months . " mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as state shrinks , can volunteers fill gaps ?

" he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .
" sarkozy , the quintessential macho , is usually quick and without scruples bordering brutality when he 's trying to hit an opponent .
his ability to punch has worked well in a political world dominated by men .
it wo n't be of much use against madame royal . " der tagesspiegel in berlin opined that it was time for president jacques chirac to rally behind his party colleague : " sarkozy 's nomination is a last defeat for chirac , who has done everything to prevent this .
but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .
both have remained political outsiders , who will have to fight against the establishment . "
" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .
ms royal also offers france and europe a break from the political past .
but her socially inclusive and pragmatic approach offers her country and our continent a much more constructive and trustworthy way forward than mr sarkozy 's . "
the times of london saw things differently .
" it is now official : in their next presidential election , french voters will face a choice between mr sarkozy 's pugnacious style and - he promises - uncompromising reforms , and the sweeping , sentimental generalities of segolene royal , the first woman to run for the elysee palace .
it is , in essence , a choice between a long-delayed and sorely-needed dose of gallic thatcherism , and a romantic reaffirmation of the socialist consensus that has cosseted the french public sector for so long that even france 's long-suffering taxpayers can no longer afford it .
both options are revolutionary , but the latter is revolutionary only because ms royal is a woman .
indeed , she has said that a win for her campaign would be a ' revolutionary gesture , ' and 40 per cent of voters have apparently opined in polls that her principal strength is her gender ... mr sarkozy , meanwhile , is walking a political tightrope .
he will need the votes of many on the right who backed jean marie le pen and the national front in 2002 , and he has already signalled that he favours a robust immigration policy .
but he can not afford to lose the entire immigrant vote in the process , and has floated positive discrimination schemes in a bid to broaden his appeal .
they would have helped his immigrant father , and if they help him to become president , that would help france . "
and in paris , liberation commented : " yes , this man is dangerous , especially for the left .
he is not the caesar nor the napolean that one sometimes sees in him .
elected in a referendum by a large majority of his camp , interior minister sarkozy is his own master and steers the ship of modern conservatism .
energy , talent and organization have helped him to this triumph .
he 's got a tight grip on things and that 's worrying .
the danger is now well-known .
a champ , who rules the media as much as himself , the state , his speech and a horrifying machinery .

" he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .
" sarkozy , the quintessential macho , is usually quick and without scruples bordering brutality when he 's trying to hit an opponent .
his ability to punch has worked well in a political world dominated by men .
it wo n't be of much use against madame royal . " der tagesspiegel in berlin opined that it was time for president jacques chirac to rally behind his party colleague : " sarkozy 's nomination is a last defeat for chirac , who has done everything to prevent this .
but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .
both have remained political outsiders , who will have to fight against the establishment . "
" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .
ms royal also offers france and europe a break from the political past .
but her socially inclusive and pragmatic approach offers her country and our continent a much more constructive and trustworthy way forward than mr sarkozy 's . "
the times of london saw things differently .
" it is now official : in their next presidential election , french voters will face a choice between mr sarkozy 's pugnacious style and - he promises - uncompromising reforms , and the sweeping , sentimental generalities of segolene royal , the first woman to run for the elysee palace .
it is , in essence , a choice between a long-delayed and sorely-needed dose of gallic thatcherism , and a romantic reaffirmation of the socialist consensus that has cosseted the french public sector for so long that even france 's long-suffering taxpayers can no longer afford it .
both options are revolutionary , but the latter is revolutionary only because ms royal is a woman .
indeed , she has said that a win for her campaign would be a ' revolutionary gesture , ' and 40 per cent of voters have apparently opined in polls that her principal strength is her gender ... mr sarkozy , meanwhile , is walking a political tightrope .
he will need the votes of many on the right who backed jean marie le pen and the national front in 2002 , and he has already signalled that he favours a robust immigration policy .
but he can not afford to lose the entire immigrant vote in the process , and has floated positive discrimination schemes in a bid to broaden his appeal .
they would have helped his immigrant father , and if they help him to become president , that would help france . "
and in paris , liberation commented : " yes , this man is dangerous , especially for the left .
he is not the caesar nor the napolean that one sometimes sees in him .
elected in a referendum by a large majority of his camp , interior minister sarkozy is his own master and steers the ship of modern conservatism .
energy , talent and organization have helped him to this triumph .

" he said the plan would allow investigators from an eu nation for the first time to have access to a dna or fingerprint databank of crime suspects in all other eu member states .
the only prerequisite , schäuble said , would be that a formal investigation would first have to be opened . widening existing treaty schäuble 's plan is n't entirely new .
it touches upon an existing agreement called the " prüm treaty " on police cooperation which seven states have already signed . named after the western german town where it was signed in 2005 , it allows participating nations mutual and automatic access to dna and fingerprint records , as well as car registration information .
the treaty allows police to pursue fugitives across another eu state 's border in case of imminent danger to individuals .
it also allows joint police patrols . but the treaty is only operational in germany , austria and spain . " our aim is to create a modern police information network for more effective crime control throughout europe , " schäuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan will lead to more cross-border cooperation in the eu schäuble also pointed out that in the six weeks that the prüm system has been in operation , the sharing of information between germany and austria has led to 1,500 dna matches , including 32 in homicide cases and 23 in rape or sexual assault cases . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the treaty would achieve two seemingly contradictory goals - making sensitive data available to security authorities while protecting the privacy rights of eu citizens . schäuble added that the information database would be used by police forces , not national intelligence agencies . not everyone in favor the german minister said monday that most eu member states had backed the idea of enshrining the prüm treaty in eu law . " we have had a very broad consensus .
i am pleasantly surprised , " schäuble said . " dna is today the most effective means of solving crime , " said french regional development minister christian estrosi , who represented french interior minister nicolas sarkozy at the talks .
on an eu-wide level " we could solve thousands of crimes much more quickly , " he added . however eu members britain , czech republic , ireland and poland said they needed more time to think about the treaty for fear that it might be too expensive to update their existing databanks . all states need to agree for the treaty to become eu law .
the european commission will put forward a formal proposal next month . schäuble 's proposal was criticized monday by germany 's opposition free-market liberals , the fdp .
the debate among eu ministers in dresden showed " the low premium that is put on civil rights and data security in eu legal and interior policy , " said gisela piltz , fdp spokeswoman on security affairs . more cooperation with us ? schäuble also said he could n't rule out opening germany 's police databank containing dna and digital fingerprint information to the us . the minister , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said the issue was first raised by representatives of the us department of the interior in september last year in order to help in the hunt for terrorism suspects who could be hiding in germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany launches eu initiative to tackle right-wing extremism germany has put forward measures to help europe unite forces in the battle against the far-right .

the only prerequisite , schäuble said , would be that a formal investigation would first have to be opened . widening existing treaty schäuble 's plan is n't entirely new .
it touches upon an existing agreement called the " prüm treaty " on police cooperation which seven states have already signed . named after the western german town where it was signed in 2005 , it allows participating nations mutual and automatic access to dna and fingerprint records , as well as car registration information .
the treaty allows police to pursue fugitives across another eu state 's border in case of imminent danger to individuals .
it also allows joint police patrols . but the treaty is only operational in germany , austria and spain . " our aim is to create a modern police information network for more effective crime control throughout europe , " schäuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan will lead to more cross-border cooperation in the eu schäuble also pointed out that in the six weeks that the prüm system has been in operation , the sharing of information between germany and austria has led to 1,500 dna matches , including 32 in homicide cases and 23 in rape or sexual assault cases . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the treaty would achieve two seemingly contradictory goals - making sensitive data available to security authorities while protecting the privacy rights of eu citizens . schäuble added that the information database would be used by police forces , not national intelligence agencies . not everyone in favor the german minister said monday that most eu member states had backed the idea of enshrining the prüm treaty in eu law . " we have had a very broad consensus .
i am pleasantly surprised , " schäuble said . " dna is today the most effective means of solving crime , " said french regional development minister christian estrosi , who represented french interior minister nicolas sarkozy at the talks .
on an eu-wide level " we could solve thousands of crimes much more quickly , " he added . however eu members britain , czech republic , ireland and poland said they needed more time to think about the treaty for fear that it might be too expensive to update their existing databanks . all states need to agree for the treaty to become eu law .
the european commission will put forward a formal proposal next month . schäuble 's proposal was criticized monday by germany 's opposition free-market liberals , the fdp .
the debate among eu ministers in dresden showed " the low premium that is put on civil rights and data security in eu legal and interior policy , " said gisela piltz , fdp spokeswoman on security affairs . more cooperation with us ? schäuble also said he could n't rule out opening germany 's police databank containing dna and digital fingerprint information to the us . the minister , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said the issue was first raised by representatives of the us department of the interior in september last year in order to help in the hunt for terrorism suspects who could be hiding in germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany launches eu initiative to tackle right-wing extremism germany has put forward measures to help europe unite forces in the battle against the far-right .

" in the context of school supervision , the lawmaker can decide on rules regarding the extent to which teachers are banned from wearing external symbols and pieces of clothing that express a religious or ideological conviction while teaching , " said judge karl huber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike in france , german students are allowed to wear headscarves an islamic religious group , which brought the case to the court , claimed that the bavarian headscarf ban - which was adopted in november 2004 - was unconstitutional because it did not treat all religions as equal , outlawing only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols . the state government , on the other hand , argued that the hijab - a headscarf which is meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family - was clashing with gender equality , which is guaranteed by the constitution . this latest legal wrangle over headscarves highlights the inconsistency of bavaria 's state 's school law .
it says that no-one is allowed to wear religious symbols in the classroom - except christians and jews . all or none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is , among other things , about reconciling islam with western values the heated debate was first sparked in 2003 when germany 's federal constitutional court ruled that muslims could wear their headscarves while teaching but at the same time encouraged new laws to ban religious symbols .
eight german states , including berlin , have so far passed school laws that ban headscarves . unlike other headscarf-banning states , which saw the muslim attire as an affront to christian values , berlin decided to treat all religious symbols on an equal basis . " berlin is the only city and german state which has not only banned the headscarf , but all religious symbols in schools - that is the big difference , " said günther piening , who is the berlin commissioner for integration and migration . " i think that 's the only way to do it , because the general ban does not discriminate against one religion , " he added .
" it abides by the principle of equality as laid down in the german constitution . " women 's rights groups and conservative politicians , however , argue that many moslem women have no choice but to wear a headscarf because their families demand it .
yet , according to a recent survey conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , 97 percent of those women asked said it was the duty of a muslim woman to cover her head and that they should be allowed to wear them wherever and whenever they choose - an opinion not shared by the vast majority of germans . not a political statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz sees the headscarf as a sign of separation and unwillingness to integrate according to the deputy secretary general of the konrad adenauer foundation , christoph kannengiesser , the wearing of a headscarf is not necessarily a political statement and it should not stop the communication between muslims and germans . " we must not allow muslim women to separate themselves from german society , " kannengiesser said .
" we have to work harder to integrate them and the women also have to be willing to integrate .
muslims , however , are part of german society and we have to accept it if muslim girls and women choose to wear the headscarf . " the headscarf debate remains a political hot potato .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has repeatedly called on moslems to accept different opinions on the role of women and the wearing of headscarves . a few months ago , ekin deligöz , an ethnic turk and member of the green party in the german parliament , was placed under police protection after receiving death threats because she called on moslem women to take off their headscarves .

" he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .
" sarkozy , the quintessential macho , is usually quick and without scruples bordering brutality when he 's trying to hit an opponent .
his ability to punch has worked well in a political world dominated by men .
it wo n't be of much use against madame royal . " der tagesspiegel in berlin opined that it was time for president jacques chirac to rally behind his party colleague : " sarkozy 's nomination is a last defeat for chirac , who has done everything to prevent this .
but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .
both have remained political outsiders , who will have to fight against the establishment . "
" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .
ms royal also offers france and europe a break from the political past .
but her socially inclusive and pragmatic approach offers her country and our continent a much more constructive and trustworthy way forward than mr sarkozy 's . "
the times of london saw things differently .
" it is now official : in their next presidential election , french voters will face a choice between mr sarkozy 's pugnacious style and - he promises - uncompromising reforms , and the sweeping , sentimental generalities of segolene royal , the first woman to run for the elysee palace .
it is , in essence , a choice between a long-delayed and sorely-needed dose of gallic thatcherism , and a romantic reaffirmation of the socialist consensus that has cosseted the french public sector for so long that even france 's long-suffering taxpayers can no longer afford it .
both options are revolutionary , but the latter is revolutionary only because ms royal is a woman .
indeed , she has said that a win for her campaign would be a ' revolutionary gesture , ' and 40 per cent of voters have apparently opined in polls that her principal strength is her gender ... mr sarkozy , meanwhile , is walking a political tightrope .
he will need the votes of many on the right who backed jean marie le pen and the national front in 2002 , and he has already signalled that he favours a robust immigration policy .
but he can not afford to lose the entire immigrant vote in the process , and has floated positive discrimination schemes in a bid to broaden his appeal .
they would have helped his immigrant father , and if they help him to become president , that would help france . "
and in paris , liberation commented : " yes , this man is dangerous , especially for the left .
he is not the caesar nor the napolean that one sometimes sees in him .
elected in a referendum by a large majority of his camp , interior minister sarkozy is his own master and steers the ship of modern conservatism .
energy , talent and organization have helped him to this triumph .
he 's got a tight grip on things and that 's worrying .
the danger is now well-known .
a champ , who rules the media as much as himself , the state , his speech and a horrifying machinery .

dw 's ute schaeffer says germany and europe urgently need to rethink their policy towards africa . ghana - the country that german president horst köhler just visited for four days - is for african standards a model state .
the country 's progress , however , is still governed by foreign factors , both old and new .
traditionally , african development has been influenced by donor nations in europe and the usa .
more recently , the emerging economies of india and china have become factors of influence as well .
chinese investments in ghana , for instance , have long exceeded those of great britain .
china is pushing its way into the west african state with all its might . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer globalization and rapid growth of the emerging economies have outrun the classical , european type of development policy .
africa is now part of a new international architecture . ghanaians living abroad transfer up to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to their homeland every year , making a significant contribution to its economic growth .
in ghana , like in other parts of africa , doors remain wide open for china and india . europe has so far missed on this development and that 's what the german president is concerned about .
the old development recipes are no longer effective .
europe 's outdated africa policy , in which everybody takes care of their own , personal africa , should be dead and buried .
how long does europe think it can keep its markets protected from african products ?
how long can europe keep believing that it can prevent migration from the neighboring continent using high walls , border controls or reception camps in the north african desert ? the european policy toward africa , which is shaped by fear and protectionism , is limiting africa 's potential that others have long noticed and taken advantage of .
europe should become more aware of its own interests in africa , including , for example , the issue of energy .
at the moment , africa produces 12 percent of the world 's crude oil supplies .
by 2010 , that amount will double .
the continent has over 50 million tons of natural gas at its disposal , which is one third of the deposits in the world . africa 's unused potentials include its manpower .
europe needs immigrants as well temporary foreign workers .
migrations - from africa and elsewhere - must be legalized and africans , too , must be allowed temporary entry to europe .
not the least because africa is a growing market that countries like china and india have long noticed and started exploiting .
africa is developing quickly .
ghana is a case in point . europe should not hand its neighbor continent over to china .
it is important to establish wide-ranging connections , social contacts and networks to get to know each other so that everybody can recognize their common interest .
the german president knows this , which is why he has launched his africa initiative .
with his continuing engagement and his third trip to africa , he wants to make sure that africa remains on the german government 's agenda . germany could set certain things in motion for africa , both in the eu and at the g8 summit .
this could happen in theory at least , since other topics - the constitutional process or relations to central asia - are seen as the more urgent priorities of the german eu presidency .
the german government , however , is planning to address the issues of african economic conditions and development at the g8 level .
is that the first sign that the old europe is waking up and beginning to see its own chances in africa ?

" i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview on german radio on sunday . the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of germany 's nuclear power plants would be shut down by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says she wants realistic but environmentally safe alternatives to nuclear energy merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- signed on the nuclear phase-out plan when they formed a grand coalition government with spd after the 2005 elections - said , however , that german nuclear power plants could not be replaced by coal-powered plants because of carbon dioxide emissions and concerns about their contributing to global warming . according to merkel , climate change is one of the greatest challenges that humanity is facing today . sticking to the plan even though members of merkel 's own party have repeatedly asked for the government to reconsider the nuclear phase-out - especially in view of germany 's reliance on russian gas supplies - merkel said she was not planning on backing out of the coalition agreement , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions " at least for this legislative period , there will be no changes , " merkel said , referring to the phase-out .
" but we need to be realistic and look into how much can be achieved in how long . " six billion tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- a year pour into the atmosphere worldwide from sources such as power stations , chemical plants and steel foundries .
co2 contributes to global warming by trapping the sun ’ s rays in the atmosphere . merkel 's coalition partners from the spd remain strongly opposed to any changes to the phase-out plan . " the nuclear phase-out is possible along with a tightening of climate protection , " said ulrich kelber , deputy president of the spd parliamentary bloc . germany itself is divided over nuclear issues .
according to a forsa poll published on sunday , one half of germans are either in favor of prolonging the life of the country 's nuclear power plants or abandoning the nuclear phase-out altogether .
the other half would like to stick to the plan to shut the nuclear plants down . last week , the eu unveiled sweeping plans to diversify energy sources , limit greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and increase the use of renewable energy sources . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's criticism of russia over energy marks shift in ties chancellor angela merkel 's rebuke of russia over it halting oil supplies to europe has revealed a possible shift in ties between the two countries .

ferrero-waldner spoke to dw-radio about the upcoming visit and the state of relations between the eu and china . dw : how would you sum up the current state of relations between the eu and china ? ferrero-waldner : i would say that relations are very comprehensive and very important but we also see that in our trade cooperation agreement that we have from 1985 , these strategic partnerships that we have today with china , this old agreement is no longer up to the job .
this is the reason why during this trip my main purpose is to launch negotiations for the new partnership and cooperation agreement that will be much more comprehensive and which will build on this changing relationship that we have . in real terms , what do you hope to achieve ? in real terms , i think it will be necessary to really agree on providing a comprehensive framework for the 22 sectors in which the eu and china are already holding dialogues , including energy , the environment , agriculture , transport , education , science and technology but also key issues such as sustainable development , migration and of course the international challenges we both face such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction . on the topic of energy , china is a major global polluter .
is there an implicit message from the eu which is " you must change what you are doing " ? we already have a partnership on climate change with china since september 2005 as well as various action plans and memorandums of understanding where we touch upon clean coal , energy efficiency and renewable energies in general .
but we think china is so big that whatever we do in reducing emissions could be offset by china .
therefore we think it is highly important that china take on our technologies .
for instance , clean coal technology with carbon capture because china is currently bringing one coal fired power plant online every week .
you can imagine what that means .
therefore we want to get china closely working together with us and we 're taking the lead here . what 's in this for china ? i think china itself realizes more and more , and is interested in having a development in their industry that in the end does not jeopardize the environment .
that is also in their interest . peter dobbie interviewed benita ferrero-waldner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu trade commissioner has harsh words for beijing on a visit to china , the eu 's trade commissioner has n't been mincing words .

" he said the plan would allow investigators from an eu nation for the first time to have access to a dna or fingerprint databank of crime suspects in all other eu member states .
the only prerequisite , schäuble said , would be that a formal investigation would first have to be opened . widening existing treaty schäuble 's plan is n't entirely new .
it touches upon an existing agreement called the " prüm treaty " on police cooperation which seven states have already signed . named after the western german town where it was signed in 2005 , it allows participating nations mutual and automatic access to dna and fingerprint records , as well as car registration information .
the treaty allows police to pursue fugitives across another eu state 's border in case of imminent danger to individuals .
it also allows joint police patrols . but the treaty is only operational in germany , austria and spain . " our aim is to create a modern police information network for more effective crime control throughout europe , " schäuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan will lead to more cross-border cooperation in the eu schäuble also pointed out that in the six weeks that the prüm system has been in operation , the sharing of information between germany and austria has led to 1,500 dna matches , including 32 in homicide cases and 23 in rape or sexual assault cases . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the treaty would achieve two seemingly contradictory goals - making sensitive data available to security authorities while protecting the privacy rights of eu citizens . schäuble added that the information database would be used by police forces , not national intelligence agencies . not everyone in favor the german minister said monday that most eu member states had backed the idea of enshrining the prüm treaty in eu law . " we have had a very broad consensus .
i am pleasantly surprised , " schäuble said . " dna is today the most effective means of solving crime , " said french regional development minister christian estrosi , who represented french interior minister nicolas sarkozy at the talks .
on an eu-wide level " we could solve thousands of crimes much more quickly , " he added . however eu members britain , czech republic , ireland and poland said they needed more time to think about the treaty for fear that it might be too expensive to update their existing databanks . all states need to agree for the treaty to become eu law .
the european commission will put forward a formal proposal next month . schäuble 's proposal was criticized monday by germany 's opposition free-market liberals , the fdp .
the debate among eu ministers in dresden showed " the low premium that is put on civil rights and data security in eu legal and interior policy , " said gisela piltz , fdp spokeswoman on security affairs . more cooperation with us ? schäuble also said he could n't rule out opening germany 's police databank containing dna and digital fingerprint information to the us . the minister , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said the issue was first raised by representatives of the us department of the interior in september last year in order to help in the hunt for terrorism suspects who could be hiding in germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany launches eu initiative to tackle right-wing extremism germany has put forward measures to help europe unite forces in the battle against the far-right .

ferrero-waldner spoke to dw-radio about the upcoming visit and the state of relations between the eu and china . dw : how would you sum up the current state of relations between the eu and china ? ferrero-waldner : i would say that relations are very comprehensive and very important but we also see that in our trade cooperation agreement that we have from 1985 , these strategic partnerships that we have today with china , this old agreement is no longer up to the job .
this is the reason why during this trip my main purpose is to launch negotiations for the new partnership and cooperation agreement that will be much more comprehensive and which will build on this changing relationship that we have . in real terms , what do you hope to achieve ? in real terms , i think it will be necessary to really agree on providing a comprehensive framework for the 22 sectors in which the eu and china are already holding dialogues , including energy , the environment , agriculture , transport , education , science and technology but also key issues such as sustainable development , migration and of course the international challenges we both face such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction . on the topic of energy , china is a major global polluter .
is there an implicit message from the eu which is " you must change what you are doing " ? we already have a partnership on climate change with china since september 2005 as well as various action plans and memorandums of understanding where we touch upon clean coal , energy efficiency and renewable energies in general .
but we think china is so big that whatever we do in reducing emissions could be offset by china .
therefore we think it is highly important that china take on our technologies .
for instance , clean coal technology with carbon capture because china is currently bringing one coal fired power plant online every week .
you can imagine what that means .
therefore we want to get china closely working together with us and we 're taking the lead here . what 's in this for china ? i think china itself realizes more and more , and is interested in having a development in their industry that in the end does not jeopardize the environment .
that is also in their interest . peter dobbie interviewed benita ferrero-waldner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu trade commissioner has harsh words for beijing on a visit to china , the eu 's trade commissioner has n't been mincing words .

-lrb- 07.11.2006 -rrb- eu calls on china to open markets the european union said tuesday accusing china of not doing enough to encourage free trade , saying trade needed to be a " two-way street " and warning of a possible backlash if trade is n't opened .

" he said the plan would allow investigators from an eu nation for the first time to have access to a dna or fingerprint databank of crime suspects in all other eu member states .
the only prerequisite , schäuble said , would be that a formal investigation would first have to be opened . widening existing treaty schäuble 's plan is n't entirely new .
it touches upon an existing agreement called the " prüm treaty " on police cooperation which seven states have already signed . named after the western german town where it was signed in 2005 , it allows participating nations mutual and automatic access to dna and fingerprint records , as well as car registration information .
the treaty allows police to pursue fugitives across another eu state 's border in case of imminent danger to individuals .
it also allows joint police patrols . but the treaty is only operational in germany , austria and spain . " our aim is to create a modern police information network for more effective crime control throughout europe , " schäuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan will lead to more cross-border cooperation in the eu schäuble also pointed out that in the six weeks that the prüm system has been in operation , the sharing of information between germany and austria has led to 1,500 dna matches , including 32 in homicide cases and 23 in rape or sexual assault cases . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the treaty would achieve two seemingly contradictory goals - making sensitive data available to security authorities while protecting the privacy rights of eu citizens . schäuble added that the information database would be used by police forces , not national intelligence agencies . not everyone in favor the german minister said monday that most eu member states had backed the idea of enshrining the prüm treaty in eu law . " we have had a very broad consensus .
i am pleasantly surprised , " schäuble said . " dna is today the most effective means of solving crime , " said french regional development minister christian estrosi , who represented french interior minister nicolas sarkozy at the talks .
on an eu-wide level " we could solve thousands of crimes much more quickly , " he added . however eu members britain , czech republic , ireland and poland said they needed more time to think about the treaty for fear that it might be too expensive to update their existing databanks . all states need to agree for the treaty to become eu law .
the european commission will put forward a formal proposal next month . schäuble 's proposal was criticized monday by germany 's opposition free-market liberals , the fdp .
the debate among eu ministers in dresden showed " the low premium that is put on civil rights and data security in eu legal and interior policy , " said gisela piltz , fdp spokeswoman on security affairs . more cooperation with us ? schäuble also said he could n't rule out opening germany 's police databank containing dna and digital fingerprint information to the us . the minister , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said the issue was first raised by representatives of the us department of the interior in september last year in order to help in the hunt for terrorism suspects who could be hiding in germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany launches eu initiative to tackle right-wing extremism germany has put forward measures to help europe unite forces in the battle against the far-right .

" in the context of school supervision , the lawmaker can decide on rules regarding the extent to which teachers are banned from wearing external symbols and pieces of clothing that express a religious or ideological conviction while teaching , " said judge karl huber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike in france , german students are allowed to wear headscarves an islamic religious group , which brought the case to the court , claimed that the bavarian headscarf ban - which was adopted in november 2004 - was unconstitutional because it did not treat all religions as equal , outlawing only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols . the state government , on the other hand , argued that the hijab - a headscarf which is meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family - was clashing with gender equality , which is guaranteed by the constitution . this latest legal wrangle over headscarves highlights the inconsistency of bavaria 's state 's school law .

eight german states , including berlin , have so far passed school laws that ban headscarves . unlike other headscarf-banning states , which saw the muslim attire as an affront to christian values , berlin decided to treat all religious symbols on an equal basis . " berlin is the only city and german state which has not only banned the headscarf , but all religious symbols in schools - that is the big difference , " said günther piening , who is the berlin commissioner for integration and migration . " i think that 's the only way to do it , because the general ban does not discriminate against one religion , " he added .
" it abides by the principle of equality as laid down in the german constitution . " women 's rights groups and conservative politicians , however , argue that many moslem women have no choice but to wear a headscarf because their families demand it .
yet , according to a recent survey conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , 97 percent of those women asked said it was the duty of a muslim woman to cover her head and that they should be allowed to wear them wherever and whenever they choose - an opinion not shared by the vast majority of germans . not a political statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz sees the headscarf as a sign of separation and unwillingness to integrate according to the deputy secretary general of the konrad adenauer foundation , christoph kannengiesser , the wearing of a headscarf is not necessarily a political statement and it should not stop the communication between muslims and germans . " we must not allow muslim women to separate themselves from german society , " kannengiesser said .
" we have to work harder to integrate them and the women also have to be willing to integrate .
muslims , however , are part of german society and we have to accept it if muslim girls and women choose to wear the headscarf . " the headscarf debate remains a political hot potato .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has repeatedly called on moslems to accept different opinions on the role of women and the wearing of headscarves . a few months ago , ekin deligöz , an ethnic turk and member of the green party in the german parliament , was placed under police protection after receiving death threats because she called on moslem women to take off their headscarves .

german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has repeatedly called on moslems to accept different opinions on the role of women and the wearing of headscarves . a few months ago , ekin deligöz , an ethnic turk and member of the green party in the german parliament , was placed under police protection after receiving death threats because she called on moslem women to take off their headscarves .

india 's automobile sector is currently growing at an estimated 17 percent a year . add that to an annual growth rate of almost 10 percent and it 's not difficult to see why the german car industry - which has thus far focused largely on china - is increasingly training its sights on india . daimlerchrysler , vw lead the way earlier this month , daimlerchrysler ag , the world 's second-largest luxury carmaker , said it was investing 44 million euros -lrb- $ 57 million -rrb- to build a new assembly plant in the western indian state of maharashtra .
the state is already home to factories of tata , renault and fiat spa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercedes s-class symbolizes top quality in india by 2009 , the stuttgart-based german-american carmaker - which currently assembles the e-class , c-class and s-class models in india - plans to roll out a further 5,000 luxury models a year . wolfsburg-based volkswagen last year signed a whopping deal worth 410 million euros - the single-biggest foreign investment in indian so far - with the government of maharashtra to set up a production facility on the outskirts of the rapidly growing city of pune .
the plant will manufacture the passat and other models . volkswagen 's affiliate audi ag will also begin work on producing the a6 sedan in india this year . mercedes as a status symbol " the indian car market has huge growth potential , " said thomas becker , deputy head of the german car industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- .
he pointed out that german carmakers in india saw growth rates of over 33 percent in 2006 , double the rate of the indian market as a whole . though german carmakers only have a market share of around one percent in india , becker stressed that it was changing fast given that they had a solid presence in the luxury car segment .
" it 's really important that you 're up there in the high-value segment nice and early , " he added . dilip chenoy , head of the society of indian automobile manufacturers -lrb- siam -rrb- said german carmakers are prized for their luxury cars and diesel technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign cars are a status symbol for india 's well-heeled " german cars are valued for their quality and sturdiness , " chenoy said , adding that most of them boasted sophisticated technology , a smooth drive and sleek looks and contrasted greatly with the traditional image of lumbering diesel-powered cars . chenoy added that german luxury cars had also become something of a status symbol among india 's upwardly mobile and wealthy classes . daimlerchrysler - with more than 80 percent of the market share - is the unmistakable leader in the luxury segment . " the cars are a ' statement ' and they 're the vehicle of choice for many managers , " chenoy said .
" the main buyers are big companies , " said chenoy , adding that the mercedes is usually bought by an increasingly affluent new class of entrepreneurs in northern india . problems remain despite india 's robustly growing economy and surging consumer confidence , the country 's road network , hampered by potholes and heavy congestion , still needs to be expanded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's terrible roads remain a huge barrier to foreign investment german carmakers say that strengthens the case for setting up their own production plants in india , also arguing that in light of high indian import tariffs , it makes sense to ship auto parts from germany and assemble the cars in india . " this process is usually preferred as a first step towards setting up your own production in many emerging markets , " becker said , adding that the operation in no way undermined the performance of the car or damaged germany 's high reputation for quality products . german carmakers say that one way to lower high import tariffs and dismantle other barriers to investment in india would be to set up a free-trade zone between the eu and india next year .
that would also make it easier for india to export cars and auto components to europe . ana lehmann -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automobile market ends 2006 with a bang the german car industry zoomed to record levels of exports and production last year .

illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .
he 's hoping to convince his counterparts that a central eu data base on crime is urgently needed . fighting crime and reforming laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries is in the mood for reforms meanwhile , german justice minister brigitte zypries , for her part , wants to promote tougher legislation against racially motivated crimes , including the denial of the holocaust .
a german proposal seeks to criminalize all racist declarations that incite violence against a single person or specific group of people . but the german justice minister also called for harmonization of a wide range of other legal issues .
she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .
in addition , there are about one million divorces in the eu each year , and 20 percent of them involve people from two different european nations .
so , there 's a dire need to have clearer legislation as to how to deal with such transnational cases in the bloc . " the dresden meeting of eu interior and justice ministers is an informal one , so no immediate policy changes are expected .
it is hoped though that many of the proposals made in dresden will be turned into law later this year . hardy graupner / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , african officials discuss immigration ministers from more than 50 eu and african countries are expected to conclude a conference in the libyan capital tripoli on migration flows and development with a joint declaration on migration issues .

" he said the plan would allow investigators from an eu nation for the first time to have access to a dna or fingerprint databank of crime suspects in all other eu member states .
the only prerequisite , schäuble said , would be that a formal investigation would first have to be opened . widening existing treaty schäuble 's plan is n't entirely new .
it touches upon an existing agreement called the " prüm treaty " on police cooperation which seven states have already signed . named after the western german town where it was signed in 2005 , it allows participating nations mutual and automatic access to dna and fingerprint records , as well as car registration information .
the treaty allows police to pursue fugitives across another eu state 's border in case of imminent danger to individuals .
it also allows joint police patrols . but the treaty is only operational in germany , austria and spain . " our aim is to create a modern police information network for more effective crime control throughout europe , " schäuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan will lead to more cross-border cooperation in the eu schäuble also pointed out that in the six weeks that the prüm system has been in operation , the sharing of information between germany and austria has led to 1,500 dna matches , including 32 in homicide cases and 23 in rape or sexual assault cases . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the treaty would achieve two seemingly contradictory goals - making sensitive data available to security authorities while protecting the privacy rights of eu citizens . schäuble added that the information database would be used by police forces , not national intelligence agencies . not everyone in favor the german minister said monday that most eu member states had backed the idea of enshrining the prüm treaty in eu law . " we have had a very broad consensus .
i am pleasantly surprised , " schäuble said . " dna is today the most effective means of solving crime , " said french regional development minister christian estrosi , who represented french interior minister nicolas sarkozy at the talks .
on an eu-wide level " we could solve thousands of crimes much more quickly , " he added . however eu members britain , czech republic , ireland and poland said they needed more time to think about the treaty for fear that it might be too expensive to update their existing databanks . all states need to agree for the treaty to become eu law .
the european commission will put forward a formal proposal next month . schäuble 's proposal was criticized monday by germany 's opposition free-market liberals , the fdp .
the debate among eu ministers in dresden showed " the low premium that is put on civil rights and data security in eu legal and interior policy , " said gisela piltz , fdp spokeswoman on security affairs . more cooperation with us ? schäuble also said he could n't rule out opening germany 's police databank containing dna and digital fingerprint information to the us . the minister , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said the issue was first raised by representatives of the us department of the interior in september last year in order to help in the hunt for terrorism suspects who could be hiding in germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany launches eu initiative to tackle right-wing extremism germany has put forward measures to help europe unite forces in the battle against the far-right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 15.01.2007 minister pushes for eu-wide dna data sharing to fight crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal could ease the apprehension of suspects across eu borders , advocates say german interior minister schäuble wants eu member states to share dna and digital fingerprint data in future to make it easier to catch criminals and fight terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said monday that the proposal would speed up cross-border cooperation and information-sharing among police in the 27-member eu and help crack down on crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says the plan will improve information-sharing speaking at an informal meeting of eu counterparts in the city of dresden , the first of its kind since germany took over the six-month eu presidency , schäuble said a europe-wide networking of dna databanks would offer " a huge sea of possibilities to recognize and prevent crime . " he said the plan would allow investigators from an eu nation for the first time to have access to a dna or fingerprint databank of crime suspects in all other eu member states .
the only prerequisite , schäuble said , would be that a formal investigation would first have to be opened . widening existing treaty schäuble 's plan is n't entirely new .
it touches upon an existing agreement called the " prüm treaty " on police cooperation which seven states have already signed . named after the western german town where it was signed in 2005 , it allows participating nations mutual and automatic access to dna and fingerprint records , as well as car registration information .
the treaty allows police to pursue fugitives across another eu state 's border in case of imminent danger to individuals .
it also allows joint police patrols . but the treaty is only operational in germany , austria and spain . " our aim is to create a modern police information network for more effective crime control throughout europe , " schäuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan will lead to more cross-border cooperation in the eu schäuble also pointed out that in the six weeks that the prüm system has been in operation , the sharing of information between germany and austria has led to 1,500 dna matches , including 32 in homicide cases and 23 in rape or sexual assault cases . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the treaty would achieve two seemingly contradictory goals - making sensitive data available to security authorities while protecting the privacy rights of eu citizens . schäuble added that the information database would be used by police forces , not national intelligence agencies . not everyone in favor the german minister said monday that most eu member states had backed the idea of enshrining the prüm treaty in eu law . " we have had a very broad consensus .
i am pleasantly surprised , " schäuble said . " dna is today the most effective means of solving crime , " said french regional development minister christian estrosi , who represented french interior minister nicolas sarkozy at the talks .
on an eu-wide level " we could solve thousands of crimes much more quickly , " he added . however eu members britain , czech republic , ireland and poland said they needed more time to think about the treaty for fear that it might be too expensive to update their existing databanks . all states need to agree for the treaty to become eu law .
the european commission will put forward a formal proposal next month . schäuble 's proposal was criticized monday by germany 's opposition free-market liberals , the fdp .
the debate among eu ministers in dresden showed " the low premium that is put on civil rights and data security in eu legal and interior policy , " said gisela piltz , fdp spokeswoman on security affairs . more cooperation with us ? schäuble also said he could n't rule out opening germany 's police databank containing dna and digital fingerprint information to the us . the minister , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said the issue was first raised by representatives of the us department of the interior in september last year in order to help in the hunt for terrorism suspects who could be hiding in germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany launches eu initiative to tackle right-wing extremism germany has put forward measures to help europe unite forces in the battle against the far-right .

dw 's ute schaeffer says germany and europe urgently need to rethink their policy towards africa . ghana - the country that german president horst köhler just visited for four days - is for african standards a model state .
the country 's progress , however , is still governed by foreign factors , both old and new .
traditionally , african development has been influenced by donor nations in europe and the usa .
more recently , the emerging economies of india and china have become factors of influence as well .
chinese investments in ghana , for instance , have long exceeded those of great britain .
china is pushing its way into the west african state with all its might . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer globalization and rapid growth of the emerging economies have outrun the classical , european type of development policy .
africa is now part of a new international architecture . ghanaians living abroad transfer up to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to their homeland every year , making a significant contribution to its economic growth .
in ghana , like in other parts of africa , doors remain wide open for china and india . europe has so far missed on this development and that 's what the german president is concerned about .
the old development recipes are no longer effective .
europe 's outdated africa policy , in which everybody takes care of their own , personal africa , should be dead and buried .
how long does europe think it can keep its markets protected from african products ?
how long can europe keep believing that it can prevent migration from the neighboring continent using high walls , border controls or reception camps in the north african desert ? the european policy toward africa , which is shaped by fear and protectionism , is limiting africa 's potential that others have long noticed and taken advantage of .
europe should become more aware of its own interests in africa , including , for example , the issue of energy .
at the moment , africa produces 12 percent of the world 's crude oil supplies .
by 2010 , that amount will double .
the continent has over 50 million tons of natural gas at its disposal , which is one third of the deposits in the world . africa 's unused potentials include its manpower .
europe needs immigrants as well temporary foreign workers .
migrations - from africa and elsewhere - must be legalized and africans , too , must be allowed temporary entry to europe .
not the least because africa is a growing market that countries like china and india have long noticed and started exploiting .
africa is developing quickly .
ghana is a case in point . europe should not hand its neighbor continent over to china .
it is important to establish wide-ranging connections , social contacts and networks to get to know each other so that everybody can recognize their common interest .
the german president knows this , which is why he has launched his africa initiative .
with his continuing engagement and his third trip to africa , he wants to make sure that africa remains on the german government 's agenda . germany could set certain things in motion for africa , both in the eu and at the g8 summit .
this could happen in theory at least , since other topics - the constitutional process or relations to central asia - are seen as the more urgent priorities of the german eu presidency .
the german government , however , is planning to address the issues of african economic conditions and development at the g8 level .
is that the first sign that the old europe is waking up and beginning to see its own chances in africa ?

illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .
he 's hoping to convince his counterparts that a central eu data base on crime is urgently needed . fighting crime and reforming laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries is in the mood for reforms meanwhile , german justice minister brigitte zypries , for her part , wants to promote tougher legislation against racially motivated crimes , including the denial of the holocaust .
a german proposal seeks to criminalize all racist declarations that incite violence against a single person or specific group of people . but the german justice minister also called for harmonization of a wide range of other legal issues .
she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .
in addition , there are about one million divorces in the eu each year , and 20 percent of them involve people from two different european nations .
so , there 's a dire need to have clearer legislation as to how to deal with such transnational cases in the bloc . " the dresden meeting of eu interior and justice ministers is an informal one , so no immediate policy changes are expected .
it is hoped though that many of the proposals made in dresden will be turned into law later this year . hardy graupner / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , african officials discuss immigration ministers from more than 50 eu and african countries are expected to conclude a conference in the libyan capital tripoli on migration flows and development with a joint declaration on migration issues .

the concept , dubbed sightsleeping -lrb- sightseeing plus sleeping -rrb- , runs parallel to the national german center for tourism focus on art and culture in 2007 . jury selected first hotels a seven-member jury of art , design and tourism experts selected the first 12 official sightsleeping hotels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nebelhorn relaxhotel is one of the hotels with a more contemporary atmosphere only castles , manors , other land-marked buildings and houses with contemporary furnishings were taken into consideration .
to be considered a sightsleeping hotel , they had to offer visually appealing decor , which could include paintings , prints , drawings or sculptures . in addition , the guest houses should offer extra events , like author readings , concerts or theatrical performances . from renaissance to avant-garde at schloss eggersberg in altmühltal , for example , guests can order a brass ensemble to play folk music , or even organize their own piano recital on a blüthner grand piano from 1894 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lobby in munich 's hotel advokat for something slightly more modern , visitors to the 1960s retro-chic hotel advokat in downtown munich can relax , work , sleep or dine among avant-garde works of art . " evaluating the authenticity of the locations was particularly important to me , " said jury member michael pause , editor-in-chief of the leisure programs broadcast by the bavarian public television .

" i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview on german radio on sunday . the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of germany 's nuclear power plants would be shut down by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says she wants realistic but environmentally safe alternatives to nuclear energy merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- signed on the nuclear phase-out plan when they formed a grand coalition government with spd after the 2005 elections - said , however , that german nuclear power plants could not be replaced by coal-powered plants because of carbon dioxide emissions and concerns about their contributing to global warming . according to merkel , climate change is one of the greatest challenges that humanity is facing today . sticking to the plan even though members of merkel 's own party have repeatedly asked for the government to reconsider the nuclear phase-out - especially in view of germany 's reliance on russian gas supplies - merkel said she was not planning on backing out of the coalition agreement , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions " at least for this legislative period , there will be no changes , " merkel said , referring to the phase-out .
" but we need to be realistic and look into how much can be achieved in how long . " six billion tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- a year pour into the atmosphere worldwide from sources such as power stations , chemical plants and steel foundries .
co2 contributes to global warming by trapping the sun ’ s rays in the atmosphere . merkel 's coalition partners from the spd remain strongly opposed to any changes to the phase-out plan . " the nuclear phase-out is possible along with a tightening of climate protection , " said ulrich kelber , deputy president of the spd parliamentary bloc . germany itself is divided over nuclear issues .
according to a forsa poll published on sunday , one half of germans are either in favor of prolonging the life of the country 's nuclear power plants or abandoning the nuclear phase-out altogether .
the other half would like to stick to the plan to shut the nuclear plants down . last week , the eu unveiled sweeping plans to diversify energy sources , limit greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and increase the use of renewable energy sources . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's criticism of russia over energy marks shift in ties chancellor angela merkel 's rebuke of russia over it halting oil supplies to europe has revealed a possible shift in ties between the two countries .

india 's automobile sector is currently growing at an estimated 17 percent a year . add that to an annual growth rate of almost 10 percent and it 's not difficult to see why the german car industry - which has thus far focused largely on china - is increasingly training its sights on india . daimlerchrysler , vw lead the way earlier this month , daimlerchrysler ag , the world 's second-largest luxury carmaker , said it was investing 44 million euros -lrb- $ 57 million -rrb- to build a new assembly plant in the western indian state of maharashtra .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 15.01.2007 illegal migration high on new eu presidency 's agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many more illegal migrants from africa will risk the hazardous journey to europe this spring with germany now president of the european union , the city of dresden hosts the first informal meeting of eu interior and justice ministers of the new presidency monday .
illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .
he 's hoping to convince his counterparts that a central eu data base on crime is urgently needed . fighting crime and reforming laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries is in the mood for reforms meanwhile , german justice minister brigitte zypries , for her part , wants to promote tougher legislation against racially motivated crimes , including the denial of the holocaust .
a german proposal seeks to criminalize all racist declarations that incite violence against a single person or specific group of people . but the german justice minister also called for harmonization of a wide range of other legal issues .
she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .
in addition , there are about one million divorces in the eu each year , and 20 percent of them involve people from two different european nations .
so , there 's a dire need to have clearer legislation as to how to deal with such transnational cases in the bloc . " the dresden meeting of eu interior and justice ministers is an informal one , so no immediate policy changes are expected .
it is hoped though that many of the proposals made in dresden will be turned into law later this year . hardy graupner / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , african officials discuss immigration ministers from more than 50 eu and african countries are expected to conclude a conference in the libyan capital tripoli on migration flows and development with a joint declaration on migration issues .
-lrb- 23.11.2006 -rrb- berlin and paris suggest new model for eu migration french and german interior ministers have proposed a new eu migration policy from the european union 's six largest countries .
the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time .
-lrb- 27.10.2006 -rrb- eu pledges aid to spain on african migrant problem the european union has offered to help spain deal with a wave of illegal immigrants abandoning africa for the canary islands .
the aid will include setting up naval and air patrols .

ferrero-waldner spoke to dw-radio about the upcoming visit and the state of relations between the eu and china . dw : how would you sum up the current state of relations between the eu and china ? ferrero-waldner : i would say that relations are very comprehensive and very important but we also see that in our trade cooperation agreement that we have from 1985 , these strategic partnerships that we have today with china , this old agreement is no longer up to the job .
this is the reason why during this trip my main purpose is to launch negotiations for the new partnership and cooperation agreement that will be much more comprehensive and which will build on this changing relationship that we have . in real terms , what do you hope to achieve ? in real terms , i think it will be necessary to really agree on providing a comprehensive framework for the 22 sectors in which the eu and china are already holding dialogues , including energy , the environment , agriculture , transport , education , science and technology but also key issues such as sustainable development , migration and of course the international challenges we both face such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction . on the topic of energy , china is a major global polluter .
is there an implicit message from the eu which is " you must change what you are doing " ? we already have a partnership on climate change with china since september 2005 as well as various action plans and memorandums of understanding where we touch upon clean coal , energy efficiency and renewable energies in general .
but we think china is so big that whatever we do in reducing emissions could be offset by china .
therefore we think it is highly important that china take on our technologies .
for instance , clean coal technology with carbon capture because china is currently bringing one coal fired power plant online every week .
you can imagine what that means .
therefore we want to get china closely working together with us and we 're taking the lead here . what 's in this for china ? i think china itself realizes more and more , and is interested in having a development in their industry that in the end does not jeopardize the environment .
that is also in their interest . peter dobbie interviewed benita ferrero-waldner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu trade commissioner has harsh words for beijing on a visit to china , the eu 's trade commissioner has n't been mincing words .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 15.01.2007 germany plans massive volunteer abroad program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will benefit most from the program ?
hoping to increase awareness for development issues , germany plans to introduce a new volunteer service for young people in 2008 .
most experts welcomed the idea in principle , but expressed concerns about logistics . when german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul recently announced her plan for a new voluntary service abroad program , she said she was simply reacting to an unmet demand . " every day , we are hearing from young people who want to do something , " the social democrat told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
" we want to respond to this desire to do something . " wieczorek-zeul 's response is aimed at people between the ages of 18 and 28 , who have a high school diploma or equivalent certificate and want to work in a developing country for three to 24 months . the ministry offers to pay 580 euros -lrb- $ 752 -rrb- per month to cover living costs .
in total , wieczorek-zeul plans to earmark 70 million euros for 10,000 participants .
the money will not come from existing programs , but new funds , according to a ministry spokesman . providing the means to volunteer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " we want teenagers , whose families do not have the means , to be able to volunteer abroad , " she told the paper , adding that existing volunteer programs often come with a hefty price tag . those working in the field generally welcomed the idea . " we think it 's a positive thing that the ministry is getting involved , " said jan gildemeister , the executive director of action committee service for peace -lrb- acsp -rrb- , an umbrella organization for christian groups that offer voluntary service programs abroad . " they want to increase awareness of development aid issues among young people and we welcome that , " he added .
" it 's the program itself that we 're concerned about . " protecting quality gildemeister said that it was important to work closely with non-governmental organizations in developing countries to make sure that they had the necessary resources to deal with volunteers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone who wants to volunteer abroad necessarily meets the requirements " you have to realize that volunteers need training and supervision , " gildemeister said , adding that it has taken acsp members years to establish ties with partner organizations abroad . carefully selecting candidates was another issue to consider , he said , counting a certain level of independence and language skills as essentials for people interested in volunteering in developing countries . " you ca n't send an 18-year-old to tanzania who 's lacking those skills , " he said , adding that he was looking forward to discussing these and other issues during a meeting with ministry officials on thursday . who benefits ? christof hartmann , a professor for development policy at the university of duisburg-essen , also questioned the usefulness of sending unskilled germans to developing countries as aid workers . " there are enough qualified people in these countries , " he said .
" if there 's a need for people , it 's for experts in selected areas , not someone who 'll help out at the hospital or can fill in excel spreadsheets . " hartmann added that young people in germany could certainly benefit from exposure to development issues . " but the question is whether we want to view this as part of our development aid policy , " he said . new experiences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experiencing the real thing helps broaden horizons ute koczy , the development aid spokeswoman for the opposition greens party in parliament , agreed that it was important to make sure that the organizations abroad found the program useful . " it can not be that only youngsters get something out of it , " she said .
" but generally speaking , it 's the volunteers who benefit most from these kinds of trips .
it 's good to give young people the opportunity to get a taste of the world , but they should n't expect to change it within the course of three months . " mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as state shrinks , can volunteers fill gaps ?
volunteerism in germany is not as strong as it is in the us .

" i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview on german radio on sunday . the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of germany 's nuclear power plants would be shut down by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says she wants realistic but environmentally safe alternatives to nuclear energy merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- signed on the nuclear phase-out plan when they formed a grand coalition government with spd after the 2005 elections - said , however , that german nuclear power plants could not be replaced by coal-powered plants because of carbon dioxide emissions and concerns about their contributing to global warming . according to merkel , climate change is one of the greatest challenges that humanity is facing today . sticking to the plan even though members of merkel 's own party have repeatedly asked for the government to reconsider the nuclear phase-out - especially in view of germany 's reliance on russian gas supplies - merkel said she was not planning on backing out of the coalition agreement , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions " at least for this legislative period , there will be no changes , " merkel said , referring to the phase-out .

according to a forsa poll published on sunday , one half of germans are either in favor of prolonging the life of the country 's nuclear power plants or abandoning the nuclear phase-out altogether .

" in the context of school supervision , the lawmaker can decide on rules regarding the extent to which teachers are banned from wearing external symbols and pieces of clothing that express a religious or ideological conviction while teaching , " said judge karl huber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike in france , german students are allowed to wear headscarves an islamic religious group , which brought the case to the court , claimed that the bavarian headscarf ban - which was adopted in november 2004 - was unconstitutional because it did not treat all religions as equal , outlawing only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols . the state government , on the other hand , argued that the hijab - a headscarf which is meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family - was clashing with gender equality , which is guaranteed by the constitution . this latest legal wrangle over headscarves highlights the inconsistency of bavaria 's state 's school law .
it says that no-one is allowed to wear religious symbols in the classroom - except christians and jews . all or none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is , among other things , about reconciling islam with western values the heated debate was first sparked in 2003 when germany 's federal constitutional court ruled that muslims could wear their headscarves while teaching but at the same time encouraged new laws to ban religious symbols .
eight german states , including berlin , have so far passed school laws that ban headscarves . unlike other headscarf-banning states , which saw the muslim attire as an affront to christian values , berlin decided to treat all religious symbols on an equal basis . " berlin is the only city and german state which has not only banned the headscarf , but all religious symbols in schools - that is the big difference , " said günther piening , who is the berlin commissioner for integration and migration . " i think that 's the only way to do it , because the general ban does not discriminate against one religion , " he added .
" it abides by the principle of equality as laid down in the german constitution . " women 's rights groups and conservative politicians , however , argue that many moslem women have no choice but to wear a headscarf because their families demand it .
yet , according to a recent survey conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , 97 percent of those women asked said it was the duty of a muslim woman to cover her head and that they should be allowed to wear them wherever and whenever they choose - an opinion not shared by the vast majority of germans . not a political statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz sees the headscarf as a sign of separation and unwillingness to integrate according to the deputy secretary general of the konrad adenauer foundation , christoph kannengiesser , the wearing of a headscarf is not necessarily a political statement and it should not stop the communication between muslims and germans . " we must not allow muslim women to separate themselves from german society , " kannengiesser said .
" we have to work harder to integrate them and the women also have to be willing to integrate .
muslims , however , are part of german society and we have to accept it if muslim girls and women choose to wear the headscarf . " the headscarf debate remains a political hot potato .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has repeatedly called on moslems to accept different opinions on the role of women and the wearing of headscarves . a few months ago , ekin deligöz , an ethnic turk and member of the green party in the german parliament , was placed under police protection after receiving death threats because she called on moslem women to take off their headscarves .
the affair triggered an outcry among the german population with many people wondering just how prepared muslims really are to integrate and also accept criticism . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hip-hop with a headscarf sahira is currently one of berlin 's most successful hip-hop artists .

" he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .
" sarkozy , the quintessential macho , is usually quick and without scruples bordering brutality when he 's trying to hit an opponent .
his ability to punch has worked well in a political world dominated by men .
it wo n't be of much use against madame royal . " der tagesspiegel in berlin opined that it was time for president jacques chirac to rally behind his party colleague : " sarkozy 's nomination is a last defeat for chirac , who has done everything to prevent this .
but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .
both have remained political outsiders , who will have to fight against the establishment . "
" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .
ms royal also offers france and europe a break from the political past .
but her socially inclusive and pragmatic approach offers her country and our continent a much more constructive and trustworthy way forward than mr sarkozy 's . "
the times of london saw things differently .
" it is now official : in their next presidential election , french voters will face a choice between mr sarkozy 's pugnacious style and - he promises - uncompromising reforms , and the sweeping , sentimental generalities of segolene royal , the first woman to run for the elysee palace .
it is , in essence , a choice between a long-delayed and sorely-needed dose of gallic thatcherism , and a romantic reaffirmation of the socialist consensus that has cosseted the french public sector for so long that even france 's long-suffering taxpayers can no longer afford it .
both options are revolutionary , but the latter is revolutionary only because ms royal is a woman .
indeed , she has said that a win for her campaign would be a ' revolutionary gesture , ' and 40 per cent of voters have apparently opined in polls that her principal strength is her gender ... mr sarkozy , meanwhile , is walking a political tightrope .
he will need the votes of many on the right who backed jean marie le pen and the national front in 2002 , and he has already signalled that he favours a robust immigration policy .
but he can not afford to lose the entire immigrant vote in the process , and has floated positive discrimination schemes in a bid to broaden his appeal .
they would have helped his immigrant father , and if they help him to become president , that would help france . "
and in paris , liberation commented : " yes , this man is dangerous , especially for the left .
he is not the caesar nor the napolean that one sometimes sees in him .
elected in a referendum by a large majority of his camp , interior minister sarkozy is his own master and steers the ship of modern conservatism .
energy , talent and organization have helped him to this triumph .
he 's got a tight grip on things and that 's worrying .
the danger is now well-known .
a champ , who rules the media as much as himself , the state , his speech and a horrifying machinery .

" i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview on german radio on sunday . the coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of germany 's nuclear power plants would be shut down by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says she wants realistic but environmentally safe alternatives to nuclear energy merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- signed on the nuclear phase-out plan when they formed a grand coalition government with spd after the 2005 elections - said , however , that german nuclear power plants could not be replaced by coal-powered plants because of carbon dioxide emissions and concerns about their contributing to global warming . according to merkel , climate change is one of the greatest challenges that humanity is facing today . sticking to the plan even though members of merkel 's own party have repeatedly asked for the government to reconsider the nuclear phase-out - especially in view of germany 's reliance on russian gas supplies - merkel said she was not planning on backing out of the coalition agreement , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions " at least for this legislative period , there will be no changes , " merkel said , referring to the phase-out .
" but we need to be realistic and look into how much can be achieved in how long . " six billion tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- a year pour into the atmosphere worldwide from sources such as power stations , chemical plants and steel foundries .
co2 contributes to global warming by trapping the sun ’ s rays in the atmosphere . merkel 's coalition partners from the spd remain strongly opposed to any changes to the phase-out plan . " the nuclear phase-out is possible along with a tightening of climate protection , " said ulrich kelber , deputy president of the spd parliamentary bloc . germany itself is divided over nuclear issues .
according to a forsa poll published on sunday , one half of germans are either in favor of prolonging the life of the country 's nuclear power plants or abandoning the nuclear phase-out altogether .
the other half would like to stick to the plan to shut the nuclear plants down . last week , the eu unveiled sweeping plans to diversify energy sources , limit greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and increase the use of renewable energy sources . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's criticism of russia over energy marks shift in ties chancellor angela merkel 's rebuke of russia over it halting oil supplies to europe has revealed a possible shift in ties between the two countries .
-lrb- 13.01.2007 -rrb- germany changes stance to support eu energy liberalization germany is no longer opposed to proposals by the european commission to liberalize the energy market and is open to separating energy producers from their distribution networks , the country 's economy minister said .

india 's automobile sector is currently growing at an estimated 17 percent a year . add that to an annual growth rate of almost 10 percent and it 's not difficult to see why the german car industry - which has thus far focused largely on china - is increasingly training its sights on india . daimlerchrysler , vw lead the way earlier this month , daimlerchrysler ag , the world 's second-largest luxury carmaker , said it was investing 44 million euros -lrb- $ 57 million -rrb- to build a new assembly plant in the western indian state of maharashtra .

" the cars are a ' statement ' and they 're the vehicle of choice for many managers , " chenoy said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 15.01.2007 germany plans massive volunteer abroad program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will benefit most from the program ?
hoping to increase awareness for development issues , germany plans to introduce a new volunteer service for young people in 2008 .
most experts welcomed the idea in principle , but expressed concerns about logistics . when german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul recently announced her plan for a new voluntary service abroad program , she said she was simply reacting to an unmet demand . " every day , we are hearing from young people who want to do something , " the social democrat told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
" we want to respond to this desire to do something . " wieczorek-zeul 's response is aimed at people between the ages of 18 and 28 , who have a high school diploma or equivalent certificate and want to work in a developing country for three to 24 months . the ministry offers to pay 580 euros -lrb- $ 752 -rrb- per month to cover living costs .
in total , wieczorek-zeul plans to earmark 70 million euros for 10,000 participants .
the money will not come from existing programs , but new funds , according to a ministry spokesman . providing the means to volunteer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " we want teenagers , whose families do not have the means , to be able to volunteer abroad , " she told the paper , adding that existing volunteer programs often come with a hefty price tag . those working in the field generally welcomed the idea . " we think it 's a positive thing that the ministry is getting involved , " said jan gildemeister , the executive director of action committee service for peace -lrb- acsp -rrb- , an umbrella organization for christian groups that offer voluntary service programs abroad . " they want to increase awareness of development aid issues among young people and we welcome that , " he added .

hoping to increase awareness for development issues , germany plans to introduce a new volunteer service for young people in 2008 .
most experts welcomed the idea in principle , but expressed concerns about logistics . when german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul recently announced her plan for a new voluntary service abroad program , she said she was simply reacting to an unmet demand . " every day , we are hearing from young people who want to do something , " the social democrat told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
" we want to respond to this desire to do something . " wieczorek-zeul 's response is aimed at people between the ages of 18 and 28 , who have a high school diploma or equivalent certificate and want to work in a developing country for three to 24 months . the ministry offers to pay 580 euros -lrb- $ 752 -rrb- per month to cover living costs .
in total , wieczorek-zeul plans to earmark 70 million euros for 10,000 participants .
the money will not come from existing programs , but new funds , according to a ministry spokesman . providing the means to volunteer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " we want teenagers , whose families do not have the means , to be able to volunteer abroad , " she told the paper , adding that existing volunteer programs often come with a hefty price tag . those working in the field generally welcomed the idea .

dw 's ute schaeffer says germany and europe urgently need to rethink their policy towards africa . ghana - the country that german president horst köhler just visited for four days - is for african standards a model state .
the country 's progress , however , is still governed by foreign factors , both old and new .
traditionally , african development has been influenced by donor nations in europe and the usa .
more recently , the emerging economies of india and china have become factors of influence as well .
chinese investments in ghana , for instance , have long exceeded those of great britain .
china is pushing its way into the west african state with all its might . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer globalization and rapid growth of the emerging economies have outrun the classical , european type of development policy .
africa is now part of a new international architecture . ghanaians living abroad transfer up to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to their homeland every year , making a significant contribution to its economic growth .
in ghana , like in other parts of africa , doors remain wide open for china and india . europe has so far missed on this development and that 's what the german president is concerned about .
the old development recipes are no longer effective .
europe 's outdated africa policy , in which everybody takes care of their own , personal africa , should be dead and buried .
how long does europe think it can keep its markets protected from african products ?
how long can europe keep believing that it can prevent migration from the neighboring continent using high walls , border controls or reception camps in the north african desert ? the european policy toward africa , which is shaped by fear and protectionism , is limiting africa 's potential that others have long noticed and taken advantage of .
europe should become more aware of its own interests in africa , including , for example , the issue of energy .
at the moment , africa produces 12 percent of the world 's crude oil supplies .
by 2010 , that amount will double .
the continent has over 50 million tons of natural gas at its disposal , which is one third of the deposits in the world . africa 's unused potentials include its manpower .
europe needs immigrants as well temporary foreign workers .
migrations - from africa and elsewhere - must be legalized and africans , too , must be allowed temporary entry to europe .
not the least because africa is a growing market that countries like china and india have long noticed and started exploiting .
africa is developing quickly .
ghana is a case in point . europe should not hand its neighbor continent over to china .
it is important to establish wide-ranging connections , social contacts and networks to get to know each other so that everybody can recognize their common interest .
the german president knows this , which is why he has launched his africa initiative .
with his continuing engagement and his third trip to africa , he wants to make sure that africa remains on the german government 's agenda . germany could set certain things in motion for africa , both in the eu and at the g8 summit .
this could happen in theory at least , since other topics - the constitutional process or relations to central asia - are seen as the more urgent priorities of the german eu presidency .
the german government , however , is planning to address the issues of african economic conditions and development at the g8 level .
is that the first sign that the old europe is waking up and beginning to see its own chances in africa ?

illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .
he 's hoping to convince his counterparts that a central eu data base on crime is urgently needed . fighting crime and reforming laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries is in the mood for reforms meanwhile , german justice minister brigitte zypries , for her part , wants to promote tougher legislation against racially motivated crimes , including the denial of the holocaust .
a german proposal seeks to criminalize all racist declarations that incite violence against a single person or specific group of people . but the german justice minister also called for harmonization of a wide range of other legal issues .
she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .
in addition , there are about one million divorces in the eu each year , and 20 percent of them involve people from two different european nations .
so , there 's a dire need to have clearer legislation as to how to deal with such transnational cases in the bloc . " the dresden meeting of eu interior and justice ministers is an informal one , so no immediate policy changes are expected .
it is hoped though that many of the proposals made in dresden will be turned into law later this year . hardy graupner / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , african officials discuss immigration ministers from more than 50 eu and african countries are expected to conclude a conference in the libyan capital tripoli on migration flows and development with a joint declaration on migration issues .

" he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .
" sarkozy , the quintessential macho , is usually quick and without scruples bordering brutality when he 's trying to hit an opponent .
his ability to punch has worked well in a political world dominated by men .
it wo n't be of much use against madame royal . " der tagesspiegel in berlin opined that it was time for president jacques chirac to rally behind his party colleague : " sarkozy 's nomination is a last defeat for chirac , who has done everything to prevent this .
but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .
both have remained political outsiders , who will have to fight against the establishment . "
" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .
ms royal also offers france and europe a break from the political past .
but her socially inclusive and pragmatic approach offers her country and our continent a much more constructive and trustworthy way forward than mr sarkozy 's . "
the times of london saw things differently .
" it is now official : in their next presidential election , french voters will face a choice between mr sarkozy 's pugnacious style and - he promises - uncompromising reforms , and the sweeping , sentimental generalities of segolene royal , the first woman to run for the elysee palace .
it is , in essence , a choice between a long-delayed and sorely-needed dose of gallic thatcherism , and a romantic reaffirmation of the socialist consensus that has cosseted the french public sector for so long that even france 's long-suffering taxpayers can no longer afford it .
both options are revolutionary , but the latter is revolutionary only because ms royal is a woman .
indeed , she has said that a win for her campaign would be a ' revolutionary gesture , ' and 40 per cent of voters have apparently opined in polls that her principal strength is her gender ... mr sarkozy , meanwhile , is walking a political tightrope .
he will need the votes of many on the right who backed jean marie le pen and the national front in 2002 , and he has already signalled that he favours a robust immigration policy .
but he can not afford to lose the entire immigrant vote in the process , and has floated positive discrimination schemes in a bid to broaden his appeal .
they would have helped his immigrant father , and if they help him to become president , that would help france . "

dw 's ute schaeffer says germany and europe urgently need to rethink their policy towards africa . ghana - the country that german president horst köhler just visited for four days - is for african standards a model state .
the country 's progress , however , is still governed by foreign factors , both old and new .
traditionally , african development has been influenced by donor nations in europe and the usa .
more recently , the emerging economies of india and china have become factors of influence as well .
chinese investments in ghana , for instance , have long exceeded those of great britain .
china is pushing its way into the west african state with all its might . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer globalization and rapid growth of the emerging economies have outrun the classical , european type of development policy .
africa is now part of a new international architecture . ghanaians living abroad transfer up to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to their homeland every year , making a significant contribution to its economic growth .
in ghana , like in other parts of africa , doors remain wide open for china and india . europe has so far missed on this development and that 's what the german president is concerned about .
the old development recipes are no longer effective .
europe 's outdated africa policy , in which everybody takes care of their own , personal africa , should be dead and buried .
how long does europe think it can keep its markets protected from african products ?
how long can europe keep believing that it can prevent migration from the neighboring continent using high walls , border controls or reception camps in the north african desert ? the european policy toward africa , which is shaped by fear and protectionism , is limiting africa 's potential that others have long noticed and taken advantage of .
europe should become more aware of its own interests in africa , including , for example , the issue of energy .
at the moment , africa produces 12 percent of the world 's crude oil supplies .
by 2010 , that amount will double .
the continent has over 50 million tons of natural gas at its disposal , which is one third of the deposits in the world . africa 's unused potentials include its manpower .
europe needs immigrants as well temporary foreign workers .
migrations - from africa and elsewhere - must be legalized and africans , too , must be allowed temporary entry to europe .
not the least because africa is a growing market that countries like china and india have long noticed and started exploiting .
africa is developing quickly .
ghana is a case in point . europe should not hand its neighbor continent over to china .
it is important to establish wide-ranging connections , social contacts and networks to get to know each other so that everybody can recognize their common interest .
the german president knows this , which is why he has launched his africa initiative .
with his continuing engagement and his third trip to africa , he wants to make sure that africa remains on the german government 's agenda . germany could set certain things in motion for africa , both in the eu and at the g8 summit .
this could happen in theory at least , since other topics - the constitutional process or relations to central asia - are seen as the more urgent priorities of the german eu presidency .
the german government , however , is planning to address the issues of african economic conditions and development at the g8 level .
is that the first sign that the old europe is waking up and beginning to see its own chances in africa ?

hoping to increase awareness for development issues , germany plans to introduce a new volunteer service for young people in 2008 .
most experts welcomed the idea in principle , but expressed concerns about logistics . when german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul recently announced her plan for a new voluntary service abroad program , she said she was simply reacting to an unmet demand . " every day , we are hearing from young people who want to do something , " the social democrat told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
" we want to respond to this desire to do something . " wieczorek-zeul 's response is aimed at people between the ages of 18 and 28 , who have a high school diploma or equivalent certificate and want to work in a developing country for three to 24 months . the ministry offers to pay 580 euros -lrb- $ 752 -rrb- per month to cover living costs .
in total , wieczorek-zeul plans to earmark 70 million euros for 10,000 participants .
the money will not come from existing programs , but new funds , according to a ministry spokesman . providing the means to volunteer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " we want teenagers , whose families do not have the means , to be able to volunteer abroad , " she told the paper , adding that existing volunteer programs often come with a hefty price tag . those working in the field generally welcomed the idea . " we think it 's a positive thing that the ministry is getting involved , " said jan gildemeister , the executive director of action committee service for peace -lrb- acsp -rrb- , an umbrella organization for christian groups that offer voluntary service programs abroad . " they want to increase awareness of development aid issues among young people and we welcome that , " he added .
" it 's the program itself that we 're concerned about . " protecting quality gildemeister said that it was important to work closely with non-governmental organizations in developing countries to make sure that they had the necessary resources to deal with volunteers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone who wants to volunteer abroad necessarily meets the requirements " you have to realize that volunteers need training and supervision , " gildemeister said , adding that it has taken acsp members years to establish ties with partner organizations abroad . carefully selecting candidates was another issue to consider , he said , counting a certain level of independence and language skills as essentials for people interested in volunteering in developing countries . " you ca n't send an 18-year-old to tanzania who 's lacking those skills , " he said , adding that he was looking forward to discussing these and other issues during a meeting with ministry officials on thursday . who benefits ? christof hartmann , a professor for development policy at the university of duisburg-essen , also questioned the usefulness of sending unskilled germans to developing countries as aid workers . " there are enough qualified people in these countries , " he said .
" if there 's a need for people , it 's for experts in selected areas , not someone who 'll help out at the hospital or can fill in excel spreadsheets . " hartmann added that young people in germany could certainly benefit from exposure to development issues .

hoping to increase awareness for development issues , germany plans to introduce a new volunteer service for young people in 2008 .
most experts welcomed the idea in principle , but expressed concerns about logistics . when german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul recently announced her plan for a new voluntary service abroad program , she said she was simply reacting to an unmet demand . " every day , we are hearing from young people who want to do something , " the social democrat told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
" we want to respond to this desire to do something . " wieczorek-zeul 's response is aimed at people between the ages of 18 and 28 , who have a high school diploma or equivalent certificate and want to work in a developing country for three to 24 months . the ministry offers to pay 580 euros -lrb- $ 752 -rrb- per month to cover living costs .
in total , wieczorek-zeul plans to earmark 70 million euros for 10,000 participants .
the money will not come from existing programs , but new funds , according to a ministry spokesman . providing the means to volunteer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " we want teenagers , whose families do not have the means , to be able to volunteer abroad , " she told the paper , adding that existing volunteer programs often come with a hefty price tag . those working in the field generally welcomed the idea . " we think it 's a positive thing that the ministry is getting involved , " said jan gildemeister , the executive director of action committee service for peace -lrb- acsp -rrb- , an umbrella organization for christian groups that offer voluntary service programs abroad . " they want to increase awareness of development aid issues among young people and we welcome that , " he added .
" it 's the program itself that we 're concerned about . " protecting quality gildemeister said that it was important to work closely with non-governmental organizations in developing countries to make sure that they had the necessary resources to deal with volunteers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone who wants to volunteer abroad necessarily meets the requirements " you have to realize that volunteers need training and supervision , " gildemeister said , adding that it has taken acsp members years to establish ties with partner organizations abroad . carefully selecting candidates was another issue to consider , he said , counting a certain level of independence and language skills as essentials for people interested in volunteering in developing countries . " you ca n't send an 18-year-old to tanzania who 's lacking those skills , " he said , adding that he was looking forward to discussing these and other issues during a meeting with ministry officials on thursday . who benefits ? christof hartmann , a professor for development policy at the university of duisburg-essen , also questioned the usefulness of sending unskilled germans to developing countries as aid workers . " there are enough qualified people in these countries , " he said .

" he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .
" sarkozy , the quintessential macho , is usually quick and without scruples bordering brutality when he 's trying to hit an opponent .
his ability to punch has worked well in a political world dominated by men .
it wo n't be of much use against madame royal . " der tagesspiegel in berlin opined that it was time for president jacques chirac to rally behind his party colleague : " sarkozy 's nomination is a last defeat for chirac , who has done everything to prevent this .
but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .
both have remained political outsiders , who will have to fight against the establishment . "
" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .
ms royal also offers france and europe a break from the political past .

" it is now official : in their next presidential election , french voters will face a choice between mr sarkozy 's pugnacious style and - he promises - uncompromising reforms , and the sweeping , sentimental generalities of segolene royal , the first woman to run for the elysee palace .
it is , in essence , a choice between a long-delayed and sorely-needed dose of gallic thatcherism , and a romantic reaffirmation of the socialist consensus that has cosseted the french public sector for so long that even france 's long-suffering taxpayers can no longer afford it .

" he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .
" sarkozy , the quintessential macho , is usually quick and without scruples bordering brutality when he 's trying to hit an opponent .
his ability to punch has worked well in a political world dominated by men .
it wo n't be of much use against madame royal . " der tagesspiegel in berlin opined that it was time for president jacques chirac to rally behind his party colleague : " sarkozy 's nomination is a last defeat for chirac , who has done everything to prevent this .
but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .
both have remained political outsiders , who will have to fight against the establishment . "
" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .
ms royal also offers france and europe a break from the political past .
but her socially inclusive and pragmatic approach offers her country and our continent a much more constructive and trustworthy way forward than mr sarkozy 's . "
the times of london saw things differently .
" it is now official : in their next presidential election , french voters will face a choice between mr sarkozy 's pugnacious style and - he promises - uncompromising reforms , and the sweeping , sentimental generalities of segolene royal , the first woman to run for the elysee palace .
it is , in essence , a choice between a long-delayed and sorely-needed dose of gallic thatcherism , and a romantic reaffirmation of the socialist consensus that has cosseted the french public sector for so long that even france 's long-suffering taxpayers can no longer afford it .
both options are revolutionary , but the latter is revolutionary only because ms royal is a woman .
indeed , she has said that a win for her campaign would be a ' revolutionary gesture , ' and 40 per cent of voters have apparently opined in polls that her principal strength is her gender ... mr sarkozy , meanwhile , is walking a political tightrope .

illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .
he 's hoping to convince his counterparts that a central eu data base on crime is urgently needed . fighting crime and reforming laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries is in the mood for reforms meanwhile , german justice minister brigitte zypries , for her part , wants to promote tougher legislation against racially motivated crimes , including the denial of the holocaust .
a german proposal seeks to criminalize all racist declarations that incite violence against a single person or specific group of people . but the german justice minister also called for harmonization of a wide range of other legal issues .
she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .

illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .
he 's hoping to convince his counterparts that a central eu data base on crime is urgently needed . fighting crime and reforming laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries is in the mood for reforms meanwhile , german justice minister brigitte zypries , for her part , wants to promote tougher legislation against racially motivated crimes , including the denial of the holocaust .
a german proposal seeks to criminalize all racist declarations that incite violence against a single person or specific group of people . but the german justice minister also called for harmonization of a wide range of other legal issues .
she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .
in addition , there are about one million divorces in the eu each year , and 20 percent of them involve people from two different european nations .

illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .
he 's hoping to convince his counterparts that a central eu data base on crime is urgently needed . fighting crime and reforming laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries is in the mood for reforms meanwhile , german justice minister brigitte zypries , for her part , wants to promote tougher legislation against racially motivated crimes , including the denial of the holocaust .
a german proposal seeks to criminalize all racist declarations that incite violence against a single person or specific group of people . but the german justice minister also called for harmonization of a wide range of other legal issues .
she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .
in addition , there are about one million divorces in the eu each year , and 20 percent of them involve people from two different european nations .
so , there 's a dire need to have clearer legislation as to how to deal with such transnational cases in the bloc . " the dresden meeting of eu interior and justice ministers is an informal one , so no immediate policy changes are expected .
it is hoped though that many of the proposals made in dresden will be turned into law later this year . hardy graupner / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , african officials discuss immigration ministers from more than 50 eu and african countries are expected to conclude a conference in the libyan capital tripoli on migration flows and development with a joint declaration on migration issues .

dw 's ute schaeffer says germany and europe urgently need to rethink their policy towards africa . ghana - the country that german president horst köhler just visited for four days - is for african standards a model state .
the country 's progress , however , is still governed by foreign factors , both old and new .
traditionally , african development has been influenced by donor nations in europe and the usa .
more recently , the emerging economies of india and china have become factors of influence as well .
chinese investments in ghana , for instance , have long exceeded those of great britain .
china is pushing its way into the west african state with all its might . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer globalization and rapid growth of the emerging economies have outrun the classical , european type of development policy .
africa is now part of a new international architecture . ghanaians living abroad transfer up to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to their homeland every year , making a significant contribution to its economic growth .
in ghana , like in other parts of africa , doors remain wide open for china and india . europe has so far missed on this development and that 's what the german president is concerned about .
the old development recipes are no longer effective .
europe 's outdated africa policy , in which everybody takes care of their own , personal africa , should be dead and buried .
how long does europe think it can keep its markets protected from african products ?
how long can europe keep believing that it can prevent migration from the neighboring continent using high walls , border controls or reception camps in the north african desert ? the european policy toward africa , which is shaped by fear and protectionism , is limiting africa 's potential that others have long noticed and taken advantage of .
europe should become more aware of its own interests in africa , including , for example , the issue of energy .
at the moment , africa produces 12 percent of the world 's crude oil supplies .
by 2010 , that amount will double .
the continent has over 50 million tons of natural gas at its disposal , which is one third of the deposits in the world . africa 's unused potentials include its manpower .
europe needs immigrants as well temporary foreign workers .
migrations - from africa and elsewhere - must be legalized and africans , too , must be allowed temporary entry to europe .
not the least because africa is a growing market that countries like china and india have long noticed and started exploiting .
africa is developing quickly .
ghana is a case in point . europe should not hand its neighbor continent over to china .
it is important to establish wide-ranging connections , social contacts and networks to get to know each other so that everybody can recognize their common interest .
the german president knows this , which is why he has launched his africa initiative .
with his continuing engagement and his third trip to africa , he wants to make sure that africa remains on the german government 's agenda . germany could set certain things in motion for africa , both in the eu and at the g8 summit .

" in the context of school supervision , the lawmaker can decide on rules regarding the extent to which teachers are banned from wearing external symbols and pieces of clothing that express a religious or ideological conviction while teaching , " said judge karl huber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike in france , german students are allowed to wear headscarves an islamic religious group , which brought the case to the court , claimed that the bavarian headscarf ban - which was adopted in november 2004 - was unconstitutional because it did not treat all religions as equal , outlawing only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols . the state government , on the other hand , argued that the hijab - a headscarf which is meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family - was clashing with gender equality , which is guaranteed by the constitution . this latest legal wrangle over headscarves highlights the inconsistency of bavaria 's state 's school law .
it says that no-one is allowed to wear religious symbols in the classroom - except christians and jews . all or none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is , among other things , about reconciling islam with western values the heated debate was first sparked in 2003 when germany 's federal constitutional court ruled that muslims could wear their headscarves while teaching but at the same time encouraged new laws to ban religious symbols .
eight german states , including berlin , have so far passed school laws that ban headscarves . unlike other headscarf-banning states , which saw the muslim attire as an affront to christian values , berlin decided to treat all religious symbols on an equal basis . " berlin is the only city and german state which has not only banned the headscarf , but all religious symbols in schools - that is the big difference , " said günther piening , who is the berlin commissioner for integration and migration . " i think that 's the only way to do it , because the general ban does not discriminate against one religion , " he added .
" it abides by the principle of equality as laid down in the german constitution . " women 's rights groups and conservative politicians , however , argue that many moslem women have no choice but to wear a headscarf because their families demand it .
yet , according to a recent survey conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , 97 percent of those women asked said it was the duty of a muslim woman to cover her head and that they should be allowed to wear them wherever and whenever they choose - an opinion not shared by the vast majority of germans . not a political statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz sees the headscarf as a sign of separation and unwillingness to integrate according to the deputy secretary general of the konrad adenauer foundation , christoph kannengiesser , the wearing of a headscarf is not necessarily a political statement and it should not stop the communication between muslims and germans . " we must not allow muslim women to separate themselves from german society , " kannengiesser said .
" we have to work harder to integrate them and the women also have to be willing to integrate .
muslims , however , are part of german society and we have to accept it if muslim girls and women choose to wear the headscarf . " the headscarf debate remains a political hot potato .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has repeatedly called on moslems to accept different opinions on the role of women and the wearing of headscarves . a few months ago , ekin deligöz , an ethnic turk and member of the green party in the german parliament , was placed under police protection after receiving death threats because she called on moslem women to take off their headscarves .

" in the context of school supervision , the lawmaker can decide on rules regarding the extent to which teachers are banned from wearing external symbols and pieces of clothing that express a religious or ideological conviction while teaching , " said judge karl huber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike in france , german students are allowed to wear headscarves an islamic religious group , which brought the case to the court , claimed that the bavarian headscarf ban - which was adopted in november 2004 - was unconstitutional because it did not treat all religions as equal , outlawing only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols . the state government , on the other hand , argued that the hijab - a headscarf which is meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family - was clashing with gender equality , which is guaranteed by the constitution . this latest legal wrangle over headscarves highlights the inconsistency of bavaria 's state 's school law .
it says that no-one is allowed to wear religious symbols in the classroom - except christians and jews . all or none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is , among other things , about reconciling islam with western values the heated debate was first sparked in 2003 when germany 's federal constitutional court ruled that muslims could wear their headscarves while teaching but at the same time encouraged new laws to ban religious symbols .
eight german states , including berlin , have so far passed school laws that ban headscarves . unlike other headscarf-banning states , which saw the muslim attire as an affront to christian values , berlin decided to treat all religious symbols on an equal basis . " berlin is the only city and german state which has not only banned the headscarf , but all religious symbols in schools - that is the big difference , " said günther piening , who is the berlin commissioner for integration and migration . " i think that 's the only way to do it , because the general ban does not discriminate against one religion , " he added .
" it abides by the principle of equality as laid down in the german constitution . " women 's rights groups and conservative politicians , however , argue that many moslem women have no choice but to wear a headscarf because their families demand it .
yet , according to a recent survey conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , 97 percent of those women asked said it was the duty of a muslim woman to cover her head and that they should be allowed to wear them wherever and whenever they choose - an opinion not shared by the vast majority of germans . not a political statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz sees the headscarf as a sign of separation and unwillingness to integrate according to the deputy secretary general of the konrad adenauer foundation , christoph kannengiesser , the wearing of a headscarf is not necessarily a political statement and it should not stop the communication between muslims and germans . " we must not allow muslim women to separate themselves from german society , " kannengiesser said .

india 's automobile sector is currently growing at an estimated 17 percent a year . add that to an annual growth rate of almost 10 percent and it 's not difficult to see why the german car industry - which has thus far focused largely on china - is increasingly training its sights on india . daimlerchrysler , vw lead the way earlier this month , daimlerchrysler ag , the world 's second-largest luxury carmaker , said it was investing 44 million euros -lrb- $ 57 million -rrb- to build a new assembly plant in the western indian state of maharashtra .

the plant will manufacture the passat and other models . volkswagen 's affiliate audi ag will also begin work on producing the a6 sedan in india this year . mercedes as a status symbol " the indian car market has huge growth potential , " said thomas becker , deputy head of the german car industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- .
he pointed out that german carmakers in india saw growth rates of over 33 percent in 2006 , double the rate of the indian market as a whole . though german carmakers only have a market share of around one percent in india , becker stressed that it was changing fast given that they had a solid presence in the luxury car segment .

" the cars are a ' statement ' and they 're the vehicle of choice for many managers , " chenoy said .
" the main buyers are big companies , " said chenoy , adding that the mercedes is usually bought by an increasingly affluent new class of entrepreneurs in northern india . problems remain despite india 's robustly growing economy and surging consumer confidence , the country 's road network , hampered by potholes and heavy congestion , still needs to be expanded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's terrible roads remain a huge barrier to foreign investment german carmakers say that strengthens the case for setting up their own production plants in india , also arguing that in light of high indian import tariffs , it makes sense to ship auto parts from germany and assemble the cars in india . " this process is usually preferred as a first step towards setting up your own production in many emerging markets , " becker said , adding that the operation in no way undermined the performance of the car or damaged germany 's high reputation for quality products . german carmakers say that one way to lower high import tariffs and dismantle other barriers to investment in india would be to set up a free-trade zone between the eu and india next year .

india 's automobile sector is currently growing at an estimated 17 percent a year . add that to an annual growth rate of almost 10 percent and it 's not difficult to see why the german car industry - which has thus far focused largely on china - is increasingly training its sights on india . daimlerchrysler , vw lead the way earlier this month , daimlerchrysler ag , the world 's second-largest luxury carmaker , said it was investing 44 million euros -lrb- $ 57 million -rrb- to build a new assembly plant in the western indian state of maharashtra .
the state is already home to factories of tata , renault and fiat spa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercedes s-class symbolizes top quality in india by 2009 , the stuttgart-based german-american carmaker - which currently assembles the e-class , c-class and s-class models in india - plans to roll out a further 5,000 luxury models a year . wolfsburg-based volkswagen last year signed a whopping deal worth 410 million euros - the single-biggest foreign investment in indian so far - with the government of maharashtra to set up a production facility on the outskirts of the rapidly growing city of pune .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 15.01.2007 " we want to get china working with the eu on climate change " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner is hoping for chinese cooperation on a wealth of topics eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who will be in beijing from january 16-18 for talks with chinese leaders , spoke to dw-radio about her visit and the state of relations between the eu and china . the european union and china are set to open talks on a new cooperation treaty in beijing this week as part of a joint drive to forge closer political and economic ties . negotiations on the new accord will be opened by eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner who will be in beijing from january 16-18 for talks with chinese leaders .
ferrero-waldner spoke to dw-radio about the upcoming visit and the state of relations between the eu and china . dw : how would you sum up the current state of relations between the eu and china ? ferrero-waldner : i would say that relations are very comprehensive and very important but we also see that in our trade cooperation agreement that we have from 1985 , these strategic partnerships that we have today with china , this old agreement is no longer up to the job .

" but we need to be realistic and look into how much can be achieved in how long . " six billion tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- a year pour into the atmosphere worldwide from sources such as power stations , chemical plants and steel foundries .
co2 contributes to global warming by trapping the sun ’ s rays in the atmosphere . merkel 's coalition partners from the spd remain strongly opposed to any changes to the phase-out plan . " the nuclear phase-out is possible along with a tightening of climate protection , " said ulrich kelber , deputy president of the spd parliamentary bloc . germany itself is divided over nuclear issues .
according to a forsa poll published on sunday , one half of germans are either in favor of prolonging the life of the country 's nuclear power plants or abandoning the nuclear phase-out altogether .
the other half would like to stick to the plan to shut the nuclear plants down . last week , the eu unveiled sweeping plans to diversify energy sources , limit greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and increase the use of renewable energy sources . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's criticism of russia over energy marks shift in ties chancellor angela merkel 's rebuke of russia over it halting oil supplies to europe has revealed a possible shift in ties between the two countries .
-lrb- 13.01.2007 -rrb- germany changes stance to support eu energy liberalization germany is no longer opposed to proposals by the european commission to liberalize the energy market and is open to separating energy producers from their distribution networks , the country 's economy minister said .

" he said the plan would allow investigators from an eu nation for the first time to have access to a dna or fingerprint databank of crime suspects in all other eu member states .
the only prerequisite , schäuble said , would be that a formal investigation would first have to be opened . widening existing treaty schäuble 's plan is n't entirely new .
it touches upon an existing agreement called the " prüm treaty " on police cooperation which seven states have already signed . named after the western german town where it was signed in 2005 , it allows participating nations mutual and automatic access to dna and fingerprint records , as well as car registration information .
the treaty allows police to pursue fugitives across another eu state 's border in case of imminent danger to individuals .
it also allows joint police patrols . but the treaty is only operational in germany , austria and spain . " our aim is to create a modern police information network for more effective crime control throughout europe , " schäuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan will lead to more cross-border cooperation in the eu schäuble also pointed out that in the six weeks that the prüm system has been in operation , the sharing of information between germany and austria has led to 1,500 dna matches , including 32 in homicide cases and 23 in rape or sexual assault cases . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the treaty would achieve two seemingly contradictory goals - making sensitive data available to security authorities while protecting the privacy rights of eu citizens . schäuble added that the information database would be used by police forces , not national intelligence agencies . not everyone in favor the german minister said monday that most eu member states had backed the idea of enshrining the prüm treaty in eu law . " we have had a very broad consensus .
i am pleasantly surprised , " schäuble said . " dna is today the most effective means of solving crime , " said french regional development minister christian estrosi , who represented french interior minister nicolas sarkozy at the talks .
on an eu-wide level " we could solve thousands of crimes much more quickly , " he added . however eu members britain , czech republic , ireland and poland said they needed more time to think about the treaty for fear that it might be too expensive to update their existing databanks . all states need to agree for the treaty to become eu law .
the european commission will put forward a formal proposal next month . schäuble 's proposal was criticized monday by germany 's opposition free-market liberals , the fdp .
the debate among eu ministers in dresden showed " the low premium that is put on civil rights and data security in eu legal and interior policy , " said gisela piltz , fdp spokeswoman on security affairs . more cooperation with us ? schäuble also said he could n't rule out opening germany 's police databank containing dna and digital fingerprint information to the us . the minister , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said the issue was first raised by representatives of the us department of the interior in september last year in order to help in the hunt for terrorism suspects who could be hiding in germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany launches eu initiative to tackle right-wing extremism germany has put forward measures to help europe unite forces in the battle against the far-right .

" he said the plan would allow investigators from an eu nation for the first time to have access to a dna or fingerprint databank of crime suspects in all other eu member states .
the only prerequisite , schäuble said , would be that a formal investigation would first have to be opened . widening existing treaty schäuble 's plan is n't entirely new .
it touches upon an existing agreement called the " prüm treaty " on police cooperation which seven states have already signed . named after the western german town where it was signed in 2005 , it allows participating nations mutual and automatic access to dna and fingerprint records , as well as car registration information .
the treaty allows police to pursue fugitives across another eu state 's border in case of imminent danger to individuals .
it also allows joint police patrols . but the treaty is only operational in germany , austria and spain . " our aim is to create a modern police information network for more effective crime control throughout europe , " schäuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan will lead to more cross-border cooperation in the eu schäuble also pointed out that in the six weeks that the prüm system has been in operation , the sharing of information between germany and austria has led to 1,500 dna matches , including 32 in homicide cases and 23 in rape or sexual assault cases . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the treaty would achieve two seemingly contradictory goals - making sensitive data available to security authorities while protecting the privacy rights of eu citizens . schäuble added that the information database would be used by police forces , not national intelligence agencies . not everyone in favor the german minister said monday that most eu member states had backed the idea of enshrining the prüm treaty in eu law . " we have had a very broad consensus .
i am pleasantly surprised , " schäuble said . " dna is today the most effective means of solving crime , " said french regional development minister christian estrosi , who represented french interior minister nicolas sarkozy at the talks .
on an eu-wide level " we could solve thousands of crimes much more quickly , " he added . however eu members britain , czech republic , ireland and poland said they needed more time to think about the treaty for fear that it might be too expensive to update their existing databanks . all states need to agree for the treaty to become eu law .
the european commission will put forward a formal proposal next month . schäuble 's proposal was criticized monday by germany 's opposition free-market liberals , the fdp .
the debate among eu ministers in dresden showed " the low premium that is put on civil rights and data security in eu legal and interior policy , " said gisela piltz , fdp spokeswoman on security affairs . more cooperation with us ? schäuble also said he could n't rule out opening germany 's police databank containing dna and digital fingerprint information to the us . the minister , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said the issue was first raised by representatives of the us department of the interior in september last year in order to help in the hunt for terrorism suspects who could be hiding in germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany launches eu initiative to tackle right-wing extremism germany has put forward measures to help europe unite forces in the battle against the far-right .

dw 's ute schaeffer says germany and europe urgently need to rethink their policy towards africa . ghana - the country that german president horst köhler just visited for four days - is for african standards a model state .
the country 's progress , however , is still governed by foreign factors , both old and new .
traditionally , african development has been influenced by donor nations in europe and the usa .
more recently , the emerging economies of india and china have become factors of influence as well .
chinese investments in ghana , for instance , have long exceeded those of great britain .
china is pushing its way into the west african state with all its might . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer globalization and rapid growth of the emerging economies have outrun the classical , european type of development policy .
africa is now part of a new international architecture . ghanaians living abroad transfer up to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to their homeland every year , making a significant contribution to its economic growth .
in ghana , like in other parts of africa , doors remain wide open for china and india . europe has so far missed on this development and that 's what the german president is concerned about .
the old development recipes are no longer effective .
europe 's outdated africa policy , in which everybody takes care of their own , personal africa , should be dead and buried .
how long does europe think it can keep its markets protected from african products ?
how long can europe keep believing that it can prevent migration from the neighboring continent using high walls , border controls or reception camps in the north african desert ? the european policy toward africa , which is shaped by fear and protectionism , is limiting africa 's potential that others have long noticed and taken advantage of .
europe should become more aware of its own interests in africa , including , for example , the issue of energy .
at the moment , africa produces 12 percent of the world 's crude oil supplies .
by 2010 , that amount will double .
the continent has over 50 million tons of natural gas at its disposal , which is one third of the deposits in the world . africa 's unused potentials include its manpower .
europe needs immigrants as well temporary foreign workers .
migrations - from africa and elsewhere - must be legalized and africans , too , must be allowed temporary entry to europe .
not the least because africa is a growing market that countries like china and india have long noticed and started exploiting .
africa is developing quickly .
ghana is a case in point . europe should not hand its neighbor continent over to china .
it is important to establish wide-ranging connections , social contacts and networks to get to know each other so that everybody can recognize their common interest .
the german president knows this , which is why he has launched his africa initiative .
with his continuing engagement and his third trip to africa , he wants to make sure that africa remains on the german government 's agenda . germany could set certain things in motion for africa , both in the eu and at the g8 summit .
this could happen in theory at least , since other topics - the constitutional process or relations to central asia - are seen as the more urgent priorities of the german eu presidency .
the german government , however , is planning to address the issues of african economic conditions and development at the g8 level .

" he said the plan would allow investigators from an eu nation for the first time to have access to a dna or fingerprint databank of crime suspects in all other eu member states .
the only prerequisite , schäuble said , would be that a formal investigation would first have to be opened . widening existing treaty schäuble 's plan is n't entirely new .
it touches upon an existing agreement called the " prüm treaty " on police cooperation which seven states have already signed . named after the western german town where it was signed in 2005 , it allows participating nations mutual and automatic access to dna and fingerprint records , as well as car registration information .
the treaty allows police to pursue fugitives across another eu state 's border in case of imminent danger to individuals .
it also allows joint police patrols . but the treaty is only operational in germany , austria and spain . " our aim is to create a modern police information network for more effective crime control throughout europe , " schäuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan will lead to more cross-border cooperation in the eu schäuble also pointed out that in the six weeks that the prüm system has been in operation , the sharing of information between germany and austria has led to 1,500 dna matches , including 32 in homicide cases and 23 in rape or sexual assault cases . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the treaty would achieve two seemingly contradictory goals - making sensitive data available to security authorities while protecting the privacy rights of eu citizens . schäuble added that the information database would be used by police forces , not national intelligence agencies . not everyone in favor the german minister said monday that most eu member states had backed the idea of enshrining the prüm treaty in eu law . " we have had a very broad consensus .
i am pleasantly surprised , " schäuble said . " dna is today the most effective means of solving crime , " said french regional development minister christian estrosi , who represented french interior minister nicolas sarkozy at the talks .
on an eu-wide level " we could solve thousands of crimes much more quickly , " he added . however eu members britain , czech republic , ireland and poland said they needed more time to think about the treaty for fear that it might be too expensive to update their existing databanks . all states need to agree for the treaty to become eu law .
the european commission will put forward a formal proposal next month . schäuble 's proposal was criticized monday by germany 's opposition free-market liberals , the fdp .
the debate among eu ministers in dresden showed " the low premium that is put on civil rights and data security in eu legal and interior policy , " said gisela piltz , fdp spokeswoman on security affairs . more cooperation with us ? schäuble also said he could n't rule out opening germany 's police databank containing dna and digital fingerprint information to the us . the minister , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said the issue was first raised by representatives of the us department of the interior in september last year in order to help in the hunt for terrorism suspects who could be hiding in germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany launches eu initiative to tackle right-wing extremism germany has put forward measures to help europe unite forces in the battle against the far-right .

hoping to increase awareness for development issues , germany plans to introduce a new volunteer service for young people in 2008 .
most experts welcomed the idea in principle , but expressed concerns about logistics . when german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul recently announced her plan for a new voluntary service abroad program , she said she was simply reacting to an unmet demand . " every day , we are hearing from young people who want to do something , " the social democrat told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
" we want to respond to this desire to do something . " wieczorek-zeul 's response is aimed at people between the ages of 18 and 28 , who have a high school diploma or equivalent certificate and want to work in a developing country for three to 24 months . the ministry offers to pay 580 euros -lrb- $ 752 -rrb- per month to cover living costs .
in total , wieczorek-zeul plans to earmark 70 million euros for 10,000 participants .
the money will not come from existing programs , but new funds , according to a ministry spokesman . providing the means to volunteer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " we want teenagers , whose families do not have the means , to be able to volunteer abroad , " she told the paper , adding that existing volunteer programs often come with a hefty price tag . those working in the field generally welcomed the idea . " we think it 's a positive thing that the ministry is getting involved , " said jan gildemeister , the executive director of action committee service for peace -lrb- acsp -rrb- , an umbrella organization for christian groups that offer voluntary service programs abroad . " they want to increase awareness of development aid issues among young people and we welcome that , " he added .
" it 's the program itself that we 're concerned about . " protecting quality gildemeister said that it was important to work closely with non-governmental organizations in developing countries to make sure that they had the necessary resources to deal with volunteers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone who wants to volunteer abroad necessarily meets the requirements " you have to realize that volunteers need training and supervision , " gildemeister said , adding that it has taken acsp members years to establish ties with partner organizations abroad . carefully selecting candidates was another issue to consider , he said , counting a certain level of independence and language skills as essentials for people interested in volunteering in developing countries . " you ca n't send an 18-year-old to tanzania who 's lacking those skills , " he said , adding that he was looking forward to discussing these and other issues during a meeting with ministry officials on thursday . who benefits ? christof hartmann , a professor for development policy at the university of duisburg-essen , also questioned the usefulness of sending unskilled germans to developing countries as aid workers . " there are enough qualified people in these countries , " he said .
" if there 's a need for people , it 's for experts in selected areas , not someone who 'll help out at the hospital or can fill in excel spreadsheets .

hoping to increase awareness for development issues , germany plans to introduce a new volunteer service for young people in 2008 .
most experts welcomed the idea in principle , but expressed concerns about logistics . when german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul recently announced her plan for a new voluntary service abroad program , she said she was simply reacting to an unmet demand . " every day , we are hearing from young people who want to do something , " the social democrat told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
" we want to respond to this desire to do something . " wieczorek-zeul 's response is aimed at people between the ages of 18 and 28 , who have a high school diploma or equivalent certificate and want to work in a developing country for three to 24 months . the ministry offers to pay 580 euros -lrb- $ 752 -rrb- per month to cover living costs .
in total , wieczorek-zeul plans to earmark 70 million euros for 10,000 participants .
the money will not come from existing programs , but new funds , according to a ministry spokesman . providing the means to volunteer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " we want teenagers , whose families do not have the means , to be able to volunteer abroad , " she told the paper , adding that existing volunteer programs often come with a hefty price tag . those working in the field generally welcomed the idea . " we think it 's a positive thing that the ministry is getting involved , " said jan gildemeister , the executive director of action committee service for peace -lrb- acsp -rrb- , an umbrella organization for christian groups that offer voluntary service programs abroad . " they want to increase awareness of development aid issues among young people and we welcome that , " he added .
" it 's the program itself that we 're concerned about . " protecting quality gildemeister said that it was important to work closely with non-governmental organizations in developing countries to make sure that they had the necessary resources to deal with volunteers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone who wants to volunteer abroad necessarily meets the requirements " you have to realize that volunteers need training and supervision , " gildemeister said , adding that it has taken acsp members years to establish ties with partner organizations abroad . carefully selecting candidates was another issue to consider , he said , counting a certain level of independence and language skills as essentials for people interested in volunteering in developing countries . " you ca n't send an 18-year-old to tanzania who 's lacking those skills , " he said , adding that he was looking forward to discussing these and other issues during a meeting with ministry officials on thursday . who benefits ? christof hartmann , a professor for development policy at the university of duisburg-essen , also questioned the usefulness of sending unskilled germans to developing countries as aid workers .

most experts welcomed the idea in principle , but expressed concerns about logistics . when german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul recently announced her plan for a new voluntary service abroad program , she said she was simply reacting to an unmet demand . " every day , we are hearing from young people who want to do something , " the social democrat told the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
" we want to respond to this desire to do something . " wieczorek-zeul 's response is aimed at people between the ages of 18 and 28 , who have a high school diploma or equivalent certificate and want to work in a developing country for three to 24 months . the ministry offers to pay 580 euros -lrb- $ 752 -rrb- per month to cover living costs .
in total , wieczorek-zeul plans to earmark 70 million euros for 10,000 participants .
the money will not come from existing programs , but new funds , according to a ministry spokesman . providing the means to volunteer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " we want teenagers , whose families do not have the means , to be able to volunteer abroad , " she told the paper , adding that existing volunteer programs often come with a hefty price tag . those working in the field generally welcomed the idea . " we think it 's a positive thing that the ministry is getting involved , " said jan gildemeister , the executive director of action committee service for peace -lrb- acsp -rrb- , an umbrella organization for christian groups that offer voluntary service programs abroad . " they want to increase awareness of development aid issues among young people and we welcome that , " he added .
" it 's the program itself that we 're concerned about . " protecting quality gildemeister said that it was important to work closely with non-governmental organizations in developing countries to make sure that they had the necessary resources to deal with volunteers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone who wants to volunteer abroad necessarily meets the requirements " you have to realize that volunteers need training and supervision , " gildemeister said , adding that it has taken acsp members years to establish ties with partner organizations abroad . carefully selecting candidates was another issue to consider , he said , counting a certain level of independence and language skills as essentials for people interested in volunteering in developing countries . " you ca n't send an 18-year-old to tanzania who 's lacking those skills , " he said , adding that he was looking forward to discussing these and other issues during a meeting with ministry officials on thursday . who benefits ? christof hartmann , a professor for development policy at the university of duisburg-essen , also questioned the usefulness of sending unskilled germans to developing countries as aid workers . " there are enough qualified people in these countries , " he said .
" if there 's a need for people , it 's for experts in selected areas , not someone who 'll help out at the hospital or can fill in excel spreadsheets . " hartmann added that young people in germany could certainly benefit from exposure to development issues . " but the question is whether we want to view this as part of our development aid policy , " he said . new experiences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experiencing the real thing helps broaden horizons ute koczy , the development aid spokeswoman for the opposition greens party in parliament , agreed that it was important to make sure that the organizations abroad found the program useful . " it can not be that only youngsters get something out of it , " she said .
" but generally speaking , it 's the volunteers who benefit most from these kinds of trips .
it 's good to give young people the opportunity to get a taste of the world , but they should n't expect to change it within the course of three months . " mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as state shrinks , can volunteers fill gaps ?
volunteerism in germany is not as strong as it is in the us .
many germans traditionally felt it was the government 's role to take care of problems .
but as state coffers run dry , attitudes are changing .

this is the reason why during this trip my main purpose is to launch negotiations for the new partnership and cooperation agreement that will be much more comprehensive and which will build on this changing relationship that we have . in real terms , what do you hope to achieve ? in real terms , i think it will be necessary to really agree on providing a comprehensive framework for the 22 sectors in which the eu and china are already holding dialogues , including energy , the environment , agriculture , transport , education , science and technology but also key issues such as sustainable development , migration and of course the international challenges we both face such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction . on the topic of energy , china is a major global polluter .

therefore we think it is highly important that china take on our technologies .

ferrero-waldner spoke to dw-radio about the upcoming visit and the state of relations between the eu and china . dw : how would you sum up the current state of relations between the eu and china ? ferrero-waldner : i would say that relations are very comprehensive and very important but we also see that in our trade cooperation agreement that we have from 1985 , these strategic partnerships that we have today with china , this old agreement is no longer up to the job .
this is the reason why during this trip my main purpose is to launch negotiations for the new partnership and cooperation agreement that will be much more comprehensive and which will build on this changing relationship that we have . in real terms , what do you hope to achieve ? in real terms , i think it will be necessary to really agree on providing a comprehensive framework for the 22 sectors in which the eu and china are already holding dialogues , including energy , the environment , agriculture , transport , education , science and technology but also key issues such as sustainable development , migration and of course the international challenges we both face such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction . on the topic of energy , china is a major global polluter .
is there an implicit message from the eu which is " you must change what you are doing " ? we already have a partnership on climate change with china since september 2005 as well as various action plans and memorandums of understanding where we touch upon clean coal , energy efficiency and renewable energies in general .
but we think china is so big that whatever we do in reducing emissions could be offset by china .
therefore we think it is highly important that china take on our technologies .
for instance , clean coal technology with carbon capture because china is currently bringing one coal fired power plant online every week .
you can imagine what that means .
therefore we want to get china closely working together with us and we 're taking the lead here . what 's in this for china ? i think china itself realizes more and more , and is interested in having a development in their industry that in the end does not jeopardize the environment .
that is also in their interest . peter dobbie interviewed benita ferrero-waldner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu trade commissioner has harsh words for beijing on a visit to china , the eu 's trade commissioner has n't been mincing words .

india 's automobile sector is currently growing at an estimated 17 percent a year . add that to an annual growth rate of almost 10 percent and it 's not difficult to see why the german car industry - which has thus far focused largely on china - is increasingly training its sights on india . daimlerchrysler , vw lead the way earlier this month , daimlerchrysler ag , the world 's second-largest luxury carmaker , said it was investing 44 million euros -lrb- $ 57 million -rrb- to build a new assembly plant in the western indian state of maharashtra .

" the cars are a ' statement ' and they 're the vehicle of choice for many managers , " chenoy said .
" the main buyers are big companies , " said chenoy , adding that the mercedes is usually bought by an increasingly affluent new class of entrepreneurs in northern india . problems remain despite india 's robustly growing economy and surging consumer confidence , the country 's road network , hampered by potholes and heavy congestion , still needs to be expanded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's terrible roads remain a huge barrier to foreign investment german carmakers say that strengthens the case for setting up their own production plants in india , also arguing that in light of high indian import tariffs , it makes sense to ship auto parts from germany and assemble the cars in india .

india 's automobile sector is currently growing at an estimated 17 percent a year . add that to an annual growth rate of almost 10 percent and it 's not difficult to see why the german car industry - which has thus far focused largely on china - is increasingly training its sights on india . daimlerchrysler , vw lead the way earlier this month , daimlerchrysler ag , the world 's second-largest luxury carmaker , said it was investing 44 million euros -lrb- $ 57 million -rrb- to build a new assembly plant in the western indian state of maharashtra .

" in the context of school supervision , the lawmaker can decide on rules regarding the extent to which teachers are banned from wearing external symbols and pieces of clothing that express a religious or ideological conviction while teaching , " said judge karl huber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike in france , german students are allowed to wear headscarves an islamic religious group , which brought the case to the court , claimed that the bavarian headscarf ban - which was adopted in november 2004 - was unconstitutional because it did not treat all religions as equal , outlawing only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols . the state government , on the other hand , argued that the hijab - a headscarf which is meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family - was clashing with gender equality , which is guaranteed by the constitution . this latest legal wrangle over headscarves highlights the inconsistency of bavaria 's state 's school law .
it says that no-one is allowed to wear religious symbols in the classroom - except christians and jews . all or none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is , among other things , about reconciling islam with western values the heated debate was first sparked in 2003 when germany 's federal constitutional court ruled that muslims could wear their headscarves while teaching but at the same time encouraged new laws to ban religious symbols .
eight german states , including berlin , have so far passed school laws that ban headscarves . unlike other headscarf-banning states , which saw the muslim attire as an affront to christian values , berlin decided to treat all religious symbols on an equal basis . " berlin is the only city and german state which has not only banned the headscarf , but all religious symbols in schools - that is the big difference , " said günther piening , who is the berlin commissioner for integration and migration . " i think that 's the only way to do it , because the general ban does not discriminate against one religion , " he added .
" it abides by the principle of equality as laid down in the german constitution . " women 's rights groups and conservative politicians , however , argue that many moslem women have no choice but to wear a headscarf because their families demand it .
yet , according to a recent survey conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , 97 percent of those women asked said it was the duty of a muslim woman to cover her head and that they should be allowed to wear them wherever and whenever they choose - an opinion not shared by the vast majority of germans . not a political statement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz sees the headscarf as a sign of separation and unwillingness to integrate according to the deputy secretary general of the konrad adenauer foundation , christoph kannengiesser , the wearing of a headscarf is not necessarily a political statement and it should not stop the communication between muslims and germans . " we must not allow muslim women to separate themselves from german society , " kannengiesser said .
" we have to work harder to integrate them and the women also have to be willing to integrate .
muslims , however , are part of german society and we have to accept it if muslim girls and women choose to wear the headscarf . " the headscarf debate remains a political hot potato .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has repeatedly called on moslems to accept different opinions on the role of women and the wearing of headscarves . a few months ago , ekin deligöz , an ethnic turk and member of the green party in the german parliament , was placed under police protection after receiving death threats because she called on moslem women to take off their headscarves .

" in the context of school supervision , the lawmaker can decide on rules regarding the extent to which teachers are banned from wearing external symbols and pieces of clothing that express a religious or ideological conviction while teaching , " said judge karl huber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike in france , german students are allowed to wear headscarves an islamic religious group , which brought the case to the court , claimed that the bavarian headscarf ban - which was adopted in november 2004 - was unconstitutional because it did not treat all religions as equal , outlawing only the headscarf and not the christian cross or any other religious symbols . the state government , on the other hand , argued that the hijab - a headscarf which is meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family - was clashing with gender equality , which is guaranteed by the constitution . this latest legal wrangle over headscarves highlights the inconsistency of bavaria 's state 's school law .

" berlin is the only city and german state which has not only banned the headscarf , but all religious symbols in schools - that is the big difference , " said günther piening , who is the berlin commissioner for integration and migration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 15.01.2007 european press review : the quintessential macho großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sakozy wants to be a " president of the people " dw-world.de takes a look at comments in european papers about the nomination of french interior minister nicolas sarkozy as conservative candidate in the april presidential elections . sarkozy launched his campaign for the presidency at a triumphant party congress in paris sunday , issuing an appeal to voters of all persuasions to make him a " president of the people " at april 's election . in a speech before some 80,000 members of the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- , sarkozy set out the broad lines of his manifesto , promising to " reassert the value of work , " restore " authority and respect " and establish a society of " obligations as well as rights . " he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .
" sarkozy , the quintessential macho , is usually quick and without scruples bordering brutality when he 's trying to hit an opponent .
his ability to punch has worked well in a political world dominated by men .
it wo n't be of much use against madame royal . " der tagesspiegel in berlin opined that it was time for president jacques chirac to rally behind his party colleague : " sarkozy 's nomination is a last defeat for chirac , who has done everything to prevent this .
but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .
both have remained political outsiders , who will have to fight against the establishment . "
" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .
ms royal also offers france and europe a break from the political past .
but her socially inclusive and pragmatic approach offers her country and our continent a much more constructive and trustworthy way forward than mr sarkozy 's . "
the times of london saw things differently .
" it is now official : in their next presidential election , french voters will face a choice between mr sarkozy 's pugnacious style and - he promises - uncompromising reforms , and the sweeping , sentimental generalities of segolene royal , the first woman to run for the elysee palace .
it is , in essence , a choice between a long-delayed and sorely-needed dose of gallic thatcherism , and a romantic reaffirmation of the socialist consensus that has cosseted the french public sector for so long that even france 's long-suffering taxpayers can no longer afford it .
both options are revolutionary , but the latter is revolutionary only because ms royal is a woman .
indeed , she has said that a win for her campaign would be a ' revolutionary gesture , ' and 40 per cent of voters have apparently opined in polls that her principal strength is her gender ... mr sarkozy , meanwhile , is walking a political tightrope .
he will need the votes of many on the right who backed jean marie le pen and the national front in 2002 , and he has already signalled that he favours a robust immigration policy .
but he can not afford to lose the entire immigrant vote in the process , and has floated positive discrimination schemes in a bid to broaden his appeal .
they would have helped his immigrant father , and if they help him to become president , that would help france . "
and in paris , liberation commented : " yes , this man is dangerous , especially for the left .
he is not the caesar nor the napolean that one sometimes sees in him .
elected in a referendum by a large majority of his camp , interior minister sarkozy is his own master and steers the ship of modern conservatism .
energy , talent and organization have helped him to this triumph .
he 's got a tight grip on things and that 's worrying .

" he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .
" sarkozy , the quintessential macho , is usually quick and without scruples bordering brutality when he 's trying to hit an opponent .
his ability to punch has worked well in a political world dominated by men .
it wo n't be of much use against madame royal . " der tagesspiegel in berlin opined that it was time for president jacques chirac to rally behind his party colleague : " sarkozy 's nomination is a last defeat for chirac , who has done everything to prevent this .
but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .
both have remained political outsiders , who will have to fight against the establishment . "
" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .
ms royal also offers france and europe a break from the political past .
but her socially inclusive and pragmatic approach offers her country and our continent a much more constructive and trustworthy way forward than mr sarkozy 's . "
the times of london saw things differently .
" it is now official : in their next presidential election , french voters will face a choice between mr sarkozy 's pugnacious style and - he promises - uncompromising reforms , and the sweeping , sentimental generalities of segolene royal , the first woman to run for the elysee palace .
it is , in essence , a choice between a long-delayed and sorely-needed dose of gallic thatcherism , and a romantic reaffirmation of the socialist consensus that has cosseted the french public sector for so long that even france 's long-suffering taxpayers can no longer afford it .
both options are revolutionary , but the latter is revolutionary only because ms royal is a woman .
indeed , she has said that a win for her campaign would be a ' revolutionary gesture , ' and 40 per cent of voters have apparently opined in polls that her principal strength is her gender ... mr sarkozy , meanwhile , is walking a political tightrope .
he will need the votes of many on the right who backed jean marie le pen and the national front in 2002 , and he has already signalled that he favours a robust immigration policy .
but he can not afford to lose the entire immigrant vote in the process , and has floated positive discrimination schemes in a bid to broaden his appeal .
they would have helped his immigrant father , and if they help him to become president , that would help france . "

" he was speaking after results of the party 's internal ballot were announced to a jubilant audience , giving sarkozy more than 98 percent of votes cast .
some 69 percent of the party 's 338,000 members took part in the ballot , whose result was a foregone conclusion as sarkozy was the only person standing . the 51 year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , " sarko " - as he is widely called - is the only politician who polls say can beat segolene royal , the socialist contender who hopes to take over from jacques chirac to become france 's first woman president . " it wo n't be easy for him to succeed against a strong woman , who has learned to deploy softness as a weapon , " wrote munich 's süddeutsche zeitung .
" sarkozy , the quintessential macho , is usually quick and without scruples bordering brutality when he 's trying to hit an opponent .
his ability to punch has worked well in a political world dominated by men .
it wo n't be of much use against madame royal . " der tagesspiegel in berlin opined that it was time for president jacques chirac to rally behind his party colleague : " sarkozy 's nomination is a last defeat for chirac , who has done everything to prevent this .
but if he does n't back sarkozy even now , he 'll only strengthen the chances of the candidate of the far-right front national , jean-marie le pen .
the latter would profit directly from a clash within the conservative camp .
like his predecessors , chirac has governed the country as a kind of ersatz monarch .
that wo n't happen again , as neither the son of a hungarian immigrant nor the mother of four children will be able nor willing to fill that role .
both have remained political outsiders , who will have to fight against the establishment . "
" mr sarkozy is neither a shoo-in nor the president that france needs at such a difficult and delicate period in its history , " wrote london 's the guardian .
" mr sarkozy is an extremely divisive politician .
he has his work cut out , not just to win the presidency against the left candidate segolene royal -lrb- who is as undivisive as mr sarkozy is divisive -rrb- but also to rally the right around his own cause .
this will be a difficult balancing act .
mr sarkozy is provocative and ruthless and his electoral appeal - which combines anti-immigrant populism , middle-class social conservatism and extensive economic deregulation - does not offer a 21st-century european model that britain should embrace .
ms royal also offers france and europe a break from the political past .
but her socially inclusive and pragmatic approach offers her country and our continent a much more constructive and trustworthy way forward than mr sarkozy 's . "
the times of london saw things differently .
" it is now official : in their next presidential election , french voters will face a choice between mr sarkozy 's pugnacious style and - he promises - uncompromising reforms , and the sweeping , sentimental generalities of segolene royal , the first woman to run for the elysee palace .

illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .
he 's hoping to convince his counterparts that a central eu data base on crime is urgently needed . fighting crime and reforming laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries is in the mood for reforms meanwhile , german justice minister brigitte zypries , for her part , wants to promote tougher legislation against racially motivated crimes , including the denial of the holocaust .
a german proposal seeks to criminalize all racist declarations that incite violence against a single person or specific group of people . but the german justice minister also called for harmonization of a wide range of other legal issues .
she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .
in addition , there are about one million divorces in the eu each year , and 20 percent of them involve people from two different european nations .
so , there 's a dire need to have clearer legislation as to how to deal with such transnational cases in the bloc . " the dresden meeting of eu interior and justice ministers is an informal one , so no immediate policy changes are expected .

illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .
he 's hoping to convince his counterparts that a central eu data base on crime is urgently needed . fighting crime and reforming laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries is in the mood for reforms meanwhile , german justice minister brigitte zypries , for her part , wants to promote tougher legislation against racially motivated crimes , including the denial of the holocaust .
a german proposal seeks to criminalize all racist declarations that incite violence against a single person or specific group of people . but the german justice minister also called for harmonization of a wide range of other legal issues .
she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .
in addition , there are about one million divorces in the eu each year , and 20 percent of them involve people from two different european nations .

dw 's ute schaeffer says germany and europe urgently need to rethink their policy towards africa . ghana - the country that german president horst köhler just visited for four days - is for african standards a model state .
the country 's progress , however , is still governed by foreign factors , both old and new .
traditionally , african development has been influenced by donor nations in europe and the usa .
more recently , the emerging economies of india and china have become factors of influence as well .
chinese investments in ghana , for instance , have long exceeded those of great britain .
china is pushing its way into the west african state with all its might . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer globalization and rapid growth of the emerging economies have outrun the classical , european type of development policy .
africa is now part of a new international architecture . ghanaians living abroad transfer up to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to their homeland every year , making a significant contribution to its economic growth .
in ghana , like in other parts of africa , doors remain wide open for china and india . europe has so far missed on this development and that 's what the german president is concerned about .
the old development recipes are no longer effective .
europe 's outdated africa policy , in which everybody takes care of their own , personal africa , should be dead and buried .
how long does europe think it can keep its markets protected from african products ?
how long can europe keep believing that it can prevent migration from the neighboring continent using high walls , border controls or reception camps in the north african desert ? the european policy toward africa , which is shaped by fear and protectionism , is limiting africa 's potential that others have long noticed and taken advantage of .
europe should become more aware of its own interests in africa , including , for example , the issue of energy .
at the moment , africa produces 12 percent of the world 's crude oil supplies .
by 2010 , that amount will double .
the continent has over 50 million tons of natural gas at its disposal , which is one third of the deposits in the world . africa 's unused potentials include its manpower .
europe needs immigrants as well temporary foreign workers .
migrations - from africa and elsewhere - must be legalized and africans , too , must be allowed temporary entry to europe .
not the least because africa is a growing market that countries like china and india have long noticed and started exploiting .
africa is developing quickly .
ghana is a case in point . europe should not hand its neighbor continent over to china .
it is important to establish wide-ranging connections , social contacts and networks to get to know each other so that everybody can recognize their common interest .
the german president knows this , which is why he has launched his africa initiative .
with his continuing engagement and his third trip to africa , he wants to make sure that africa remains on the german government 's agenda . germany could set certain things in motion for africa , both in the eu and at the g8 summit .
this could happen in theory at least , since other topics - the constitutional process or relations to central asia - are seen as the more urgent priorities of the german eu presidency .
the german government , however , is planning to address the issues of african economic conditions and development at the g8 level .
is that the first sign that the old europe is waking up and beginning to see its own chances in africa ?

illegal migration is high on the agenda . one of the main topics being discussed by ministers during the two-day meeting is the growing problem of illegal migration from africa to europe . last year alone , about 30,000 illegal migrants from africa attempted to reach the shores of the eu 's southern member countries spain , portugal and italy .
frontex , the bloc 's border security agency which coordinates the national border patrols , was found to be largely inefficient to cope with the influx . eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini told reporters on the eve of the meeting that he would call on all 27 eu nations to show solidarity and continue to give their backing to frontex , which became operational in october 2005 . frattini said patrols had to be organized now to take advantage of the current slowdown in flows due to the winter weather and stormy seas , and before the expected upswing once the weather improves . " i will appeal to all ministers to provide concrete contributions by april , because otherwise it will be too late to face the year , " frattini said . race against time for eu efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many risk everything for the chance of a new life european interior ministers are expecting a new wave of migrants in the spring when favorable weather conditions provide a window of opportunity to make the hazardous journey to the canary islands and across the mediterranean sea . in a bid to combat the expected new influx of illegal migrants , the eu ministers are set to step up their national efforts to stem the flow .
they want to provide more helicopters , planes and boats to patrol the shores of the southern member countries .
for this to be more successful than previous attempts , new guidelines and cooperation networks need to be agreed upon . " we have to support one another , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is hosting the talks .
" that means if a member state is faced with a difficult situation , that member state should be able to count on support . " tackle problem at its source , says schäuble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants the underlying problems approached but schäuble added that the german eu presidency saw the fight against poverty in developing countries as the key to success . " what we have to offer them is increased development aid and better access to our domestic labor markers , " schäuble said .
" this applies to highly skilled workers , but not only .
if all the skilled workers were to come to us and those with fewer skills were to remain in the developing countries , we 'd simply end up with a brain drain debate and would n't do ourselves a favor in the long run . " as well as the migrant debate , the interior and justice ministers will discuss security issues .
germany 's schäuble is also leading a drive to improve national police forces ' cross-border cooperation with a view to more efficient transnational crime fighting within the eu .
he 's hoping to convince his counterparts that a central eu data base on crime is urgently needed . fighting crime and reforming laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries is in the mood for reforms meanwhile , german justice minister brigitte zypries , for her part , wants to promote tougher legislation against racially motivated crimes , including the denial of the holocaust .
a german proposal seeks to criminalize all racist declarations that incite violence against a single person or specific group of people . but the german justice minister also called for harmonization of a wide range of other legal issues .
she has picked european inheritance and family laws as ripe for reform . " within the european union , there are some 100,000 cross-border inheritance cases , " zypries said .
in addition , there are about one million divorces in the eu each year , and 20 percent of them involve people from two different european nations .
so , there 's a dire need to have clearer legislation as to how to deal with such transnational cases in the bloc . " the dresden meeting of eu interior and justice ministers is an informal one , so no immediate policy changes are expected .
it is hoped though that many of the proposals made in dresden will be turned into law later this year . hardy graupner / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , african officials discuss immigration ministers from more than 50 eu and african countries are expected to conclude a conference in the libyan capital tripoli on migration flows and development with a joint declaration on migration issues .

with his continuing engagement and his third trip to africa , he wants to make sure that africa remains on the german government 's agenda . germany could set certain things in motion for africa , both in the eu and at the g8 summit .
this could happen in theory at least , since other topics - the constitutional process or relations to central asia - are seen as the more urgent priorities of the german eu presidency .
the german government , however , is planning to address the issues of african economic conditions and development at the g8 level .
is that the first sign that the old europe is waking up and beginning to see its own chances in africa ?

" he said the plan would allow investigators from an eu nation for the first time to have access to a dna or fingerprint databank of crime suspects in all other eu member states .
the only prerequisite , schäuble said , would be that a formal investigation would first have to be opened . widening existing treaty schäuble 's plan is n't entirely new .
it touches upon an existing agreement called the " prüm treaty " on police cooperation which seven states have already signed . named after the western german town where it was signed in 2005 , it allows participating nations mutual and automatic access to dna and fingerprint records , as well as car registration information .
the treaty allows police to pursue fugitives across another eu state 's border in case of imminent danger to individuals .
it also allows joint police patrols . but the treaty is only operational in germany , austria and spain . " our aim is to create a modern police information network for more effective crime control throughout europe , " schäuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan will lead to more cross-border cooperation in the eu schäuble also pointed out that in the six weeks that the prüm system has been in operation , the sharing of information between germany and austria has led to 1,500 dna matches , including 32 in homicide cases and 23 in rape or sexual assault cases . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the treaty would achieve two seemingly contradictory goals - making sensitive data available to security authorities while protecting the privacy rights of eu citizens . schäuble added that the information database would be used by police forces , not national intelligence agencies . not everyone in favor the german minister said monday that most eu member states had backed the idea of enshrining the prüm treaty in eu law . " we have had a very broad consensus .
i am pleasantly surprised , " schäuble said . " dna is today the most effective means of solving crime , " said french regional development minister christian estrosi , who represented french interior minister nicolas sarkozy at the talks .
on an eu-wide level " we could solve thousands of crimes much more quickly , " he added . however eu members britain , czech republic , ireland and poland said they needed more time to think about the treaty for fear that it might be too expensive to update their existing databanks . all states need to agree for the treaty to become eu law .
the european commission will put forward a formal proposal next month . schäuble 's proposal was criticized monday by germany 's opposition free-market liberals , the fdp .
the debate among eu ministers in dresden showed " the low premium that is put on civil rights and data security in eu legal and interior policy , " said gisela piltz , fdp spokeswoman on security affairs . more cooperation with us ? schäuble also said he could n't rule out opening germany 's police databank containing dna and digital fingerprint information to the us . the minister , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said the issue was first raised by representatives of the us department of the interior in september last year in order to help in the hunt for terrorism suspects who could be hiding in germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany launches eu initiative to tackle right-wing extremism germany has put forward measures to help europe unite forces in the battle against the far-right .

the treaty allows police to pursue fugitives across another eu state 's border in case of imminent danger to individuals .

known as the mukhabarat , the intelligence organisation was believed to have tortured and murdered thousands of opponents of the regime .
the baath party official was taken into custody by us forces in april 2003 .
at the time , he was described as a presidential adviser with in-depth knowledge of the inner workings of saddam hussein 's regime .
barzan was a leading figure in the mukhabarat from the 1970s , later taking over as director .
a us official , speaking on the condition of anonymity at the time of his capture , said that during his time in the secret police , barzan had played a key role in the iraqi regime 's execution of opponents at home and assassinations abroad .
the us official said that barzan was also known for his ruthlessness and brutality in purging the iraqi military of anyone seen as disloyal .
targeted barzan became iraq 's representative to the united nations in geneva - including the un human rights committee - in 1989 .
he was in geneva for almost a decade , during which he is believed to have managed clandestine accounts for the iraqi president 's overseas fortune .
barzan was among the leadership figures that us forces targeted during the war .
in april 2003 , warplanes dropped six satellite-guided bombs on a building in the city of ramadi , west of baghdad , where he was thought to be .
despite falling out of favour with saddam hussein at one time , he was believed to have been a presidential adviser at the time of his capture .
during his trial , barzan was known for his angry outbursts in court and was ejected on several occasions .
correspondents said , however , that he had learned the ways of the court well and was effectively poking holes in the prosecution .
he was executed in baghdad on 15 january 2007 .

you may remember that we launched an appeal in december for volunteers for a new breakfast experiment : to see how easy it is to go green .
we were looking for a typical family who were prepared to make some tough choices , to reduce their carbon footprint .
we were deluged with e-mails - many of you , it seems , are gluttons for punishment .
after sifting through hundreds of volunteers , we chose the hawksworths .
will teenager lauren have to bin the fairy lights ?
they 've got five children , two cars - and a stonking electricity bill .
but can they change all that , with the help of breakfast 's team of experts and our presenter declan curry ?
this morning on breakfast , we met the hawksworths for the first time - and found out just how tough the coming year is going to be for them .
got comment ?
jump straight to our e-mail form how to work out your carbon footprint your carbon footprint is effectively your own personal contribution to global warming .
it 's the amount of extra carbon dioxide which you 're responsible for producing each year .
now , we all know that people produce only negligible amounts of carbon dioxide -lrb- each time we breathe out -rrb- . .. or will 15 year old alex have to unplug his xbox ?
but , every time you get in your car , switch on your central heating or take a flight abroad , you 're burning fuel - and that 's what produces the co2 .
you can get a general picture of your carbon footprint by going online , to websites such as carbon footprint or climate care -lrb- see links on the right hand side of this story -rrb- .
you 'll need to have your gas and electricity bills for the year to hand - and you 'll need to be honest about your car mileage and the number of aircraft journeys you make each year .
but your own carbon footprint may be even bigger than their calculator suggests .
the hawksworth 's personal footprint if , for instance , you have one of those very fashionable gas patio heaters , you 'll be producing as much carbon dioxide in two hours as a car will create in a day .
your carbon footprint will also be increased if you have a taste for out-of-season fruit and veg or fresh flowers in midwinter , flown in from africa .
and , if you happen to have an old-fashioned open coal fire in your front room - the most inefficient form of heating - you 'll need to take the amount of coal you use each year -lrb- in kg -rrb- double it and add it to your total carbon footprint .
shrinking your footprint an average british person has a carbon footprint of just under 11,000kg each year .
to halt global warming , scientists calculate that we need to reduce that - to around 2,500kg each year .
over the next year , we 'll be showing our guinea-pig family how they can go low-carb .
in the meantime , here are some small steps to get you started : change your electricity supplier - for one which specialises in renewable energy .
you wo n't notice any change - but the environment will insulate your home properly , as heating accounts for 70 % of our domestic energy use .
you do n't have to splash out on double glazing .
use thick curtains at your windows and lay your own insulation in the loft .
if you can bear to turn down the thermostat by one degree , you 'll save 300kg of co2 each year .
swap the car for a smaller model .
a bmw x5 produces twice as much carbon dioxide as a ford ka .
cut back on foreign air travel .
it 's not just the large amount of co2 which planes produce which is a problem here , it 's also the fact that they 're so high in the earth 's atmosphere .
if you want to calculate your exact carbon footprint , try the collins gem carbon counter -lrb- £ 4.99 -rrb- isbn : 978 0 00 724812 for advice on how to cut your own footprint , try the energy saving trust helpline : 0800 512 012 got a comment on our low carb experiment ?

it was he who imposed the death sentence on them .
according to the charges against him , it was just one of the show trials which he conducted that led to summary executions .
but when he later sat in a baghdad courtroom as an accused man - not in his erstwhile privileged position of judge - awad al-bandar 's lawyers argued that he was only enforcing iraqi law as it was at the time .
as such , the defence argued , he was only obeying orders .
but the court rejected this and ruled that his imposition of the death penalty in dujail was in fact an order of murder .
bandar was also accused of sentencing to death 35 teenagers - boys too young to be executed legally .
but he told the court : " i am a judge and my deep conscience would not allow me to sentence to death someone under the age of 20 " .
the iraqi tribunal did not believe him .
however , the united states-based organisation , human rights watch , has said it was deeply disturbed by what it called significant flaws in the case against him .
a spokesman said that the execution of bandar and his co-accused - however appalling their crimes - was cruel and inhuman punishment that will only drag what it called a deeply flawed process into even greater disrepute .

it was he who imposed the death sentence on them .
according to the charges against him , it was just one of the show trials which he conducted that led to summary executions .
but when he later sat in a baghdad courtroom as an accused man - not in his erstwhile privileged position of judge - awad al-bandar 's lawyers argued that he was only enforcing iraqi law as it was at the time .
as such , the defence argued , he was only obeying orders .
but the court rejected this and ruled that his imposition of the death penalty in dujail was in fact an order of murder .
bandar was also accused of sentencing to death 35 teenagers - boys too young to be executed legally .
but he told the court : " i am a judge and my deep conscience would not allow me to sentence to death someone under the age of 20 " .
the iraqi tribunal did not believe him .
however , the united states-based organisation , human rights watch , has said it was deeply disturbed by what it called significant flaws in the case against him .

a motion released by the sinn fein executive this weekend also includes support for the criminal justice system , the party taking places on the policing board and authorising sinn fein ministers to pledge their support for the forces of law and order .
so by any standards the extraordinary ard fheis -lrb- party conference -rrb- which will debate this motion on 28 january promises to be historic .
however , the conditions attached to sinn fein 's foray into backing the police still make the prospects for the election campaign due to begin in early february uncertain .
sinn fein officials are now scouring nationalist areas for suitable venues for large public meetings to put their case for such a dramatic change of policy .
this follows months if not years of more private discussions , preparing their own activists to think the unthinkable .
some prominent republicans have already vowed to oppose the sinn fein leadership should the assembly election proceed in the spring .
but any observer of gerry adams ' shrewd political calculations in the past will assume that the sinn fein president would not have embarked on this course unless he felt fairly sure that he could carry both the extraordinary ard fheis and the wider republican community .
however , even if mr adams chalks up a resounding victory on 28 january the course of events is unlikely to run smooth .
the motion to be debated gives the sinn fein leadership authority to implement the new policy in the context of " the re-establishment of the political institutions and confirmation that policing and justice powers will be transferred to these institutions " .
but dup politicians have said they will not move unless sinn fein first delivers on policing on the ground .
some , such as the mep jim allister , have argued that , even if republicans do deliver at the end of this month , 26 march is n't a credible testing period of their bona fides .
yet the sinn fein leadership shows no sign of dancing to mr allister 's tune .
ian paisley has consistently refused to give any guarantees on a timetable for the transfer of justice powers .
in his statement this weekend , gerry adams said it would be wrong " to allow the most negative elements of unionism a veto over republican and nationalist efforts to achieve the new beginning to policing promised in the good friday agreement " .
sinn fein he added for good measure " will not be paralysed by rejectionist elements of the dup " .
this does not appear to be code for the immediate implementation of sinn fein 's new policy in early february .
instead , if the dup does not respond positively , republicans are talking about pressing the governments to introduce some policing element to any new british-irish partnership arrangements which may emerge as a " plan b " .
a new sinn fein policy which has yet to be implemented could pose difficulties for the dup .
in such a scenario it 's hard to see the dup unequivocally committing to share power in their manifesto for the election due to take place in march .
if they do n't , downing street may wonder whether it is worth pushing ahead with an election which could be marred by confusion and negativity .
let 's be clear .
sinn fein 's decision to press ahead with their policing conference is far more positive for the political process than if republicans had taken their motion off the table .
but for all the welcomes for the initiative from premiers and party leaders , the ard fheis could still be the precursor to a period of political turmoil .

some , such as the mep jim allister , have argued that , even if republicans do deliver at the end of this month , 26 march is n't a credible testing period of their bona fides .
gerry adams says the dup must not have a veto over republicans yet the sinn fein leadership shows no sign of dancing to mr allister 's tune .
ian paisley has consistently refused to give any guarantees on a timetable for the transfer of justice powers .
in his statement this weekend , gerry adams said it would be wrong " to allow the most negative elements of unionism a veto over republican and nationalist efforts to achieve the new beginning to policing promised in the good friday agreement " .
sinn fein he added for good measure " will not be paralysed by rejectionist elements of the dup " .
this does not appear to be code for the immediate implementation of sinn fein 's new policy in early february .
instead , if the dup does not respond positively , republicans are talking about pressing the governments to introduce some policing element to any new british-irish partnership arrangements which may emerge as a " plan b " .
a new sinn fein policy which has yet to be implemented could pose difficulties for the dup .
in such a scenario it 's hard to see the dup unequivocally committing to share power in their manifesto for the election due to take place in march .
if they do n't , downing street may wonder whether it is worth pushing ahead with an election which could be marred by confusion and negativity .
let 's be clear .
sinn fein 's decision to press ahead with their policing conference is far more positive for the political process than if republicans had taken their motion off the table .
but for all the welcomes for the initiative from premiers and party leaders , the ard fheis could still be the precursor to a period of political turmoil .
