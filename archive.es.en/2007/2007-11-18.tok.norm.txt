a successful take-over by a chinese conglomerate made a success story out of a german sewing machine company . when dürkopp adler 's 1,750 employees heard in 2005 that their sewing machine company had been bought out by the chinese shang-gong group -lrb- sgsb -rrb- , many feared for their jobs .
their alarm was founded on other cases of chinese conglomerates buying up long-standing german companies - and gutting them to make a nice profit . but the 150-year-old sewing machine maker not had to slash jobs , and it 's been in the black since the take-over for the first time in years . " the number of employees at dürkopp adler has increased worldwide by around 50 , " said reinhard kottmann , the company 's head of accounting and controlling . production in the western city of bielefeld has n't changed and neither has the management , except for several chinese representatives on the board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much has changed at the dürkopp adler headquarters in bielefeld subsidiary kept afloat following the acquisition , sgsb pumped money into technological innovation at dürkopp adler .
the financial support was desperately needed for the company to maintain its technological edge on the global playing field . a massive 3.5-million euro -lrb- $ 5.1-million -rrb- order from the automotive branch - for 800 industrial sewing machines to make car seats - helped keep the company afloat .
it also made it clear that the chinese were capable of doing business , and not just buying up shares . landmark case leaves long-lasting fears despite the fact that dürkopp adler 's stock price has doubled since the beginning of 2006 , recently meeting its all-time high , not all concerns have been quelled as memories of other foreign investment companies taking over german firms remain . the taiwanese company benq 's acquisition of siemens ' mobile phone division in 2005 .
after less than a year , benq cut off funds , declared bankruptcy and laid-off thousands of former siemens employees . kottmann admitted that he could n't exclude the possibility of a similar outcome at dürkopp adler .
however , there is one significant difference between the two formerly german companies : benq was n't able to dam the tide of ever-swelling loss , while sgsb has brought its struggling subsidiary into the black . acquisition was a win-win deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's take-over of siemens ' mobile phone division did n't go well indeed , dürkopp adler is no stranger to change .
within 30 years of its founding in bielefeld in 1860 , the " adler " name had become world-famous .
company founders tried their luck in a variety of branches - from typewriters to bicycles to cars - and finally settled on industrial sewing machines .
near the end of the 1970s , the company relocated production abroad as the sector struggled to keep its head above water . it was the reputable adler name and german technology that the shang-gong group needed to break out of the discount sector . " by becoming the majority stockholder , we gained dürkopp adler 's brand advantage and development capabilities , " said chinese management board member zheng ying . while bielefeld serves as a less expensive research center for the shang-gong group , shanghai is adler 's financial backer , market outlet and gateway into other asian countries . erning zhu / yanyan han -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the union is demanding a 31 percent pay raise and a contact separate from other rail workers . deutsche bahn has offered to increase pay by up to 10 percent in exchange for longer working hours , but opposes giving the gdl its own contract , saying it would encourage small numbers other professionals to exploit their economic leverage to secure excessive raises . european consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european economy could suffer if raw materials are delivered to factories despite media reports over the weekend that the bahn was preparing a new contract , gdl deputy chairman claus weselsky told the german news agency dpa he was not aware of any higher offer yet . the european union said it hoped a deal would be reached quickly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 18.11.2007 chinese take-over turns around german company großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zheng ying has become the chinese head of dürkopp adler while the word " acquisition " can be enough to make an employee 's blood run cold .
a successful take-over by a chinese conglomerate made a success story out of a german sewing machine company . when dürkopp adler 's 1,750 employees heard in 2005 that their sewing machine company had been bought out by the chinese shang-gong group -lrb- sgsb -rrb- , many feared for their jobs .
their alarm was founded on other cases of chinese conglomerates buying up long-standing german companies - and gutting them to make a nice profit . but the 150-year-old sewing machine maker not had to slash jobs , and it 's been in the black since the take-over for the first time in years . " the number of employees at dürkopp adler has increased worldwide by around 50 , " said reinhard kottmann , the company 's head of accounting and controlling . production in the western city of bielefeld has n't changed and neither has the management , except for several chinese representatives on the board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much has changed at the dürkopp adler headquarters in bielefeld subsidiary kept afloat following the acquisition , sgsb pumped money into technological innovation at dürkopp adler .
the financial support was desperately needed for the company to maintain its technological edge on the global playing field . a massive 3.5-million euro -lrb- $ 5.1-million -rrb- order from the automotive branch - for 800 industrial sewing machines to make car seats - helped keep the company afloat .
it also made it clear that the chinese were capable of doing business , and not just buying up shares . landmark case leaves long-lasting fears despite the fact that dürkopp adler 's stock price has doubled since the beginning of 2006 , recently meeting its all-time high , not all concerns have been quelled as memories of other foreign investment companies taking over german firms remain . the taiwanese company benq 's acquisition of siemens ' mobile phone division in 2005 .
after less than a year , benq cut off funds , declared bankruptcy and laid-off thousands of former siemens employees . kottmann admitted that he could n't exclude the possibility of a similar outcome at dürkopp adler .
however , there is one significant difference between the two formerly german companies : benq was n't able to dam the tide of ever-swelling loss , while sgsb has brought its struggling subsidiary into the black . acquisition was a win-win deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's take-over of siemens ' mobile phone division did n't go well indeed , dürkopp adler is no stranger to change .
within 30 years of its founding in bielefeld in 1860 , the " adler " name had become world-famous .
company founders tried their luck in a variety of branches - from typewriters to bicycles to cars - and finally settled on industrial sewing machines .
near the end of the 1970s , the company relocated production abroad as the sector struggled to keep its head above water . it was the reputable adler name and german technology that the shang-gong group needed to break out of the discount sector . " by becoming the majority stockholder , we gained dürkopp adler 's brand advantage and development capabilities , " said chinese management board member zheng ying . while bielefeld serves as a less expensive research center for the shang-gong group , shanghai is adler 's financial backer , market outlet and gateway into other asian countries . erning zhu / yanyan han -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 've been so successful , that they 've won a major prize and postponed their studies . martin höfeler and anton jurina have a dream : to grow a company that employs methods that are sound for both the environment and their social conscience . " we want to create unique fashion that distinguishes itself from ' the cheaper , the better ' motto of mass production , " said höfeler . this past spring , the two students founded the social fashion company in cologne and , with it , the " armedangels " label that offers clothing manufactured " in ethically and ecologically acceptable ways , " höfeler said . promoting sustainability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armedangels design went through hundreds of drafts before it was finalized that means working with suppliers who do not use child labor and who offer their employees fair wages and agreeable working hours .
it also means that only pesticide-free cotton and as few chemicals as possible are used in the clothing 's production . other companies , such as american apparel , levi 's , nike and the swedish chain h & m have discovered that " eco-clothing " sells .
likewise , organic cosmetics companies are booming , and ever more firms are selling products based on fair-trade policies . but höfeler and jurina , aged 25 and 28 respectively , said their company distinguishes itself from all the rest : a portion of their profits is donated directly to charity organizations . right now , the armedangels line is made up of street wear-style t-shirts - short and long-sleeved , and tank tops - that range in price from 29 to 50 euros -lrb- $ 43 to $ 74 -rrb- .
for every shirt sold , armedangels passes on 3.33 euros in aid to schools and hospitals in bolivia . certified fair trade with chic design to ensure armedangels lives up to the students ' sustainability claim , it only works with socially responsible companies that have fair-trade labels and certificates . höfeler and jurina currently import cotton from peru and have t-shirts sewn on the island of mauritius , but intend to switch to a cotton producer in india with a good fair-trade reputation . germany simply is n't a cotton-producing country , höfeler pointed out , lamenting the environmental impact of long transportation routes . tired of common capitalist slogan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pesticides used on cotton plants do n't always wash out of clothing the duo was taking a corporate management class together when they concocted the armedangels idea . " we were tired of hearing the traditional capitalist motto of ' maximizing profits ' every time we went to a business class , " said höfeler , adding that he had always wanted to start his own company . the pair had spent enough time doing internships in large companies to realize they did not want to be cogs in what they called the capitalist machine .
instead , they decided to capitalize on the socially conscious market segment - with success . a conscientious idea that paid off höfeler and jurina 's social fashion company was awarded the " young entrepreneur " prize from the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche for finding the right combination of this eclectic mix of interests .
as part of the honor , the company also received 250,000 euros to spend on marketing , business and legal advice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-shirts are the only items on armedangels ' racks - for now " armedangels had an enthusiastic team and absolutely convincing business idea that fits perfectly into the current trend of sustainable fashion and environmental consciousness , " said jochen mai , prize coordinator at wirtschaftswoche , which devoted its september cover to the notion that morals lead to profits . höfeler and jurina were also successful in another way : they convinced a few " business angels " - older , established business people willing to invest in young entrepreneurs - to give them start-up capital .
the two have been working so much that they postponed their studies in business and law . höfeler and jurina plan to expand armedangels , which is available exclusively on the internet . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their alarm was founded on other cases of chinese conglomerates buying up long-standing german companies - and gutting them to make a nice profit . but the 150-year-old sewing machine maker not had to slash jobs , and it 's been in the black since the take-over for the first time in years . " the number of employees at dürkopp adler has increased worldwide by around 50 , " said reinhard kottmann , the company 's head of accounting and controlling . production in the western city of bielefeld has n't changed and neither has the management , except for several chinese representatives on the board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much has changed at the dürkopp adler headquarters in bielefeld subsidiary kept afloat following the acquisition , sgsb pumped money into technological innovation at dürkopp adler .

it also made it clear that the chinese were capable of doing business , and not just buying up shares . landmark case leaves long-lasting fears despite the fact that dürkopp adler 's stock price has doubled since the beginning of 2006 , recently meeting its all-time high , not all concerns have been quelled as memories of other foreign investment companies taking over german firms remain . the taiwanese company benq 's acquisition of siemens ' mobile phone division in 2005 .
after less than a year , benq cut off funds , declared bankruptcy and laid-off thousands of former siemens employees . kottmann admitted that he could n't exclude the possibility of a similar outcome at dürkopp adler .
however , there is one significant difference between the two formerly german companies : benq was n't able to dam the tide of ever-swelling loss , while sgsb has brought its struggling subsidiary into the black . acquisition was a win-win deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's take-over of siemens ' mobile phone division did n't go well indeed , dürkopp adler is no stranger to change .

" the citizens of kosovo have sent a message to the world that we are a democratic country and society . " with votes from 90 percent of polling stations counted , the democracy in action group said thaci 's pdk was leading with 34 percent , beating the once-dominant democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- into second place with 22 percent , reuters reported . thaci said the polls showed the province was ready for independence from serbia - a view that regularly receives high support among kosovo 's majority ethnic albanian population . status talks to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pdk appears set to form a coalition government with at least one other party the vote was held just days before an important set of negotiations in brussels to decide the future status of the southern serbian province , whose independence belgrade 's fiercely opposes .
chances of a breakthrough , however , are slim . " i do n't think anyone is that hopeful of a breakthrough on tuesday , " one diplomat told reuters , adding that eu members would in try to overcome national differences on whether to recognize any future kosovo independence claim . ldk , the largest party in the province , formed 18 years ago by the late creator of the kosovo albanian independence movement ibrahim rugova , was punished by voters and collected only 22 percent of the votes . ldk is , however , expected to remain in power as the junior partner in a grand coalition , as albanian leaders will want to forge a strong government quickly in time for the end of a round of un-sponsored talks on kosovo 's status with serbia on dec .

" turnout was low because people are depressed , " said analyst berat buzhala of the daily kosovo express .
" this is about the economic situation - no water , no electricity , no jobs . " ethnic serb boycott saturday 's poll , which included voting for 30 municipal assemblies and mayors , was also marked by the comprehensive boycott by the provinces 120,000 ethnic serbs .
nearly all of them followed belgrade 's orders and kept away from polling stations .
many fear they would be driven out of an independent kosovo . the boycott , however , meant the serbs lost control over the five municipalities with mixed population in which they were a majority .
the situation in the exclusively-serb municipalities is unclear . by comparison , in 2001 serbs had won 11.3 percent of the votes and , with seats guaranteed for minorities , they had 22 representatives .
in the upcoming assembly they may take only the 10 seats reserved for them , belgrade analysts said . saturday 's elections were the third since a un administration and a nato peacekeeping force assumed control over kosovo in mid-1999 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a successful take-over by a chinese conglomerate made a success story out of a german sewing machine company . when dürkopp adler 's 1,750 employees heard in 2005 that their sewing machine company had been bought out by the chinese shang-gong group -lrb- sgsb -rrb- , many feared for their jobs .
their alarm was founded on other cases of chinese conglomerates buying up long-standing german companies - and gutting them to make a nice profit . but the 150-year-old sewing machine maker not had to slash jobs , and it 's been in the black since the take-over for the first time in years . " the number of employees at dürkopp adler has increased worldwide by around 50 , " said reinhard kottmann , the company 's head of accounting and controlling . production in the western city of bielefeld has n't changed and neither has the management , except for several chinese representatives on the board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much has changed at the dürkopp adler headquarters in bielefeld subsidiary kept afloat following the acquisition , sgsb pumped money into technological innovation at dürkopp adler .
the financial support was desperately needed for the company to maintain its technological edge on the global playing field . a massive 3.5-million euro -lrb- $ 5.1-million -rrb- order from the automotive branch - for 800 industrial sewing machines to make car seats - helped keep the company afloat .
it also made it clear that the chinese were capable of doing business , and not just buying up shares . landmark case leaves long-lasting fears despite the fact that dürkopp adler 's stock price has doubled since the beginning of 2006 , recently meeting its all-time high , not all concerns have been quelled as memories of other foreign investment companies taking over german firms remain . the taiwanese company benq 's acquisition of siemens ' mobile phone division in 2005 .
after less than a year , benq cut off funds , declared bankruptcy and laid-off thousands of former siemens employees . kottmann admitted that he could n't exclude the possibility of a similar outcome at dürkopp adler .
however , there is one significant difference between the two formerly german companies : benq was n't able to dam the tide of ever-swelling loss , while sgsb has brought its struggling subsidiary into the black . acquisition was a win-win deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's take-over of siemens ' mobile phone division did n't go well indeed , dürkopp adler is no stranger to change .
within 30 years of its founding in bielefeld in 1860 , the " adler " name had become world-famous .
company founders tried their luck in a variety of branches - from typewriters to bicycles to cars - and finally settled on industrial sewing machines .
near the end of the 1970s , the company relocated production abroad as the sector struggled to keep its head above water . it was the reputable adler name and german technology that the shang-gong group needed to break out of the discount sector .

germany are up against wales in frankfurt on wednesday while the czech republic play cyprus in the concluding qualifying games . better concentration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw said germany were in better balance for the match against cyprus " all the goals were well worked and there was good movement from lukas on the -lsb- left -rsb- side , " germany coach joachim löw said .
" he was involved in all four goals .
he moved well and was able to use the space .
he is a top-class footballer .
it is a good alternative for us . " we began with the concentration we did n't have against czech republic , " löw added .
" if we keep the tempo up we can combine well .
if we take the pace off we make mistakes .

" löw could call on his 2006 world cup back four of arne friedrich , christoph metzelder , per mertesacker and philipp lahm in front of jens lehmann , earning his 50th cap in the german goal . but it was a new-look midfield , with löw having to replace the injured quartet of michael ballack , bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
podolski was given an attacking left-sided midfield role alongside hitzlsperger , fritz and piotr trochowski , with stuttgart 's mario gomez partnering klose up front . bildunterschrift : germany relived scenes some thought disappeared after the loss to the czech republic the selection immediately paid off when podolski set up the first goal after just 75 seconds when he bustled past three cyprus defenders along the byline to cross for fritz to score with a diving header . podolski started the move which led to werder bremen 's fritz providing the pass for miroslav klose to thread the ball through two cyprus defenders for a second in the 20th minute . germany booked their ticket for the euro 2008 last month before the setback of an embarrassing 3-0 home defeat against the czech republic . slight step forward but there were no signs of a similar slip-up , with the germans , who had drawn 1-1 with cyprus in nicosia a year ago , threatening to score with almost every attack . podolski increased the lead eight minutes after the break when he steered in a low cross from the right from bayern munich team-mate klose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been having trouble getting started at bayern munich goalkeeper antonis georgallidis could only parry podolski 's close-range shot into the roof of the net , but the ' keeper did well three minutes late to turn a podolski shot over the bar . however there was no stopping podolski eight minutes from time when he raced past two defenders into the area to send in a cross which hitzlsperger turned into the net from almost point-blank range to complete the scoring . " i am trying to show what i can do and i think it worked out well said podolski , who has struggled this season to get in the bayern munich side .

18 . the strike , which was the largest in deutsche bahn history , was called by the gdl , a small union , seeking a better deal for drivers than contracts previously accepted by two larger railways unions which also have clerical and engineering members . the gdl 's campaign has also angered the head germany 's social democratic party , part of chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition . threat to negotiating system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking train drivers were n't the only ones left out in the cold kurt beck , the spd chairman , told the paper that the strike was a threat to germany 's pay-bargaining system , in which unions agree to negotiate in blocs . " if it came about that every enterprise had a range of different collective labor contracts , the outcome would be great insecurity and instability , " he said . the drivers ' union , which has warned that its next strike may have no time limit , says it will not resume talks unless the railways company , deutsche bahn , speaks to the gdl alone and excludes the other two unions from the accord . it insisted sunday it would also not return to the negotiating table unless bahn raised its pay offer to drivers .
the union is demanding a 31 percent pay raise and a contact separate from other rail workers . deutsche bahn has offered to increase pay by up to 10 percent in exchange for longer working hours , but opposes giving the gdl its own contract , saying it would encourage small numbers other professionals to exploit their economic leverage to secure excessive raises . european consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european economy could suffer if raw materials are delivered to factories despite media reports over the weekend that the bahn was preparing a new contract , gdl deputy chairman claus weselsky told the german news agency dpa he was not aware of any higher offer yet . the european union said it hoped a deal would be reached quickly .
as france continues to experience a nationwide rail strike , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot told the bild am sonntag a long walk-outs could have serious economic consequences not only for all of europe . " -lsb- strikes -rsb- could damage the economy , not just in germany and france , but also in neighboring countries , " he said .

they 've been so successful , that they 've won a major prize and postponed their studies . martin höfeler and anton jurina have a dream : to grow a company that employs methods that are sound for both the environment and their social conscience . " we want to create unique fashion that distinguishes itself from ' the cheaper , the better ' motto of mass production , " said höfeler . this past spring , the two students founded the social fashion company in cologne and , with it , the " armedangels " label that offers clothing manufactured " in ethically and ecologically acceptable ways , " höfeler said . promoting sustainability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armedangels design went through hundreds of drafts before it was finalized that means working with suppliers who do not use child labor and who offer their employees fair wages and agreeable working hours .
it also means that only pesticide-free cotton and as few chemicals as possible are used in the clothing 's production . other companies , such as american apparel , levi 's , nike and the swedish chain h & m have discovered that " eco-clothing " sells .
likewise , organic cosmetics companies are booming , and ever more firms are selling products based on fair-trade policies . but höfeler and jurina , aged 25 and 28 respectively , said their company distinguishes itself from all the rest : a portion of their profits is donated directly to charity organizations . right now , the armedangels line is made up of street wear-style t-shirts - short and long-sleeved , and tank tops - that range in price from 29 to 50 euros -lrb- $ 43 to $ 74 -rrb- .
for every shirt sold , armedangels passes on 3.33 euros in aid to schools and hospitals in bolivia . certified fair trade with chic design to ensure armedangels lives up to the students ' sustainability claim , it only works with socially responsible companies that have fair-trade labels and certificates . höfeler and jurina currently import cotton from peru and have t-shirts sewn on the island of mauritius , but intend to switch to a cotton producer in india with a good fair-trade reputation . germany simply is n't a cotton-producing country , höfeler pointed out , lamenting the environmental impact of long transportation routes . tired of common capitalist slogan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pesticides used on cotton plants do n't always wash out of clothing the duo was taking a corporate management class together when they concocted the armedangels idea . " we were tired of hearing the traditional capitalist motto of ' maximizing profits ' every time we went to a business class , " said höfeler , adding that he had always wanted to start his own company . the pair had spent enough time doing internships in large companies to realize they did not want to be cogs in what they called the capitalist machine .
instead , they decided to capitalize on the socially conscious market segment - with success . a conscientious idea that paid off höfeler and jurina 's social fashion company was awarded the " young entrepreneur " prize from the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche for finding the right combination of this eclectic mix of interests .
as part of the honor , the company also received 250,000 euros to spend on marketing , business and legal advice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-shirts are the only items on armedangels ' racks - for now " armedangels had an enthusiastic team and absolutely convincing business idea that fits perfectly into the current trend of sustainable fashion and environmental consciousness , " said jochen mai , prize coordinator at wirtschaftswoche , which devoted its september cover to the notion that morals lead to profits . höfeler and jurina were also successful in another way : they convinced a few " business angels " - older , established business people willing to invest in young entrepreneurs - to give them start-up capital .
the two have been working so much that they postponed their studies in business and law . höfeler and jurina plan to expand armedangels , which is available exclusively on the internet . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 . the strike , which was the largest in deutsche bahn history , was called by the gdl , a small union , seeking a better deal for drivers than contracts previously accepted by two larger railways unions which also have clerical and engineering members . the gdl 's campaign has also angered the head germany 's social democratic party , part of chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition . threat to negotiating system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking train drivers were n't the only ones left out in the cold kurt beck , the spd chairman , told the paper that the strike was a threat to germany 's pay-bargaining system , in which unions agree to negotiate in blocs . " if it came about that every enterprise had a range of different collective labor contracts , the outcome would be great insecurity and instability , " he said . the drivers ' union , which has warned that its next strike may have no time limit , says it will not resume talks unless the railways company , deutsche bahn , speaks to the gdl alone and excludes the other two unions from the accord . it insisted sunday it would also not return to the negotiating table unless bahn raised its pay offer to drivers .
the union is demanding a 31 percent pay raise and a contact separate from other rail workers . deutsche bahn has offered to increase pay by up to 10 percent in exchange for longer working hours , but opposes giving the gdl its own contract , saying it would encourage small numbers other professionals to exploit their economic leverage to secure excessive raises . european consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european economy could suffer if raw materials are delivered to factories despite media reports over the weekend that the bahn was preparing a new contract , gdl deputy chairman claus weselsky told the german news agency dpa he was not aware of any higher offer yet . the european union said it hoped a deal would be reached quickly .
as france continues to experience a nationwide rail strike , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot told the bild am sonntag a long walk-outs could have serious economic consequences not only for all of europe . " -lsb- strikes -rsb- could damage the economy , not just in germany and france , but also in neighboring countries , " he said .
" i hope the two sides reach a deal via quick and fair negotiations - without waiting for the state to intervene . " gdl has set bahn an ultimatum to file a better offer by the end of monday . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

podolski was given an attacking left-sided midfield role alongside hitzlsperger , fritz and piotr trochowski , with stuttgart 's mario gomez partnering klose up front . bildunterschrift : germany relived scenes some thought disappeared after the loss to the czech republic the selection immediately paid off when podolski set up the first goal after just 75 seconds when he bustled past three cyprus defenders along the byline to cross for fritz to score with a diving header . podolski started the move which led to werder bremen 's fritz providing the pass for miroslav klose to thread the ball through two cyprus defenders for a second in the 20th minute . germany booked their ticket for the euro 2008 last month before the setback of an embarrassing 3-0 home defeat against the czech republic . slight step forward but there were no signs of a similar slip-up , with the germans , who had drawn 1-1 with cyprus in nicosia a year ago , threatening to score with almost every attack . podolski increased the lead eight minutes after the break when he steered in a low cross from the right from bayern munich team-mate klose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been having trouble getting started at bayern munich goalkeeper antonis georgallidis could only parry podolski 's close-range shot into the roof of the net , but the ' keeper did well three minutes late to turn a podolski shot over the bar . however there was no stopping podolski eight minutes from time when he raced past two defenders into the area to send in a cross which hitzlsperger turned into the net from almost point-blank range to complete the scoring . " i am trying to show what i can do and i think it worked out well said podolski , who has struggled this season to get in the bayern munich side .
" it was a small step forward but i have to carry on working on my game .
then i can manage to have games like this one , but it should n't be over-rated . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 've been so successful , that they 've won a major prize and postponed their studies . martin höfeler and anton jurina have a dream : to grow a company that employs methods that are sound for both the environment and their social conscience . " we want to create unique fashion that distinguishes itself from ' the cheaper , the better ' motto of mass production , " said höfeler . this past spring , the two students founded the social fashion company in cologne and , with it , the " armedangels " label that offers clothing manufactured " in ethically and ecologically acceptable ways , " höfeler said . promoting sustainability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armedangels design went through hundreds of drafts before it was finalized that means working with suppliers who do not use child labor and who offer their employees fair wages and agreeable working hours .
it also means that only pesticide-free cotton and as few chemicals as possible are used in the clothing 's production . other companies , such as american apparel , levi 's , nike and the swedish chain h & m have discovered that " eco-clothing " sells .
likewise , organic cosmetics companies are booming , and ever more firms are selling products based on fair-trade policies . but höfeler and jurina , aged 25 and 28 respectively , said their company distinguishes itself from all the rest : a portion of their profits is donated directly to charity organizations . right now , the armedangels line is made up of street wear-style t-shirts - short and long-sleeved , and tank tops - that range in price from 29 to 50 euros -lrb- $ 43 to $ 74 -rrb- .
for every shirt sold , armedangels passes on 3.33 euros in aid to schools and hospitals in bolivia . certified fair trade with chic design to ensure armedangels lives up to the students ' sustainability claim , it only works with socially responsible companies that have fair-trade labels and certificates . höfeler and jurina currently import cotton from peru and have t-shirts sewn on the island of mauritius , but intend to switch to a cotton producer in india with a good fair-trade reputation . germany simply is n't a cotton-producing country , höfeler pointed out , lamenting the environmental impact of long transportation routes . tired of common capitalist slogan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pesticides used on cotton plants do n't always wash out of clothing the duo was taking a corporate management class together when they concocted the armedangels idea . " we were tired of hearing the traditional capitalist motto of ' maximizing profits ' every time we went to a business class , " said höfeler , adding that he had always wanted to start his own company . the pair had spent enough time doing internships in large companies to realize they did not want to be cogs in what they called the capitalist machine .
instead , they decided to capitalize on the socially conscious market segment - with success . a conscientious idea that paid off höfeler and jurina 's social fashion company was awarded the " young entrepreneur " prize from the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche for finding the right combination of this eclectic mix of interests .
as part of the honor , the company also received 250,000 euros to spend on marketing , business and legal advice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-shirts are the only items on armedangels ' racks - for now " armedangels had an enthusiastic team and absolutely convincing business idea that fits perfectly into the current trend of sustainable fashion and environmental consciousness , " said jochen mai , prize coordinator at wirtschaftswoche , which devoted its september cover to the notion that morals lead to profits . höfeler and jurina were also successful in another way : they convinced a few " business angels " - older , established business people willing to invest in young entrepreneurs - to give them start-up capital .
the two have been working so much that they postponed their studies in business and law . höfeler and jurina plan to expand armedangels , which is available exclusively on the internet . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany are up against wales in frankfurt on wednesday while the czech republic play cyprus in the concluding qualifying games . better concentration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw said germany were in better balance for the match against cyprus " all the goals were well worked and there was good movement from lukas on the -lsb- left -rsb- side , " germany coach joachim löw said .
" he was involved in all four goals .
he moved well and was able to use the space .
he is a top-class footballer .
it is a good alternative for us . " we began with the concentration we did n't have against czech republic , " löw added .
" if we keep the tempo up we can combine well .
if we take the pace off we make mistakes .
all in all we can go into next year with a very positive feeling . " löw could call on his 2006 world cup back four of arne friedrich , christoph metzelder , per mertesacker and philipp lahm in front of jens lehmann , earning his 50th cap in the german goal . but it was a new-look midfield , with löw having to replace the injured quartet of michael ballack , bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
podolski was given an attacking left-sided midfield role alongside hitzlsperger , fritz and piotr trochowski , with stuttgart 's mario gomez partnering klose up front . bildunterschrift : germany relived scenes some thought disappeared after the loss to the czech republic the selection immediately paid off when podolski set up the first goal after just 75 seconds when he bustled past three cyprus defenders along the byline to cross for fritz to score with a diving header . podolski started the move which led to werder bremen 's fritz providing the pass for miroslav klose to thread the ball through two cyprus defenders for a second in the 20th minute . germany booked their ticket for the euro 2008 last month before the setback of an embarrassing 3-0 home defeat against the czech republic . slight step forward but there were no signs of a similar slip-up , with the germans , who had drawn 1-1 with cyprus in nicosia a year ago , threatening to score with almost every attack . podolski increased the lead eight minutes after the break when he steered in a low cross from the right from bayern munich team-mate klose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been having trouble getting started at bayern munich goalkeeper antonis georgallidis could only parry podolski 's close-range shot into the roof of the net , but the ' keeper did well three minutes late to turn a podolski shot over the bar . however there was no stopping podolski eight minutes from time when he raced past two defenders into the area to send in a cross which hitzlsperger turned into the net from almost point-blank range to complete the scoring . " i am trying to show what i can do and i think it worked out well said podolski , who has struggled this season to get in the bayern munich side .
" it was a small step forward but i have to carry on working on my game .
then i can manage to have games like this one , but it should n't be over-rated . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" turnout was low because people are depressed , " said analyst berat buzhala of the daily kosovo express .
" this is about the economic situation - no water , no electricity , no jobs . " ethnic serb boycott saturday 's poll , which included voting for 30 municipal assemblies and mayors , was also marked by the comprehensive boycott by the provinces 120,000 ethnic serbs .
nearly all of them followed belgrade 's orders and kept away from polling stations .
many fear they would be driven out of an independent kosovo . the boycott , however , meant the serbs lost control over the five municipalities with mixed population in which they were a majority .
the situation in the exclusively-serb municipalities is unclear . by comparison , in 2001 serbs had won 11.3 percent of the votes and , with seats guaranteed for minorities , they had 22 representatives .
in the upcoming assembly they may take only the 10 seats reserved for them , belgrade analysts said . saturday 's elections were the third since a un administration and a nato peacekeeping force assumed control over kosovo in mid-1999 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany are up against wales in frankfurt on wednesday while the czech republic play cyprus in the concluding qualifying games . better concentration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw said germany were in better balance for the match against cyprus " all the goals were well worked and there was good movement from lukas on the -lsb- left -rsb- side , " germany coach joachim löw said .
" he was involved in all four goals .
he moved well and was able to use the space .
he is a top-class footballer .
it is a good alternative for us . " we began with the concentration we did n't have against czech republic , " löw added .
" if we keep the tempo up we can combine well .
if we take the pace off we make mistakes .
all in all we can go into next year with a very positive feeling . " löw could call on his 2006 world cup back four of arne friedrich , christoph metzelder , per mertesacker and philipp lahm in front of jens lehmann , earning his 50th cap in the german goal . but it was a new-look midfield , with löw having to replace the injured quartet of michael ballack , bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
podolski was given an attacking left-sided midfield role alongside hitzlsperger , fritz and piotr trochowski , with stuttgart 's mario gomez partnering klose up front . bildunterschrift : germany relived scenes some thought disappeared after the loss to the czech republic the selection immediately paid off when podolski set up the first goal after just 75 seconds when he bustled past three cyprus defenders along the byline to cross for fritz to score with a diving header . podolski started the move which led to werder bremen 's fritz providing the pass for miroslav klose to thread the ball through two cyprus defenders for a second in the 20th minute . germany booked their ticket for the euro 2008 last month before the setback of an embarrassing 3-0 home defeat against the czech republic . slight step forward but there were no signs of a similar slip-up , with the germans , who had drawn 1-1 with cyprus in nicosia a year ago , threatening to score with almost every attack . podolski increased the lead eight minutes after the break when he steered in a low cross from the right from bayern munich team-mate klose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been having trouble getting started at bayern munich goalkeeper antonis georgallidis could only parry podolski 's close-range shot into the roof of the net , but the ' keeper did well three minutes late to turn a podolski shot over the bar . however there was no stopping podolski eight minutes from time when he raced past two defenders into the area to send in a cross which hitzlsperger turned into the net from almost point-blank range to complete the scoring . " i am trying to show what i can do and i think it worked out well said podolski , who has struggled this season to get in the bayern munich side .
" it was a small step forward but i have to carry on working on my game .
then i can manage to have games like this one , but it should n't be over-rated . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a successful take-over by a chinese conglomerate made a success story out of a german sewing machine company . when dürkopp adler 's 1,750 employees heard in 2005 that their sewing machine company had been bought out by the chinese shang-gong group -lrb- sgsb -rrb- , many feared for their jobs .
their alarm was founded on other cases of chinese conglomerates buying up long-standing german companies - and gutting them to make a nice profit . but the 150-year-old sewing machine maker not had to slash jobs , and it 's been in the black since the take-over for the first time in years . " the number of employees at dürkopp adler has increased worldwide by around 50 , " said reinhard kottmann , the company 's head of accounting and controlling . production in the western city of bielefeld has n't changed and neither has the management , except for several chinese representatives on the board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much has changed at the dürkopp adler headquarters in bielefeld subsidiary kept afloat following the acquisition , sgsb pumped money into technological innovation at dürkopp adler .
the financial support was desperately needed for the company to maintain its technological edge on the global playing field . a massive 3.5-million euro -lrb- $ 5.1-million -rrb- order from the automotive branch - for 800 industrial sewing machines to make car seats - helped keep the company afloat .
it also made it clear that the chinese were capable of doing business , and not just buying up shares . landmark case leaves long-lasting fears despite the fact that dürkopp adler 's stock price has doubled since the beginning of 2006 , recently meeting its all-time high , not all concerns have been quelled as memories of other foreign investment companies taking over german firms remain . the taiwanese company benq 's acquisition of siemens ' mobile phone division in 2005 .
after less than a year , benq cut off funds , declared bankruptcy and laid-off thousands of former siemens employees . kottmann admitted that he could n't exclude the possibility of a similar outcome at dürkopp adler .
however , there is one significant difference between the two formerly german companies : benq was n't able to dam the tide of ever-swelling loss , while sgsb has brought its struggling subsidiary into the black . acquisition was a win-win deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's take-over of siemens ' mobile phone division did n't go well indeed , dürkopp adler is no stranger to change .
within 30 years of its founding in bielefeld in 1860 , the " adler " name had become world-famous .
company founders tried their luck in a variety of branches - from typewriters to bicycles to cars - and finally settled on industrial sewing machines .
near the end of the 1970s , the company relocated production abroad as the sector struggled to keep its head above water . it was the reputable adler name and german technology that the shang-gong group needed to break out of the discount sector . " by becoming the majority stockholder , we gained dürkopp adler 's brand advantage and development capabilities , " said chinese management board member zheng ying . while bielefeld serves as a less expensive research center for the shang-gong group , shanghai is adler 's financial backer , market outlet and gateway into other asian countries . erning zhu / yanyan han -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a successful take-over by a chinese conglomerate made a success story out of a german sewing machine company . when dürkopp adler 's 1,750 employees heard in 2005 that their sewing machine company had been bought out by the chinese shang-gong group -lrb- sgsb -rrb- , many feared for their jobs .
their alarm was founded on other cases of chinese conglomerates buying up long-standing german companies - and gutting them to make a nice profit . but the 150-year-old sewing machine maker not had to slash jobs , and it 's been in the black since the take-over for the first time in years . " the number of employees at dürkopp adler has increased worldwide by around 50 , " said reinhard kottmann , the company 's head of accounting and controlling . production in the western city of bielefeld has n't changed and neither has the management , except for several chinese representatives on the board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much has changed at the dürkopp adler headquarters in bielefeld subsidiary kept afloat following the acquisition , sgsb pumped money into technological innovation at dürkopp adler .

they 've been so successful , that they 've won a major prize and postponed their studies . martin höfeler and anton jurina have a dream : to grow a company that employs methods that are sound for both the environment and their social conscience . " we want to create unique fashion that distinguishes itself from ' the cheaper , the better ' motto of mass production , " said höfeler . this past spring , the two students founded the social fashion company in cologne and , with it , the " armedangels " label that offers clothing manufactured " in ethically and ecologically acceptable ways , " höfeler said . promoting sustainability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armedangels design went through hundreds of drafts before it was finalized that means working with suppliers who do not use child labor and who offer their employees fair wages and agreeable working hours .
it also means that only pesticide-free cotton and as few chemicals as possible are used in the clothing 's production . other companies , such as american apparel , levi 's , nike and the swedish chain h & m have discovered that " eco-clothing " sells .
likewise , organic cosmetics companies are booming , and ever more firms are selling products based on fair-trade policies . but höfeler and jurina , aged 25 and 28 respectively , said their company distinguishes itself from all the rest : a portion of their profits is donated directly to charity organizations . right now , the armedangels line is made up of street wear-style t-shirts - short and long-sleeved , and tank tops - that range in price from 29 to 50 euros -lrb- $ 43 to $ 74 -rrb- .
for every shirt sold , armedangels passes on 3.33 euros in aid to schools and hospitals in bolivia . certified fair trade with chic design to ensure armedangels lives up to the students ' sustainability claim , it only works with socially responsible companies that have fair-trade labels and certificates . höfeler and jurina currently import cotton from peru and have t-shirts sewn on the island of mauritius , but intend to switch to a cotton producer in india with a good fair-trade reputation . germany simply is n't a cotton-producing country , höfeler pointed out , lamenting the environmental impact of long transportation routes . tired of common capitalist slogan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pesticides used on cotton plants do n't always wash out of clothing the duo was taking a corporate management class together when they concocted the armedangels idea . " we were tired of hearing the traditional capitalist motto of ' maximizing profits ' every time we went to a business class , " said höfeler , adding that he had always wanted to start his own company . the pair had spent enough time doing internships in large companies to realize they did not want to be cogs in what they called the capitalist machine .
instead , they decided to capitalize on the socially conscious market segment - with success . a conscientious idea that paid off höfeler and jurina 's social fashion company was awarded the " young entrepreneur " prize from the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche for finding the right combination of this eclectic mix of interests .

" with votes from 90 percent of polling stations counted , the democracy in action group said thaci 's pdk was leading with 34 percent , beating the once-dominant democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- into second place with 22 percent , reuters reported . thaci said the polls showed the province was ready for independence from serbia - a view that regularly receives high support among kosovo 's majority ethnic albanian population . status talks to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pdk appears set to form a coalition government with at least one other party the vote was held just days before an important set of negotiations in brussels to decide the future status of the southern serbian province , whose independence belgrade 's fiercely opposes .
chances of a breakthrough , however , are slim . " i do n't think anyone is that hopeful of a breakthrough on tuesday , " one diplomat told reuters , adding that eu members would in try to overcome national differences on whether to recognize any future kosovo independence claim . ldk , the largest party in the province , formed 18 years ago by the late creator of the kosovo albanian independence movement ibrahim rugova , was punished by voters and collected only 22 percent of the votes . ldk is , however , expected to remain in power as the junior partner in a grand coalition , as albanian leaders will want to forge a strong government quickly in time for the end of a round of un-sponsored talks on kosovo 's status with serbia on dec .
10 . albanian politicians are united in the view that kosovo must become independent immediately and their compatriots , who make up 90 percent of the 2 million kosovars , think the same . low voter turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most kosovars choose not to vote in the election the newcomer alliance new kosovo -lrb- akr -rrb- , founded by millionaire businessman behgjet pacolli in 2006 , came in third with 12 percent of the votes and may also figure in a future coalition . the elections were marred by a record low turnout of 45 percent , which was attributed to disillusionment of voters not only just by the elusive sovereignty , but by everyday issues which include huge unemployment , poverty and even regular power blackouts . " turnout was low because people are depressed , " said analyst berat buzhala of the daily kosovo express .
" this is about the economic situation - no water , no electricity , no jobs . " ethnic serb boycott saturday 's poll , which included voting for 30 municipal assemblies and mayors , was also marked by the comprehensive boycott by the provinces 120,000 ethnic serbs .
nearly all of them followed belgrade 's orders and kept away from polling stations .
many fear they would be driven out of an independent kosovo . the boycott , however , meant the serbs lost control over the five municipalities with mixed population in which they were a majority .
the situation in the exclusively-serb municipalities is unclear . by comparison , in 2001 serbs had won 11.3 percent of the votes and , with seats guaranteed for minorities , they had 22 representatives .
in the upcoming assembly they may take only the 10 seats reserved for them , belgrade analysts said . saturday 's elections were the third since a un administration and a nato peacekeeping force assumed control over kosovo in mid-1999 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 18.11.2007 chinese take-over turns around german company großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zheng ying has become the chinese head of dürkopp adler while the word " acquisition " can be enough to make an employee 's blood run cold .
a successful take-over by a chinese conglomerate made a success story out of a german sewing machine company . when dürkopp adler 's 1,750 employees heard in 2005 that their sewing machine company had been bought out by the chinese shang-gong group -lrb- sgsb -rrb- , many feared for their jobs .
their alarm was founded on other cases of chinese conglomerates buying up long-standing german companies - and gutting them to make a nice profit . but the 150-year-old sewing machine maker not had to slash jobs , and it 's been in the black since the take-over for the first time in years . " the number of employees at dürkopp adler has increased worldwide by around 50 , " said reinhard kottmann , the company 's head of accounting and controlling . production in the western city of bielefeld has n't changed and neither has the management , except for several chinese representatives on the board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much has changed at the dürkopp adler headquarters in bielefeld subsidiary kept afloat following the acquisition , sgsb pumped money into technological innovation at dürkopp adler .
the financial support was desperately needed for the company to maintain its technological edge on the global playing field . a massive 3.5-million euro -lrb- $ 5.1-million -rrb- order from the automotive branch - for 800 industrial sewing machines to make car seats - helped keep the company afloat .
it also made it clear that the chinese were capable of doing business , and not just buying up shares . landmark case leaves long-lasting fears despite the fact that dürkopp adler 's stock price has doubled since the beginning of 2006 , recently meeting its all-time high , not all concerns have been quelled as memories of other foreign investment companies taking over german firms remain . the taiwanese company benq 's acquisition of siemens ' mobile phone division in 2005 .
after less than a year , benq cut off funds , declared bankruptcy and laid-off thousands of former siemens employees . kottmann admitted that he could n't exclude the possibility of a similar outcome at dürkopp adler .
however , there is one significant difference between the two formerly german companies : benq was n't able to dam the tide of ever-swelling loss , while sgsb has brought its struggling subsidiary into the black . acquisition was a win-win deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's take-over of siemens ' mobile phone division did n't go well indeed , dürkopp adler is no stranger to change .
within 30 years of its founding in bielefeld in 1860 , the " adler " name had become world-famous .
company founders tried their luck in a variety of branches - from typewriters to bicycles to cars - and finally settled on industrial sewing machines .
near the end of the 1970s , the company relocated production abroad as the sector struggled to keep its head above water . it was the reputable adler name and german technology that the shang-gong group needed to break out of the discount sector . " by becoming the majority stockholder , we gained dürkopp adler 's brand advantage and development capabilities , " said chinese management board member zheng ying . while bielefeld serves as a less expensive research center for the shang-gong group , shanghai is adler 's financial backer , market outlet and gateway into other asian countries . erning zhu / yanyan han -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the union is demanding a 31 percent pay raise and a contact separate from other rail workers . deutsche bahn has offered to increase pay by up to 10 percent in exchange for longer working hours , but opposes giving the gdl its own contract , saying it would encourage small numbers other professionals to exploit their economic leverage to secure excessive raises . european consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european economy could suffer if raw materials are delivered to factories despite media reports over the weekend that the bahn was preparing a new contract , gdl deputy chairman claus weselsky told the german news agency dpa he was not aware of any higher offer yet . the european union said it hoped a deal would be reached quickly .

germany are up against wales in frankfurt on wednesday while the czech republic play cyprus in the concluding qualifying games . better concentration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw said germany were in better balance for the match against cyprus " all the goals were well worked and there was good movement from lukas on the -lsb- left -rsb- side , " germany coach joachim löw said .
" he was involved in all four goals .
he moved well and was able to use the space .
he is a top-class footballer .
it is a good alternative for us . " we began with the concentration we did n't have against czech republic , " löw added .
" if we keep the tempo up we can combine well .
if we take the pace off we make mistakes .
all in all we can go into next year with a very positive feeling . " löw could call on his 2006 world cup back four of arne friedrich , christoph metzelder , per mertesacker and philipp lahm in front of jens lehmann , earning his 50th cap in the german goal . but it was a new-look midfield , with löw having to replace the injured quartet of michael ballack , bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
podolski was given an attacking left-sided midfield role alongside hitzlsperger , fritz and piotr trochowski , with stuttgart 's mario gomez partnering klose up front . bildunterschrift : germany relived scenes some thought disappeared after the loss to the czech republic the selection immediately paid off when podolski set up the first goal after just 75 seconds when he bustled past three cyprus defenders along the byline to cross for fritz to score with a diving header . podolski started the move which led to werder bremen 's fritz providing the pass for miroslav klose to thread the ball through two cyprus defenders for a second in the 20th minute . germany booked their ticket for the euro 2008 last month before the setback of an embarrassing 3-0 home defeat against the czech republic . slight step forward but there were no signs of a similar slip-up , with the germans , who had drawn 1-1 with cyprus in nicosia a year ago , threatening to score with almost every attack . podolski increased the lead eight minutes after the break when he steered in a low cross from the right from bayern munich team-mate klose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been having trouble getting started at bayern munich goalkeeper antonis georgallidis could only parry podolski 's close-range shot into the roof of the net , but the ' keeper did well three minutes late to turn a podolski shot over the bar . however there was no stopping podolski eight minutes from time when he raced past two defenders into the area to send in a cross which hitzlsperger turned into the net from almost point-blank range to complete the scoring . " i am trying to show what i can do and i think it worked out well said podolski , who has struggled this season to get in the bayern munich side .
" it was a small step forward but i have to carry on working on my game .
then i can manage to have games like this one , but it should n't be over-rated . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 a coalition of kosovo 's two largest ethnic albanian parties and call for independence from serbia appeared to be the result of elections held in the province ahead of more talks with un envoys . the former kosovo albanian guerrilla leader hashim thaci declared victory sunday , nov .
18 , in kosovo 's parliamentary polls and immediately repeated the promise that independence from serbia is coming shortly . " a new era is starting , " thaci said early sunday .
" the citizens of kosovo have sent a message to the world that we are a democratic country and society . " with votes from 90 percent of polling stations counted , the democracy in action group said thaci 's pdk was leading with 34 percent , beating the once-dominant democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- into second place with 22 percent , reuters reported . thaci said the polls showed the province was ready for independence from serbia - a view that regularly receives high support among kosovo 's majority ethnic albanian population . status talks to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pdk appears set to form a coalition government with at least one other party the vote was held just days before an important set of negotiations in brussels to decide the future status of the southern serbian province , whose independence belgrade 's fiercely opposes .
chances of a breakthrough , however , are slim . " i do n't think anyone is that hopeful of a breakthrough on tuesday , " one diplomat told reuters , adding that eu members would in try to overcome national differences on whether to recognize any future kosovo independence claim . ldk , the largest party in the province , formed 18 years ago by the late creator of the kosovo albanian independence movement ibrahim rugova , was punished by voters and collected only 22 percent of the votes . ldk is , however , expected to remain in power as the junior partner in a grand coalition , as albanian leaders will want to forge a strong government quickly in time for the end of a round of un-sponsored talks on kosovo 's status with serbia on dec .
10 . albanian politicians are united in the view that kosovo must become independent immediately and their compatriots , who make up 90 percent of the 2 million kosovars , think the same . low voter turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most kosovars choose not to vote in the election the newcomer alliance new kosovo -lrb- akr -rrb- , founded by millionaire businessman behgjet pacolli in 2006 , came in third with 12 percent of the votes and may also figure in a future coalition . the elections were marred by a record low turnout of 45 percent , which was attributed to disillusionment of voters not only just by the elusive sovereignty , but by everyday issues which include huge unemployment , poverty and even regular power blackouts . " turnout was low because people are depressed , " said analyst berat buzhala of the daily kosovo express .

they 've been so successful , that they 've won a major prize and postponed their studies . martin höfeler and anton jurina have a dream : to grow a company that employs methods that are sound for both the environment and their social conscience . " we want to create unique fashion that distinguishes itself from ' the cheaper , the better ' motto of mass production , " said höfeler . this past spring , the two students founded the social fashion company in cologne and , with it , the " armedangels " label that offers clothing manufactured " in ethically and ecologically acceptable ways , " höfeler said . promoting sustainability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armedangels design went through hundreds of drafts before it was finalized that means working with suppliers who do not use child labor and who offer their employees fair wages and agreeable working hours .
it also means that only pesticide-free cotton and as few chemicals as possible are used in the clothing 's production . other companies , such as american apparel , levi 's , nike and the swedish chain h & m have discovered that " eco-clothing " sells .
likewise , organic cosmetics companies are booming , and ever more firms are selling products based on fair-trade policies . but höfeler and jurina , aged 25 and 28 respectively , said their company distinguishes itself from all the rest : a portion of their profits is donated directly to charity organizations . right now , the armedangels line is made up of street wear-style t-shirts - short and long-sleeved , and tank tops - that range in price from 29 to 50 euros -lrb- $ 43 to $ 74 -rrb- .
for every shirt sold , armedangels passes on 3.33 euros in aid to schools and hospitals in bolivia . certified fair trade with chic design to ensure armedangels lives up to the students ' sustainability claim , it only works with socially responsible companies that have fair-trade labels and certificates . höfeler and jurina currently import cotton from peru and have t-shirts sewn on the island of mauritius , but intend to switch to a cotton producer in india with a good fair-trade reputation . germany simply is n't a cotton-producing country , höfeler pointed out , lamenting the environmental impact of long transportation routes . tired of common capitalist slogan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pesticides used on cotton plants do n't always wash out of clothing the duo was taking a corporate management class together when they concocted the armedangels idea . " we were tired of hearing the traditional capitalist motto of ' maximizing profits ' every time we went to a business class , " said höfeler , adding that he had always wanted to start his own company . the pair had spent enough time doing internships in large companies to realize they did not want to be cogs in what they called the capitalist machine .
instead , they decided to capitalize on the socially conscious market segment - with success . a conscientious idea that paid off höfeler and jurina 's social fashion company was awarded the " young entrepreneur " prize from the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche for finding the right combination of this eclectic mix of interests .
as part of the honor , the company also received 250,000 euros to spend on marketing , business and legal advice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-shirts are the only items on armedangels ' racks - for now " armedangels had an enthusiastic team and absolutely convincing business idea that fits perfectly into the current trend of sustainable fashion and environmental consciousness , " said jochen mai , prize coordinator at wirtschaftswoche , which devoted its september cover to the notion that morals lead to profits . höfeler and jurina were also successful in another way : they convinced a few " business angels " - older , established business people willing to invest in young entrepreneurs - to give them start-up capital .
the two have been working so much that they postponed their studies in business and law . höfeler and jurina plan to expand armedangels , which is available exclusively on the internet . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 . the strike , which was the largest in deutsche bahn history , was called by the gdl , a small union , seeking a better deal for drivers than contracts previously accepted by two larger railways unions which also have clerical and engineering members . the gdl 's campaign has also angered the head germany 's social democratic party , part of chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition . threat to negotiating system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking train drivers were n't the only ones left out in the cold kurt beck , the spd chairman , told the paper that the strike was a threat to germany 's pay-bargaining system , in which unions agree to negotiate in blocs . " if it came about that every enterprise had a range of different collective labor contracts , the outcome would be great insecurity and instability , " he said . the drivers ' union , which has warned that its next strike may have no time limit , says it will not resume talks unless the railways company , deutsche bahn , speaks to the gdl alone and excludes the other two unions from the accord . it insisted sunday it would also not return to the negotiating table unless bahn raised its pay offer to drivers .
the union is demanding a 31 percent pay raise and a contact separate from other rail workers . deutsche bahn has offered to increase pay by up to 10 percent in exchange for longer working hours , but opposes giving the gdl its own contract , saying it would encourage small numbers other professionals to exploit their economic leverage to secure excessive raises . european consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european economy could suffer if raw materials are delivered to factories despite media reports over the weekend that the bahn was preparing a new contract , gdl deputy chairman claus weselsky told the german news agency dpa he was not aware of any higher offer yet . the european union said it hoped a deal would be reached quickly .
as france continues to experience a nationwide rail strike , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot told the bild am sonntag a long walk-outs could have serious economic consequences not only for all of europe . " -lsb- strikes -rsb- could damage the economy , not just in germany and france , but also in neighboring countries , " he said .
" i hope the two sides reach a deal via quick and fair negotiations - without waiting for the state to intervene .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de social change -pipe- 18.11.2007 german entrepreneurs successful with socially conscious firm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : höfeler -lrb- left -rrb- and jurina want their business to make both a fashion and social statement two german students have founded a fashion company that aims to use only ecologically and ethically sustainable business practices .
they 've been so successful , that they 've won a major prize and postponed their studies . martin höfeler and anton jurina have a dream : to grow a company that employs methods that are sound for both the environment and their social conscience . " we want to create unique fashion that distinguishes itself from ' the cheaper , the better ' motto of mass production , " said höfeler . this past spring , the two students founded the social fashion company in cologne and , with it , the " armedangels " label that offers clothing manufactured " in ethically and ecologically acceptable ways , " höfeler said . promoting sustainability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armedangels design went through hundreds of drafts before it was finalized that means working with suppliers who do not use child labor and who offer their employees fair wages and agreeable working hours .
it also means that only pesticide-free cotton and as few chemicals as possible are used in the clothing 's production . other companies , such as american apparel , levi 's , nike and the swedish chain h & m have discovered that " eco-clothing " sells .
likewise , organic cosmetics companies are booming , and ever more firms are selling products based on fair-trade policies . but höfeler and jurina , aged 25 and 28 respectively , said their company distinguishes itself from all the rest : a portion of their profits is donated directly to charity organizations . right now , the armedangels line is made up of street wear-style t-shirts - short and long-sleeved , and tank tops - that range in price from 29 to 50 euros -lrb- $ 43 to $ 74 -rrb- .
for every shirt sold , armedangels passes on 3.33 euros in aid to schools and hospitals in bolivia . certified fair trade with chic design to ensure armedangels lives up to the students ' sustainability claim , it only works with socially responsible companies that have fair-trade labels and certificates . höfeler and jurina currently import cotton from peru and have t-shirts sewn on the island of mauritius , but intend to switch to a cotton producer in india with a good fair-trade reputation . germany simply is n't a cotton-producing country , höfeler pointed out , lamenting the environmental impact of long transportation routes . tired of common capitalist slogan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pesticides used on cotton plants do n't always wash out of clothing the duo was taking a corporate management class together when they concocted the armedangels idea . " we were tired of hearing the traditional capitalist motto of ' maximizing profits ' every time we went to a business class , " said höfeler , adding that he had always wanted to start his own company . the pair had spent enough time doing internships in large companies to realize they did not want to be cogs in what they called the capitalist machine .
instead , they decided to capitalize on the socially conscious market segment - with success . a conscientious idea that paid off höfeler and jurina 's social fashion company was awarded the " young entrepreneur " prize from the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche for finding the right combination of this eclectic mix of interests .
as part of the honor , the company also received 250,000 euros to spend on marketing , business and legal advice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-shirts are the only items on armedangels ' racks - for now " armedangels had an enthusiastic team and absolutely convincing business idea that fits perfectly into the current trend of sustainable fashion and environmental consciousness , " said jochen mai , prize coordinator at wirtschaftswoche , which devoted its september cover to the notion that morals lead to profits . höfeler and jurina were also successful in another way : they convinced a few " business angels " - older , established business people willing to invest in young entrepreneurs - to give them start-up capital .
the two have been working so much that they postponed their studies in business and law . höfeler and jurina plan to expand armedangels , which is available exclusively on the internet . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he was involved in all four goals .
he moved well and was able to use the space .
he is a top-class footballer .
it is a good alternative for us . " we began with the concentration we did n't have against czech republic , " löw added .
" if we keep the tempo up we can combine well .
if we take the pace off we make mistakes .
all in all we can go into next year with a very positive feeling . " löw could call on his 2006 world cup back four of arne friedrich , christoph metzelder , per mertesacker and philipp lahm in front of jens lehmann , earning his 50th cap in the german goal . but it was a new-look midfield , with löw having to replace the injured quartet of michael ballack , bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
podolski was given an attacking left-sided midfield role alongside hitzlsperger , fritz and piotr trochowski , with stuttgart 's mario gomez partnering klose up front . bildunterschrift : germany relived scenes some thought disappeared after the loss to the czech republic the selection immediately paid off when podolski set up the first goal after just 75 seconds when he bustled past three cyprus defenders along the byline to cross for fritz to score with a diving header . podolski started the move which led to werder bremen 's fritz providing the pass for miroslav klose to thread the ball through two cyprus defenders for a second in the 20th minute . germany booked their ticket for the euro 2008 last month before the setback of an embarrassing 3-0 home defeat against the czech republic . slight step forward but there were no signs of a similar slip-up , with the germans , who had drawn 1-1 with cyprus in nicosia a year ago , threatening to score with almost every attack . podolski increased the lead eight minutes after the break when he steered in a low cross from the right from bayern munich team-mate klose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been having trouble getting started at bayern munich goalkeeper antonis georgallidis could only parry podolski 's close-range shot into the roof of the net , but the ' keeper did well three minutes late to turn a podolski shot over the bar . however there was no stopping podolski eight minutes from time when he raced past two defenders into the area to send in a cross which hitzlsperger turned into the net from almost point-blank range to complete the scoring . " i am trying to show what i can do and i think it worked out well said podolski , who has struggled this season to get in the bayern munich side .
" it was a small step forward but i have to carry on working on my game .
then i can manage to have games like this one , but it should n't be over-rated . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 've been so successful , that they 've won a major prize and postponed their studies . martin höfeler and anton jurina have a dream : to grow a company that employs methods that are sound for both the environment and their social conscience . " we want to create unique fashion that distinguishes itself from ' the cheaper , the better ' motto of mass production , " said höfeler . this past spring , the two students founded the social fashion company in cologne and , with it , the " armedangels " label that offers clothing manufactured " in ethically and ecologically acceptable ways , " höfeler said . promoting sustainability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armedangels design went through hundreds of drafts before it was finalized that means working with suppliers who do not use child labor and who offer their employees fair wages and agreeable working hours .
it also means that only pesticide-free cotton and as few chemicals as possible are used in the clothing 's production . other companies , such as american apparel , levi 's , nike and the swedish chain h & m have discovered that " eco-clothing " sells .
likewise , organic cosmetics companies are booming , and ever more firms are selling products based on fair-trade policies . but höfeler and jurina , aged 25 and 28 respectively , said their company distinguishes itself from all the rest : a portion of their profits is donated directly to charity organizations . right now , the armedangels line is made up of street wear-style t-shirts - short and long-sleeved , and tank tops - that range in price from 29 to 50 euros -lrb- $ 43 to $ 74 -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 18.11.2007 chinese take-over turns around german company großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zheng ying has become the chinese head of dürkopp adler while the word " acquisition " can be enough to make an employee 's blood run cold .
a successful take-over by a chinese conglomerate made a success story out of a german sewing machine company . when dürkopp adler 's 1,750 employees heard in 2005 that their sewing machine company had been bought out by the chinese shang-gong group -lrb- sgsb -rrb- , many feared for their jobs .
their alarm was founded on other cases of chinese conglomerates buying up long-standing german companies - and gutting them to make a nice profit . but the 150-year-old sewing machine maker not had to slash jobs , and it 's been in the black since the take-over for the first time in years . " the number of employees at dürkopp adler has increased worldwide by around 50 , " said reinhard kottmann , the company 's head of accounting and controlling . production in the western city of bielefeld has n't changed and neither has the management , except for several chinese representatives on the board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much has changed at the dürkopp adler headquarters in bielefeld subsidiary kept afloat following the acquisition , sgsb pumped money into technological innovation at dürkopp adler .
the financial support was desperately needed for the company to maintain its technological edge on the global playing field . a massive 3.5-million euro -lrb- $ 5.1-million -rrb- order from the automotive branch - for 800 industrial sewing machines to make car seats - helped keep the company afloat .
it also made it clear that the chinese were capable of doing business , and not just buying up shares . landmark case leaves long-lasting fears despite the fact that dürkopp adler 's stock price has doubled since the beginning of 2006 , recently meeting its all-time high , not all concerns have been quelled as memories of other foreign investment companies taking over german firms remain . the taiwanese company benq 's acquisition of siemens ' mobile phone division in 2005 .
after less than a year , benq cut off funds , declared bankruptcy and laid-off thousands of former siemens employees . kottmann admitted that he could n't exclude the possibility of a similar outcome at dürkopp adler .
however , there is one significant difference between the two formerly german companies : benq was n't able to dam the tide of ever-swelling loss , while sgsb has brought its struggling subsidiary into the black . acquisition was a win-win deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's take-over of siemens ' mobile phone division did n't go well indeed , dürkopp adler is no stranger to change .
within 30 years of its founding in bielefeld in 1860 , the " adler " name had become world-famous .
company founders tried their luck in a variety of branches - from typewriters to bicycles to cars - and finally settled on industrial sewing machines .
near the end of the 1970s , the company relocated production abroad as the sector struggled to keep its head above water . it was the reputable adler name and german technology that the shang-gong group needed to break out of the discount sector . " by becoming the majority stockholder , we gained dürkopp adler 's brand advantage and development capabilities , " said chinese management board member zheng ying . while bielefeld serves as a less expensive research center for the shang-gong group , shanghai is adler 's financial backer , market outlet and gateway into other asian countries . erning zhu / yanyan han -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a successful take-over by a chinese conglomerate made a success story out of a german sewing machine company . when dürkopp adler 's 1,750 employees heard in 2005 that their sewing machine company had been bought out by the chinese shang-gong group -lrb- sgsb -rrb- , many feared for their jobs .
their alarm was founded on other cases of chinese conglomerates buying up long-standing german companies - and gutting them to make a nice profit . but the 150-year-old sewing machine maker not had to slash jobs , and it 's been in the black since the take-over for the first time in years . " the number of employees at dürkopp adler has increased worldwide by around 50 , " said reinhard kottmann , the company 's head of accounting and controlling . production in the western city of bielefeld has n't changed and neither has the management , except for several chinese representatives on the board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much has changed at the dürkopp adler headquarters in bielefeld subsidiary kept afloat following the acquisition , sgsb pumped money into technological innovation at dürkopp adler .
the financial support was desperately needed for the company to maintain its technological edge on the global playing field . a massive 3.5-million euro -lrb- $ 5.1-million -rrb- order from the automotive branch - for 800 industrial sewing machines to make car seats - helped keep the company afloat .
it also made it clear that the chinese were capable of doing business , and not just buying up shares . landmark case leaves long-lasting fears despite the fact that dürkopp adler 's stock price has doubled since the beginning of 2006 , recently meeting its all-time high , not all concerns have been quelled as memories of other foreign investment companies taking over german firms remain . the taiwanese company benq 's acquisition of siemens ' mobile phone division in 2005 .
after less than a year , benq cut off funds , declared bankruptcy and laid-off thousands of former siemens employees . kottmann admitted that he could n't exclude the possibility of a similar outcome at dürkopp adler .
however , there is one significant difference between the two formerly german companies : benq was n't able to dam the tide of ever-swelling loss , while sgsb has brought its struggling subsidiary into the black . acquisition was a win-win deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's take-over of siemens ' mobile phone division did n't go well indeed , dürkopp adler is no stranger to change .
within 30 years of its founding in bielefeld in 1860 , the " adler " name had become world-famous .
company founders tried their luck in a variety of branches - from typewriters to bicycles to cars - and finally settled on industrial sewing machines .
near the end of the 1970s , the company relocated production abroad as the sector struggled to keep its head above water . it was the reputable adler name and german technology that the shang-gong group needed to break out of the discount sector . " by becoming the majority stockholder , we gained dürkopp adler 's brand advantage and development capabilities , " said chinese management board member zheng ying . while bielefeld serves as a less expensive research center for the shang-gong group , shanghai is adler 's financial backer , market outlet and gateway into other asian countries . erning zhu / yanyan han -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a successful take-over by a chinese conglomerate made a success story out of a german sewing machine company . when dürkopp adler 's 1,750 employees heard in 2005 that their sewing machine company had been bought out by the chinese shang-gong group -lrb- sgsb -rrb- , many feared for their jobs .
their alarm was founded on other cases of chinese conglomerates buying up long-standing german companies - and gutting them to make a nice profit . but the 150-year-old sewing machine maker not had to slash jobs , and it 's been in the black since the take-over for the first time in years . " the number of employees at dürkopp adler has increased worldwide by around 50 , " said reinhard kottmann , the company 's head of accounting and controlling . production in the western city of bielefeld has n't changed and neither has the management , except for several chinese representatives on the board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much has changed at the dürkopp adler headquarters in bielefeld subsidiary kept afloat following the acquisition , sgsb pumped money into technological innovation at dürkopp adler .
the financial support was desperately needed for the company to maintain its technological edge on the global playing field . a massive 3.5-million euro -lrb- $ 5.1-million -rrb- order from the automotive branch - for 800 industrial sewing machines to make car seats - helped keep the company afloat .
it also made it clear that the chinese were capable of doing business , and not just buying up shares . landmark case leaves long-lasting fears despite the fact that dürkopp adler 's stock price has doubled since the beginning of 2006 , recently meeting its all-time high , not all concerns have been quelled as memories of other foreign investment companies taking over german firms remain . the taiwanese company benq 's acquisition of siemens ' mobile phone division in 2005 .
after less than a year , benq cut off funds , declared bankruptcy and laid-off thousands of former siemens employees . kottmann admitted that he could n't exclude the possibility of a similar outcome at dürkopp adler .
however , there is one significant difference between the two formerly german companies : benq was n't able to dam the tide of ever-swelling loss , while sgsb has brought its struggling subsidiary into the black . acquisition was a win-win deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's take-over of siemens ' mobile phone division did n't go well indeed , dürkopp adler is no stranger to change .

" the number of employees at dürkopp adler has increased worldwide by around 50 , " said reinhard kottmann , the company 's head of accounting and controlling . production in the western city of bielefeld has n't changed and neither has the management , except for several chinese representatives on the board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much has changed at the dürkopp adler headquarters in bielefeld subsidiary kept afloat following the acquisition , sgsb pumped money into technological innovation at dürkopp adler .
the financial support was desperately needed for the company to maintain its technological edge on the global playing field . a massive 3.5-million euro -lrb- $ 5.1-million -rrb- order from the automotive branch - for 800 industrial sewing machines to make car seats - helped keep the company afloat .
it also made it clear that the chinese were capable of doing business , and not just buying up shares . landmark case leaves long-lasting fears despite the fact that dürkopp adler 's stock price has doubled since the beginning of 2006 , recently meeting its all-time high , not all concerns have been quelled as memories of other foreign investment companies taking over german firms remain . the taiwanese company benq 's acquisition of siemens ' mobile phone division in 2005 .
after less than a year , benq cut off funds , declared bankruptcy and laid-off thousands of former siemens employees . kottmann admitted that he could n't exclude the possibility of a similar outcome at dürkopp adler .
however , there is one significant difference between the two formerly german companies : benq was n't able to dam the tide of ever-swelling loss , while sgsb has brought its struggling subsidiary into the black . acquisition was a win-win deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's take-over of siemens ' mobile phone division did n't go well indeed , dürkopp adler is no stranger to change .
within 30 years of its founding in bielefeld in 1860 , the " adler " name had become world-famous .
company founders tried their luck in a variety of branches - from typewriters to bicycles to cars - and finally settled on industrial sewing machines .
near the end of the 1970s , the company relocated production abroad as the sector struggled to keep its head above water . it was the reputable adler name and german technology that the shang-gong group needed to break out of the discount sector . " by becoming the majority stockholder , we gained dürkopp adler 's brand advantage and development capabilities , " said chinese management board member zheng ying . while bielefeld serves as a less expensive research center for the shang-gong group , shanghai is adler 's financial backer , market outlet and gateway into other asian countries . erning zhu / yanyan han -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

plaid had always rejected the policy of creating its own peers because it wanted the lords to be fully elected .
but dafydd elis-thomas said his party 's vote for policy change would ensure it is better represented at westminster .
the process of nominating and selecting suitable candidates to go to the lords will now begin .
a meeting to decide the matter will be held in january .
plaid parliamentary leader elfyn llwyd had also argued that new powers for the welsh assembly , which are ratified by parliament , meant the party needed peers .
members voted on the policy change at a meeting of its national council in aberystwyth on saturday .
at plaid 's conference in september representatives agreed to review the policy after mr llwyd argued that peers were required to ensure planned legislation for wales was not blocked at westminster .
the members were also required to reflect the views of the people of wales in the upper chamber , he said .
the welsh assembly 's new powers under the government of wales act allows it to make its own laws in devolved areas , with the permission of parliament .
we have seen with the cash for honours scandal and all the problems that this has induced that the lords is not a very democratic institution bethan jenkins am mr llwyd warned that many in the house of lords might want to block such permission , known as orders in council .
lord elis-thomas , the only plaid party member to sit as a peer , has sat as a cross bencher , not as a party appointee , since 1992 .
speaking after the vote , he said : " i think it 's long overdue because we have not been represented as a party and as a point of view in the politics of wales in the second chamber of the uk , especially now when legislation , the orders that empower the assembly , are being made through westminster . "
but there was some opposition within the party ranks .
reform bethan jenkins am argued the lords needed to be completely reformed before plaid representatives were sent there .
" we have seen with the cash for honours scandal and all the problems that this has induced that the lords is not a very democratic institution , " she said .
" we should be utilising our resources in other ways .
" we should be looking forward to the referendum in 2011 or before - that is where we need to put our best people . "
plaid last discussed this issue in 1999 when a vote went against the motion .
meanwhile members of plaid 's national council also decided to note its vice president 's paper which queried the party 's support for a new military training academy in the vale of glamorgan .
this means that the issues raised by mep jilll evans , who also chairs cnd cymru , could be revisited in the future .
she believes the proposed 5,000-job centre is inconsistent with the spirit of the party 's defence policy .
a party spokesman denied that they were avoiding the issue .

plaid had always rejected the policy of creating its own peers because it wanted the lords to be fully elected .
but dafydd elis-thomas said his party 's vote for policy change would ensure it is better represented at westminster .
the process of nominating and selecting suitable candidates to go to the lords will now begin .
a meeting to decide the matter will be held in january .
plaid parliamentary leader elfyn llwyd had also argued that new powers for the welsh assembly , which are ratified by parliament , meant the party needed peers .
members voted on the policy change at a meeting of its national council in aberystwyth on saturday .
at plaid 's conference in september representatives agreed to review the policy after mr llwyd argued that peers were required to ensure planned legislation for wales was not blocked at westminster .
the members were also required to reflect the views of the people of wales in the upper chamber , he said .
the welsh assembly 's new powers under the government of wales act allows it to make its own laws in devolved areas , with the permission of parliament .
we have seen with the cash for honours scandal and all the problems that this has induced that the lords is not a very democratic institution bethan jenkins am mr llwyd warned that many in the house of lords might want to block such permission , known as orders in council .
lord elis-thomas , the only plaid party member to sit as a peer , has sat as a cross bencher , not as a party appointee , since 1992 .
speaking after the vote , he said : " i think it 's long overdue because we have not been represented as a party and as a point of view in the politics of wales in the second chamber of the uk , especially now when legislation , the orders that empower the assembly , are being made through westminster . "
but there was some opposition within the party ranks .
reform bethan jenkins am argued the lords needed to be completely reformed before plaid representatives were sent there .
" we have seen with the cash for honours scandal and all the problems that this has induced that the lords is not a very democratic institution , " she said .
" we should be utilising our resources in other ways .

dr sheila willis , director of ireland 's forensic science laboratory , said tv gave unrealistic expectations of how quickly crimes could be solved .
in a lecture in dublin , dr willis said the shows wrongly suggested they could be cracked within the space of an episode .
she said all partners in the criminal justice system needed to reach a shared level of understanding with regard to the role of forensic science .
dr willis was speaking as part of ireland 's science week .
a clear appreciation of the potential and limitations of forensic science was made difficult by the popularity of shows like csi .
csi -lrb- crime scene investigation -rrb- is one of the united states ' most popular programmes and the emmy award-winning franchise has produced the spin-offs csi : miami and csi : new york .
pattern evidence however , dr willis said such shows lead people to mistakenly believe only one forensic investigator handled evidence on a specific case .
they also wrongly suggested the forensic scientist always comes to a conclusive determination which would make or break a case by the end of the episode .
the leading scientist said such representations fostered a presumption that " the answers we supply are black and white , but of course there 's a grey area " .
in reality , " we do n't fit it in -lrb- in -rrb- 47 minutes , and the roles are not all rolled into one " , she said .
many forensic scientists specialised in chemistry , biology , dna , drugs or pattern evidence , she told delegates .
dr willis also said that a lack of a dna database in ireland " means we 're not getting the maximum value from science in this country " .
last year , a senior policeman in malaysia said us crime drama csi was helping criminals escape justice .
" csi and a few other series teach how to remove traces of crime , " said deputy inspector general musa hassan .
he told the country 's bernama news agency such television programmes provided insights into how police work and made them more efficient .

in a secret ballot , 83 % wanted new independent housing organisation newport city homes to take over the management of the properties .
newport council welcomed the move , which it had encouraged to ensure homes could be improved by 2012 .
home repairs costing £ 233m will start in months .
the council said it has worked closely with tenants and leaseholders during the last 16 months to develop proposals that will ensure council properties can be improved up to the standard set by the welsh assembly government .
tenants can rest assured that the board is committed to delivering all the promises made to tenants during the consultation chris england , chair of the board of newport city homes councillor bob bright , leader of the council , said : " the ballot result is a vote for better homes for existing tenants and future generations of tenants .
" tenants have clearly recognised the very difficult financial position facing the council .
" while the council has always worked hard to provide good homes and services for its tenants , a lack of resources meant we simply could not afford to bring homes up to the welsh housing quality standard .
" with this result , newport city homes will be able to deliver the repairs and improvements that are needed . "
chris england , chair of the board of newport city homes , said : " this is a great result for the future of housing across newport .
" tenants can rest assured that the board is committed to delivering all the promises made to tenants during the consultation . "
monitored in the ballot , 63.3 % of tenants voted , with 83.8 % in favour and 16.2 % against the transfer proposal .
on its website , the council said newport city homes is a not-for-profit registered social landlord , established to manage the properties formerly owned by the council .
the new organisation will be entirely independent of the council but will have five council nominees on its board .
it will also be monitored by the council to ensure it fulfils its promises .
in 2006 , independent think-tank the institute of welsh affairs suggested all council housing in wales should be transferred into private hands to help pay for housing repairs .
it said the move would raise the estimated £ 3 billion needed for improvements over the next 30 years .

in the video , filmed by a family friend in august and to be screened on bbc one 's panorama , he tells of a " window of opportunity " taken by an abductor .
that belief made him and wife kate " sick to the core " , he said .
madeleine , of rothley , leics , vanished from a holiday apartment in portugal on 3 may , days before her fourth birthday . "
i 've no doubt that madeleine was targeted and that makes us sick to the core to think that someone was watching us and our daughter " gerry mccann friend tells of abduction the footage - filmed in portugal by friend jon corner and to be shown as part of a panorama programme on monday - captures a time when suspicion over the disappearance began to fall on the couple .
the mccanns , both 39 , became suspects with " arguido " status in the case in september but deny any involvement .
mr mccann said that , before madeleine went missing , he and his wife had been concerned by the security at the back of their praia da luz apartment when " maybe the weak spots were at the front " .
" it 's a corner flat with trees overlooking it - somebody could be hiding there or watching out of view , " he said .
he added : " i 've no doubt that madeleine was targeted and that makes us sick to the core to think that someone was watching us and our daughter and then targeted her - i think the true word is a predator .
" but you just do n't think there 's any trouble and it 's certainly the furthest thing from our mind . "
campaign pressure in one scene on the video , kate is shown hanging washing out to dry while , in another , mr mccann is shown making missing posters of madeleine on his laptop computer .
also in the film , mrs mccann talks of the pressures posed by the campaign to find madeleine and her regret at leaving their children alone in the apartment on 3 may .
the couple dined with a group of friends as they left madeleine and their two other children asleep in an apartment nearby .
" there 's not a textbook about it is there ?
like what to do when your daughter gets abducted , " she said .
" it 's awful and horrible for anyone to have to go through and we are just doing what we think is best . "
possible sighting the panorama programme also features an interview with the mccanns ' friend jane tanner , who dined with the couple in a tapas restaurant on the night of madeleine 's disappearance .
in an exclusive interview , she told the bbc she saw a man carrying a child through praia da luz .
meanwhile , the head of the spanish private detective agency hired by the mccanns has told us network cbs in an interview he was certain madeleine was abducted and the abductor was close to being caught .
the couple 's spokesman clarence mitchell has also confirmed that a possible sighting of madeleine somewhere in portugal on 5 may was now being investigated by private detectives .
