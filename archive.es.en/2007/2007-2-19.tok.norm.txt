the reason ?
the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .
this is when germany 's " baby-boomer " generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate . " the shortfall in the work-place will put a brake on the economy , " plünnecke said . france gets it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose side is ursula von der leyen on ?
to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .
" but i want to emphasize that parents who stay home with their kids from birth until the age of three should not be regarded as belonging to the last century .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 19.02.2007 german cuisine gets molecular makeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : molecular cooking can make everything else look boring molecular gastronomy champions unconventional tastes and textures and the revolutionary way of cooking is showing up in german restaurants as chefs use unconventional methods to invent unusual food . licorice is paired with salmon .
caviar gets served atop white chocolate or warm ice cream .
if a dish sounds like it defies the laws of nature , it 's likely a matter of molecular gastronomy , an approach to cooking that has entered the mainstream over the past few years . the most well known practitioner of this innovative way of cooking is spain 's three-star chef ferran adria .
at the beginning of the new millennium he grabbed headlines with creations such as apple caviar , parmesan spaghetti and blackberry-tobacco sorbet . a drizzle of science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : appearance is important german cuisine is also receiving a molecular twist as more chefs turn to physics and chemistry to create unusual dining experiences .
one practitioner of molecular gastronomy is the düsseldorf-based chef richard nicolaus . his restaurant , km 747 , is located in a quiet area near the rhine river .
the kitchen is a far cry from the typical mad scientist 's laboratory with nary a test tube or microscope in sight .
the science begins when nicolaus starts cooking . " we 're going to make a satay skewer from tuna fish , and what 's different is that the tuna fish will be fried in a sugar water mixture at 120 degrees -lrb- celsius -rrb- , " nicolaus said . normally , the tuna would be cooked in oil , leaving it fatty .
by using a special type of sugar that heats like oil , nicolaus can cook the tuna and have it ready to serve in 10 seconds . " from the outside it 's almost crispy , " he said .
" i 'll drizzle a little with lemon over it and then season it with a fish-vegetable mixture . " the tuna fish creation is only one of many .
guests can also try tomato jelly or cucumber foam .
for each dish on the menu , nicolaus uses a different trick from the molecular cooking world .
sauces are transformed into foam .
meat is cooked in a vacuum .
with the help of new substances he creates completely new consistencies . inventing new tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cooks are starting to think - and act - like chemists molecular cooking is pure physics , nicolaus said . " people nowadays want to experience new things , " he said .
" they want to discover new tastes and it happens that science brings the possibility for new products like , for example , jellies or chemicals . " the düsseldorf native came to molecular cooking via mechanical engineering .
for 10 years he 'd cooked as a hobby .
but when he got the chance , he gladly exchanged a drawing table and compass for an oven and ladle and his background in mechanical engineering made it feel natural to experiment in the kitchen with the design and form of his culinary creations . the menu at km 747 does n't make it obvious that the chef is using a radically different method to prepare food .
the ingredients sound normal : smoked breast of duck , curry soup , grilled perch .
the surprise comes dish is served , said tanja schuch . " for me , the combination is important , " schuch said .
" a pea-mint purée , i have never eaten that way .
but when you taste it , it 's absolutely a culinary delight , and it 's obviously also visually interesting . " guests often ask nicolaus why , for example , the spinach on their plate forms a small tower instead of looking like its normal squishy self .
they want to know how he gets the duck breast so tender and how he made the seafood risotto .
nicolaus said he chats willingly about his cooking concept . but he does n't give diners much hope that they can recreate his food creations .
nicolaus spends a lot of time experimenting and honing his specialized techniques that , like all excellent cooking , require more effort than simply mixing ingredients together . nadja baeva -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de have your cake and eat it too in germany , enjoying coffee and cake in the afternoon is n't just for grannies .

if a dish sounds like it defies the laws of nature , it 's likely a matter of molecular gastronomy , an approach to cooking that has entered the mainstream over the past few years . the most well known practitioner of this innovative way of cooking is spain 's three-star chef ferran adria .
at the beginning of the new millennium he grabbed headlines with creations such as apple caviar , parmesan spaghetti and blackberry-tobacco sorbet . a drizzle of science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : appearance is important german cuisine is also receiving a molecular twist as more chefs turn to physics and chemistry to create unusual dining experiences .
one practitioner of molecular gastronomy is the düsseldorf-based chef richard nicolaus . his restaurant , km 747 , is located in a quiet area near the rhine river .
the kitchen is a far cry from the typical mad scientist 's laboratory with nary a test tube or microscope in sight .
the science begins when nicolaus starts cooking . " we 're going to make a satay skewer from tuna fish , and what 's different is that the tuna fish will be fried in a sugar water mixture at 120 degrees -lrb- celsius -rrb- , " nicolaus said . normally , the tuna would be cooked in oil , leaving it fatty .
by using a special type of sugar that heats like oil , nicolaus can cook the tuna and have it ready to serve in 10 seconds . " from the outside it 's almost crispy , " he said .
" i 'll drizzle a little with lemon over it and then season it with a fish-vegetable mixture . " the tuna fish creation is only one of many .

for 10 years he 'd cooked as a hobby .
but when he got the chance , he gladly exchanged a drawing table and compass for an oven and ladle and his background in mechanical engineering made it feel natural to experiment in the kitchen with the design and form of his culinary creations . the menu at km 747 does n't make it obvious that the chef is using a radically different method to prepare food .
the ingredients sound normal : smoked breast of duck , curry soup , grilled perch .
the surprise comes dish is served , said tanja schuch . " for me , the combination is important , " schuch said .
" a pea-mint purée , i have never eaten that way .
but when you taste it , it 's absolutely a culinary delight , and it 's obviously also visually interesting . " guests often ask nicolaus why , for example , the spinach on their plate forms a small tower instead of looking like its normal squishy self .
they want to know how he gets the duck breast so tender and how he made the seafood risotto .
nicolaus said he chats willingly about his cooking concept . but he does n't give diners much hope that they can recreate his food creations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 19.02.2007 report : baby boom will push france ahead of germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its younger generation will help france speed ahead according to a new study , germany is set to concede its lead as europe 's largest economy to france by the mid 21st century .
the reason ?
the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .
this is when germany 's " baby-boomer " generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate .

caviar gets served atop white chocolate or warm ice cream .
if a dish sounds like it defies the laws of nature , it 's likely a matter of molecular gastronomy , an approach to cooking that has entered the mainstream over the past few years . the most well known practitioner of this innovative way of cooking is spain 's three-star chef ferran adria .
at the beginning of the new millennium he grabbed headlines with creations such as apple caviar , parmesan spaghetti and blackberry-tobacco sorbet . a drizzle of science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : appearance is important german cuisine is also receiving a molecular twist as more chefs turn to physics and chemistry to create unusual dining experiences .
one practitioner of molecular gastronomy is the düsseldorf-based chef richard nicolaus . his restaurant , km 747 , is located in a quiet area near the rhine river .
the kitchen is a far cry from the typical mad scientist 's laboratory with nary a test tube or microscope in sight .
the science begins when nicolaus starts cooking . " we 're going to make a satay skewer from tuna fish , and what 's different is that the tuna fish will be fried in a sugar water mixture at 120 degrees -lrb- celsius -rrb- , " nicolaus said . normally , the tuna would be cooked in oil , leaving it fatty .
by using a special type of sugar that heats like oil , nicolaus can cook the tuna and have it ready to serve in 10 seconds . " from the outside it 's almost crispy , " he said .
" i 'll drizzle a little with lemon over it and then season it with a fish-vegetable mixture . " the tuna fish creation is only one of many .
guests can also try tomato jelly or cucumber foam .
for each dish on the menu , nicolaus uses a different trick from the molecular cooking world .
sauces are transformed into foam .
meat is cooked in a vacuum .
with the help of new substances he creates completely new consistencies . inventing new tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cooks are starting to think - and act - like chemists molecular cooking is pure physics , nicolaus said . " people nowadays want to experience new things , " he said .
" they want to discover new tastes and it happens that science brings the possibility for new products like , for example , jellies or chemicals . " the düsseldorf native came to molecular cooking via mechanical engineering .
for 10 years he 'd cooked as a hobby .
but when he got the chance , he gladly exchanged a drawing table and compass for an oven and ladle and his background in mechanical engineering made it feel natural to experiment in the kitchen with the design and form of his culinary creations . the menu at km 747 does n't make it obvious that the chef is using a radically different method to prepare food .
the ingredients sound normal : smoked breast of duck , curry soup , grilled perch .
the surprise comes dish is served , said tanja schuch . " for me , the combination is important , " schuch said .
" a pea-mint purée , i have never eaten that way .
but when you taste it , it 's absolutely a culinary delight , and it 's obviously also visually interesting . " guests often ask nicolaus why , for example , the spinach on their plate forms a small tower instead of looking like its normal squishy self .
they want to know how he gets the duck breast so tender and how he made the seafood risotto .
nicolaus said he chats willingly about his cooking concept . but he does n't give diners much hope that they can recreate his food creations .
nicolaus spends a lot of time experimenting and honing his specialized techniques that , like all excellent cooking , require more effort than simply mixing ingredients together . nadja baeva -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de have your cake and eat it too in germany , enjoying coffee and cake in the afternoon is n't just for grannies .

" the atmosphere is becoming more and more tense , " a union source said friday as the release of the plan approached . eads , which owns airbus , is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close political ties .
the remaining 42 percent is publicly held . workers unnerved by possible cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker 's union wants employees to mobilize against the restructuring program the cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " that has unnerved workers in both france and germany , which hold major stakes in eads . airbus , employing about 56,000 people , has said the restructuring will entail job losses , carried out according to age considerations as well as through a reduction in part-time and short-term employment . the manufacturer hopes to save 30 percent in operating costs .
it is expected to tighten the management structure of subsidiaries in france , germany , spain and britain and to streamline certain administrative functions . a greater reliance is also foreseen on sub-contractors for activities that are not part of the core airbus operation .
sources have said the plan would reduce internal production from 65 percent to 50 percent . jobs at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois is facing pressure from french and german political leaders in addition , some of the 16 european sites could be closed or sold under changes in the distribution of production tasks in europe . the french business newspaper les echos reported on monday that airbus could cut up to 12,000 jobs , with 3,000-4,000 in both france and germany . la tribune daily said the plan could affect up to 10,000 jobs and that three factories would close : meaulte in france and varel and nordenham in germany . job losses are a particularly sensitive issue in france in the run up to presidential elections in april and may this year . the french cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " . german workers , who fear they will bear the brunt of the reorganization , are especially anxious about the fate of a plant in hamburg , which has been held partially responsible for production problems with the a380 . unconfirmed reports have said some of the work done on the a380 could be transferred to airbus plants in toulouse , southern france , which would also be responsible for assembling the new a350 long-haul carrier . in exchange the hamburg factory would take on assembling the single-aisle a320 . politicians applying pressure in december , airbus chief gallois said when launching the 10-billion-euro a350xwb project that it depended on application of power 8 .
airbus is counting on cost savings to help finance the development and manufacturing costs of the aircraft , which is destined to compete with the successful boeing 787 dreamliner . the plan is fraught with delicate political considerations , with german and french national interests bound up in its implementation . german economy minister michael glos has vowed to do everything possible to protect the future of german production sites and has hinted that germany might consider withdrawing some of its defense contracts with eads , the airbus parent . in a veiled threat illustrating the political pressure placed on eads and airbus , german economy minister michael glos warned at the beginning of the month that the country would " review " its contracts with eads if job cuts hit german workers more workers in other countries . gallois has meanwhile had to defend the project in meetings with french prime minister dominique de villepin and german chancellor angela merkel , who have demanded balanced treatment for all parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program airbus may be looking for companies to take over production sites threatened with closure under a major restructuring plan , said german state leader christian wulff , after talks with execs from airbus parent firm eads .

the reason ?
the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .
this is when germany 's " baby-boomer " generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate . " the shortfall in the work-place will put a brake on the economy , " plünnecke said . france gets it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose side is ursula von der leyen on ?
to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .
" but i want to emphasize that parents who stay home with their kids from birth until the age of three should not be regarded as belonging to the last century .

many in europe , however , remain concerned about the country 's spotty human rights record . meeting eu demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aliev was in berlin last week looking for germany to invest in his country aliev said during a visit to germany last week that his oil-rich nation needed another five years to raise human-rights standards to match levels required under good-neighbor agreements with european states . germany , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , played an important role in tightening the 27-member bloc 's relations with azerbaijan . european union officials vowed last year to forge stronger links with suppliers of vital oil and gas in a bid to ease the bloc 's current dependence on energy-rich but increasingly assertive russia . the eu is backing westward gas pipelines from the caspian sea fields via ukraine and turkey .
a line , code-named nabucco , is to be commissioned by 2011 .
it would pick up gas from turkish pipelines and shift it to western europe 's grid via bulgaria and romania . during his trip , steinmeier is also scheduled to confer with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and armenian prime minister andranik margarjan . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to visit former soviet republics foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier began a series of visits to the southern caucasus states of azerbaijan , georgia and armenia on sunday to discuss energy issues with the oil-rich former soviet republics .

but they could lose their place at the top if they are n't careful , germany 's environment minister pointed out . germany 's renewable energy sector exported installations worth 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- in 2006 , as opposed to exports of only 500 million euros in 2000 , the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung -lrb- fas -rrb- newspaper wrote on sunday , quoting figures from the branch association bundesverband erneuerbare energien .
the branch intends to grow by 10 percent each year and to reach turnover of around 120 billion euros by 2010 .
currently turnover stands at around 16.4 billion euros .
the branch also aimed to increase the number of workers in the field - now around 170,000 - to 500,000 by 2010 , the paper wrote .
companies in " hamburg , husum , thalheim and freiburg are the stars in the production of solar cells , windmills and bio-fuel plants , " according to the fas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of freiburg also uses water power one-third of the water-power installations worldwide come from the german company voith from heidesheim , and nearly every other windmill and every third solar cell were made in germany , the paper wrote .
thirty-four percent of the cells were exported .
us could be a threat the paper credited germany 's previous government of social democrats and greens with fostering renewable energies , but said the breakthrough in the field was a result of the worldwide debate about climate change and concerns about russia supplying energy to europe . german environment minister sigmar gabriel , however , said that us companies could take the place of german and european companies in important export markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel , a social democrat , says germany has to work hard to stay on top " europe must make a great effort not to be left behind , " he told the financial times deutschland in an interview published monday . " the usa is making enormous leeway in the use of renewable energies , though not so much for ecological reasons , but rather strategic reasons , " he said .
" they discovered these energies to make themselves more independent of gas and oil imports . " gabriel announced that , consequently , he work toward doubling the amount of non-fossil new energies in germany by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un : europe needs to increase efforts to fight climate change european countries need to lead by example to counteract the effects of global warming instead of complaining about nations that are n't pulling their weight , the head of the un 's environment program said saturday .

" we are bearing proof of its ability to evolve , to adapt to new circumstances and to the demands of our citizens , " said villepin . the changes strike a balance between the need for transparency , the equality of all citizens before the law and the stability of the state , added the prime minister . the amendment was adopted by a vote of 449 to 203 , with 217 abstentions . under the changes , a two-thirds majority of votes from both houses is required to launch the impeachment proceedings against the president . chirac may face probe the vote followed two landmark court rulings reached early in chirac 's mandate , which established that a serving president can not be prosecuted , charged or forced to testify in a common law case . the two rulings , by the constitutional court in 1999 and france 's highest appeals court , the cour de cassation , in 2001 , sparked controversy by enabling chirac to avoid questioning in a corruption probe . but they also specified that the president 's time in office should not be taken into account under the statute of limitations , meaning chirac could be questioned once he stands down . in particular he could be investigated over illegal salaries paid to members of his party out of paris municipal coffers between 1988 and 1995 - over which his ally and former prime minister alain juppe was convicted in 2004 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and chirac urge african leaders to confront own crises german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac on thursday urged african leaders meeting in the riviera resort of cannes to work to resolve ongoing crises on their continent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the clock is ticking eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions germany in top five countries fighting climate change germany boosts investment in climate change research interviews : the united nations and climate change environment -pipe- 19.02.2007 german plan to tax cars on emissions gets wary nod großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who drive polluting cars will be penalized under the proposed plan plans by the german government to tax cars based on emissions instead of engine size in a bid to encourage carmakers to design " greener " cars have met with a cautious welcome . german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee insisted monday that a planned flat tax on cars based on emissions would not impose a financial burden on car owners . " the aim is not to make more money , but to do something for the environment , " he said . tiefensee pointed out that the levy would instead replace an existing tax that rises in step with the cubic capacity of a car 's engine . " overall car owners will not pay more taxes that they have until now , " said sigmar gabriel , the country 's environment minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee says german carmakers have to do more to cut emissions tiefensee said over the weekend that germany and other european carmakers had to do more to protect the environment after the head of the un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , achim steiner said in a newspaper interview that european nations were not doing enough to fight climate change and had grown complacent . " the government will be pursuing that aim and that 's why we 're going to reform the motor vehicle taxes .
the size of the engine will no longer be the determining factor but rather the impact on the environment , not only co2 but other pollutants , " tiefensee told a news conference . " those who continue to drive stink-bombs will have to pay more .
we want a system that both rewards and punishes .
i 'm sure that 'll help boost technology for cars in germany and europe that pollute less and need less fuel . " tiefensee said legislation could possibly be drafted by berlin before the year is out . germany europe 's biggest polluter germany remains europe 's biggest polluter .
though german chancellor angela merkel has vowed to make fighting climate change a priority during germany 's twin presidencies of the eu and g8 , the country 's recent track record on cutting greenhouses gases has slipped . germany had pledged to cut co2 emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 under the kyoto protocol , but is likely to fall short of its target by one-fifth .
scientists warn that if emissions are n't curbed , it will lead to dramatic climatic changers , triggering frequent droughts and floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say imposing a speed limit on germany 's autobahns is the quickest way to cut pollution critics have said that a general speed limit on highways would be the quickest way to cut emissions .
germany 's 12,000-kilometer autobahn system is unique in the world , having no limits on most of its length .
but tiefensee has strongly opposed speed limits . advocates say plan could cut pollution tiefensee 's proposal to tax cars based on emissions was welcomed by some on monday . " if germany went ahead with such a tax , then i 'm sure many others would follow , " eu industry commissioner günther verheugen told a german radio station . the german car industry too seemed open to the proposal .
bernd gottschalk , president of the association of german carmakers , said it would give people an additional incentive to trade in their cars for new , more efficient vehicles . daimlerchrysler , maker of mercedes cars and trucks , welcomed the proposal in principle .
a spokeswoman said changing the tax scale from engine size to emissions made sense , but added , " the tax should not have an impact on competition . " currently the flat vehicle tax in germany for a used car of just under 2 liters ' engine capacity is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- per year . environment minister sigmar gabriel said nine of the european union 's 27 nations already tax cars according to emission quality and this had been partly successful in cutting carbon-dioxide output . critics say tax is not fair however battle lines could soon be drawn over the tax change .

" the depiction of islam was " barefaced lies " and the float was " using negative images to seek attention , " the central council 's secretary general aiman mazyek told tuesday 's edition of the westdeutsche zeitung daily . mazyek said he asked himself what the float was meant to signal .
" this is how i read the message : ' we love our prejudices and we strengthen them with blatant lies if necessary , " ' mazyek told the paper .
" it has nothing to do with humor , " he added . carnival back to satirical themes organizers of the festivities in the carnival centers of cologne , düsseldorf and mainz had promised a return to satirical themes this year after a relatively restrained showing in 2006 in the wake of the controversy over the publication by a danish newspaper of cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french presidential candidates sarkozy and royal depicted as boxing cockerels cologne played host to the main parade , with 99 floats edging through the city , cheered on by hundreds of thousands of revellers in costume and wearing wigs . one float in cologne showed us president george w. bush being spanked by the statue of liberty while another depicted french presidential candidates segolene royal and nicolas sarkozy as boxing cockerels . carnival is a tradition stemming from catholic regions in the west and south of germany , but it is rapidly being adopted by cities in the north and east . the processions take place on what is known as rose monday , although opinions differ on the origin of the term . some say it is derived from the word " rhosen " from the rhineland dialect , meaning dashing or romping .
others link it to rose sunday , so-called since the middle ages because the pope traditionally presented a golden rose to a worthy citizen on that day . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel to european parliament : " europe 's soul is tolerance " french satire mag in court over reprinted mohammad cartoons in a civil action , muslim groups have taken a french satire magazine to court for reprinting the controversial danish cartoons of the prophet mohammad .

" the aim is not to make more money , but to do something for the environment , " he said . tiefensee pointed out that the levy would instead replace an existing tax that rises in step with the cubic capacity of a car 's engine . " overall car owners will not pay more taxes that they have until now , " said sigmar gabriel , the country 's environment minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee says german carmakers have to do more to cut emissions tiefensee said over the weekend that germany and other european carmakers had to do more to protect the environment after the head of the un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , achim steiner said in a newspaper interview that european nations were not doing enough to fight climate change and had grown complacent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 19.02.2007 opinion : the glitzy film festival with a heart of gold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 57th international berlin film festival drew to a close saturday with the announcement of the competition winners .
star-studded as it was , the event never forgot its social conscience , says dw 's silke bartlick . every year , the entertainment spotlight turns to the german capital for the annual berlin film festival .
for 10 days every february , the city becomes the cinematic center of the world , attracting some of the biggest names in the industry .
this year 's a-list guests included actors clint eastwood , matt damon , charlotte rampling and sharon stone , as well as directors francois ozon and bille august . jennifer lopez lit up the red carpet with classic hollywood star wattage , vamping it up in glamorous contrast to her on-screen character .
in " bordertown , " la lopez plays an ambitious reporter investigating a series of mysterious murders on the mexican border .
the movie is based on true events that took place in the early 1990s in ciudad juarez , where hundreds of young women working in american factories across the border were killed .
festival director dieter kosslick even flew in several of the victims ' mothers for the press conference . it was a gesture of compassion , but one that was also designed to remind the public that this glitzy event has a political agenda - which kosslick is at constant pains to emphasize . this is the film festival with a social conscience , as both the movie selection and the choice of winners demonstrate every year .
most of the 400-off films shown during the festival serve as a comment on the state of the world and its recent history .
themes include discrimination , war , racism , poverty and social exclusion - as well as courage and personal fortitude .
they explore the seamier side of capitalism and globalization and do n't shy away from controversial topics - for example " la masseria delle allodole " -lrb- the lark farm -rrb- by italian directors paolo and vittorio taviani , a movie which tackles the armenian genocide that took place in turkey in the early 20th century . so much to worthy topics .
artistically , many of the films featured in the festival were less impressive - although they were all well attended . most movie showings were sold out , and thousands of people stood in line everyday in the hope of snaring a ticket .
people of all ages and nationalities , with one thing in common - their appreciation of intelligent cinema . the robust business going on at the european film market , taking place along side the festival , also suggests that kosslick 's much-touted " socially aware " festival does in fact put its money where its mouth is .
some 70 percent of the 618 films , including more than 400 market premieres , were festival entries .
so not only is the festival showcasing cinema from around the world , it 's also helping them get distribution . in this respect , the festival is contributing to an international cultural dialogue that continues long after the event has come to an end .
another of its strong points is its talent campus , which brings together several hundred young film-makers from around the world and gives them an opportunity to meet and learn from industry professionals .
every year , last year 's participants get to show the fruits of their labor .
it 's a resounding success - as is the entire berlin film festival . silke bartlick covers culture for dw-radio 's german program -lrb- jp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese film " tuya 's marriage " wins golden bear at berlinale the 57th berlin international film festival came to an end on saturday with the golden bear for best film going to chinese movie " tuya 's marriage . "
german actress nina hoss meanwhile picked up a silver bear .
-lrb- 17.02.2007 -rrb- a game of luck : selling movies at the berlinale festival director dieter kosslick called the 2007 event a " berlinale of stars . "
but beyond the red carpet , the somewhat less glamorous stage of the european film market is what really counts for many .

that 's changed as the festival has turned from artistic showcase into a marketing tool for movies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the clock is ticking eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions germany in top five countries fighting climate change germany boosts investment in climate change research interviews : the united nations and climate change environment -pipe- 19.02.2007 german plan to tax cars on emissions gets wary nod großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who drive polluting cars will be penalized under the proposed plan plans by the german government to tax cars based on emissions instead of engine size in a bid to encourage carmakers to design " greener " cars have met with a cautious welcome . german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee insisted monday that a planned flat tax on cars based on emissions would not impose a financial burden on car owners . " the aim is not to make more money , but to do something for the environment , " he said . tiefensee pointed out that the levy would instead replace an existing tax that rises in step with the cubic capacity of a car 's engine . " overall car owners will not pay more taxes that they have until now , " said sigmar gabriel , the country 's environment minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee says german carmakers have to do more to cut emissions tiefensee said over the weekend that germany and other european carmakers had to do more to protect the environment after the head of the un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , achim steiner said in a newspaper interview that european nations were not doing enough to fight climate change and had grown complacent . " the government will be pursuing that aim and that 's why we 're going to reform the motor vehicle taxes .
the size of the engine will no longer be the determining factor but rather the impact on the environment , not only co2 but other pollutants , " tiefensee told a news conference . " those who continue to drive stink-bombs will have to pay more .
we want a system that both rewards and punishes .
i 'm sure that 'll help boost technology for cars in germany and europe that pollute less and need less fuel . " tiefensee said legislation could possibly be drafted by berlin before the year is out . germany europe 's biggest polluter germany remains europe 's biggest polluter .
though german chancellor angela merkel has vowed to make fighting climate change a priority during germany 's twin presidencies of the eu and g8 , the country 's recent track record on cutting greenhouses gases has slipped . germany had pledged to cut co2 emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 under the kyoto protocol , but is likely to fall short of its target by one-fifth .
scientists warn that if emissions are n't curbed , it will lead to dramatic climatic changers , triggering frequent droughts and floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say imposing a speed limit on germany 's autobahns is the quickest way to cut pollution critics have said that a general speed limit on highways would be the quickest way to cut emissions .
germany 's 12,000-kilometer autobahn system is unique in the world , having no limits on most of its length .
but tiefensee has strongly opposed speed limits . advocates say plan could cut pollution tiefensee 's proposal to tax cars based on emissions was welcomed by some on monday . " if germany went ahead with such a tax , then i 'm sure many others would follow , " eu industry commissioner günther verheugen told a german radio station . the german car industry too seemed open to the proposal .
bernd gottschalk , president of the association of german carmakers , said it would give people an additional incentive to trade in their cars for new , more efficient vehicles . daimlerchrysler , maker of mercedes cars and trucks , welcomed the proposal in principle .
a spokeswoman said changing the tax scale from engine size to emissions made sense , but added , " the tax should not have an impact on competition . " currently the flat vehicle tax in germany for a used car of just under 2 liters ' engine capacity is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- per year . environment minister sigmar gabriel said nine of the european union 's 27 nations already tax cars according to emission quality and this had been partly successful in cutting carbon-dioxide output . critics say tax is not fair however battle lines could soon be drawn over the tax change .
the revenues end up in the coffers of germany 's 16 states , none of which wants to lose income if motorists switch to less-polluting cars . state governments indicated they would wait to see what berlin proposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the car tax is unfair motorists ' clubs were critical .
the biggest , the adac , said it would only back the change if it did not lead to an increase in overall revenues .
spokesman martin remper said an emissions tax should not apply to older cars at all . another club , avd , assailed the tax as unfair , since it would apply regardless of how far or how fast a car was actually driven . " somebody who races to every intersection has got a different consumption from those who drop their speed in advance , " spokesman johannes huebner said .
" this tax would be unconstitutional . "
he said it would be fairer to tax fuel only , not cars . analysts said an outcry was likely if the tax turned out to be punitive on lower-income buyers of cheap cars while favoring rich people who can afford to buy sophisticated exhaust-reducing features . torsten albig , a finance ministry official , added that it would be almost impossible to fairly assess the exhaust quality of pre-2005 cars .
even quality labels for new cars could be contested . the european commission has already issued an emissions target for the continent 's truck and bus fleet .
by 2012 , heavy vehicles are supposed to reduce their average carbon-dioxide emissions to 130 grams per kilometer driven . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german auto industry calls eu 's co2 diet unworkable germans are regarded as environmentally friendly , but they have a penchant for gas guzzling cars , leading some to say that putting the onus to reduce emission solely on the car industry is unfair .

" the aim is not to make more money , but to do something for the environment , " he said . tiefensee pointed out that the levy would instead replace an existing tax that rises in step with the cubic capacity of a car 's engine . " overall car owners will not pay more taxes that they have until now , " said sigmar gabriel , the country 's environment minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee says german carmakers have to do more to cut emissions tiefensee said over the weekend that germany and other european carmakers had to do more to protect the environment after the head of the un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , achim steiner said in a newspaper interview that european nations were not doing enough to fight climate change and had grown complacent . " the government will be pursuing that aim and that 's why we 're going to reform the motor vehicle taxes .
the size of the engine will no longer be the determining factor but rather the impact on the environment , not only co2 but other pollutants , " tiefensee told a news conference . " those who continue to drive stink-bombs will have to pay more .
we want a system that both rewards and punishes .
i 'm sure that 'll help boost technology for cars in germany and europe that pollute less and need less fuel . " tiefensee said legislation could possibly be drafted by berlin before the year is out . germany europe 's biggest polluter germany remains europe 's biggest polluter .
though german chancellor angela merkel has vowed to make fighting climate change a priority during germany 's twin presidencies of the eu and g8 , the country 's recent track record on cutting greenhouses gases has slipped . germany had pledged to cut co2 emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 under the kyoto protocol , but is likely to fall short of its target by one-fifth .
scientists warn that if emissions are n't curbed , it will lead to dramatic climatic changers , triggering frequent droughts and floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say imposing a speed limit on germany 's autobahns is the quickest way to cut pollution critics have said that a general speed limit on highways would be the quickest way to cut emissions .
germany 's 12,000-kilometer autobahn system is unique in the world , having no limits on most of its length .
but tiefensee has strongly opposed speed limits . advocates say plan could cut pollution tiefensee 's proposal to tax cars based on emissions was welcomed by some on monday . " if germany went ahead with such a tax , then i 'm sure many others would follow , " eu industry commissioner günther verheugen told a german radio station . the german car industry too seemed open to the proposal .
bernd gottschalk , president of the association of german carmakers , said it would give people an additional incentive to trade in their cars for new , more efficient vehicles . daimlerchrysler , maker of mercedes cars and trucks , welcomed the proposal in principle .
a spokeswoman said changing the tax scale from engine size to emissions made sense , but added , " the tax should not have an impact on competition . " currently the flat vehicle tax in germany for a used car of just under 2 liters ' engine capacity is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- per year . environment minister sigmar gabriel said nine of the european union 's 27 nations already tax cars according to emission quality and this had been partly successful in cutting carbon-dioxide output . critics say tax is not fair however battle lines could soon be drawn over the tax change .
the revenues end up in the coffers of germany 's 16 states , none of which wants to lose income if motorists switch to less-polluting cars . state governments indicated they would wait to see what berlin proposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the car tax is unfair motorists ' clubs were critical .
the biggest , the adac , said it would only back the change if it did not lead to an increase in overall revenues .
spokesman martin remper said an emissions tax should not apply to older cars at all . another club , avd , assailed the tax as unfair , since it would apply regardless of how far or how fast a car was actually driven . " somebody who races to every intersection has got a different consumption from those who drop their speed in advance , " spokesman johannes huebner said .
" this tax would be unconstitutional . "
he said it would be fairer to tax fuel only , not cars . analysts said an outcry was likely if the tax turned out to be punitive on lower-income buyers of cheap cars while favoring rich people who can afford to buy sophisticated exhaust-reducing features . torsten albig , a finance ministry official , added that it would be almost impossible to fairly assess the exhaust quality of pre-2005 cars .
even quality labels for new cars could be contested . the european commission has already issued an emissions target for the continent 's truck and bus fleet .

" the aim is not to make more money , but to do something for the environment , " he said . tiefensee pointed out that the levy would instead replace an existing tax that rises in step with the cubic capacity of a car 's engine . " overall car owners will not pay more taxes that they have until now , " said sigmar gabriel , the country 's environment minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee says german carmakers have to do more to cut emissions tiefensee said over the weekend that germany and other european carmakers had to do more to protect the environment after the head of the un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , achim steiner said in a newspaper interview that european nations were not doing enough to fight climate change and had grown complacent . " the government will be pursuing that aim and that 's why we 're going to reform the motor vehicle taxes .
the size of the engine will no longer be the determining factor but rather the impact on the environment , not only co2 but other pollutants , " tiefensee told a news conference . " those who continue to drive stink-bombs will have to pay more .
we want a system that both rewards and punishes .
i 'm sure that 'll help boost technology for cars in germany and europe that pollute less and need less fuel . " tiefensee said legislation could possibly be drafted by berlin before the year is out . germany europe 's biggest polluter germany remains europe 's biggest polluter .
though german chancellor angela merkel has vowed to make fighting climate change a priority during germany 's twin presidencies of the eu and g8 , the country 's recent track record on cutting greenhouses gases has slipped . germany had pledged to cut co2 emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 under the kyoto protocol , but is likely to fall short of its target by one-fifth .
scientists warn that if emissions are n't curbed , it will lead to dramatic climatic changers , triggering frequent droughts and floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say imposing a speed limit on germany 's autobahns is the quickest way to cut pollution critics have said that a general speed limit on highways would be the quickest way to cut emissions .
germany 's 12,000-kilometer autobahn system is unique in the world , having no limits on most of its length .
but tiefensee has strongly opposed speed limits . advocates say plan could cut pollution tiefensee 's proposal to tax cars based on emissions was welcomed by some on monday . " if germany went ahead with such a tax , then i 'm sure many others would follow , " eu industry commissioner günther verheugen told a german radio station . the german car industry too seemed open to the proposal .
bernd gottschalk , president of the association of german carmakers , said it would give people an additional incentive to trade in their cars for new , more efficient vehicles . daimlerchrysler , maker of mercedes cars and trucks , welcomed the proposal in principle .
a spokeswoman said changing the tax scale from engine size to emissions made sense , but added , " the tax should not have an impact on competition . " currently the flat vehicle tax in germany for a used car of just under 2 liters ' engine capacity is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- per year . environment minister sigmar gabriel said nine of the european union 's 27 nations already tax cars according to emission quality and this had been partly successful in cutting carbon-dioxide output . critics say tax is not fair however battle lines could soon be drawn over the tax change .
the revenues end up in the coffers of germany 's 16 states , none of which wants to lose income if motorists switch to less-polluting cars . state governments indicated they would wait to see what berlin proposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the car tax is unfair motorists ' clubs were critical .
the biggest , the adac , said it would only back the change if it did not lead to an increase in overall revenues .
spokesman martin remper said an emissions tax should not apply to older cars at all . another club , avd , assailed the tax as unfair , since it would apply regardless of how far or how fast a car was actually driven . " somebody who races to every intersection has got a different consumption from those who drop their speed in advance , " spokesman johannes huebner said .
" this tax would be unconstitutional . "
he said it would be fairer to tax fuel only , not cars . analysts said an outcry was likely if the tax turned out to be punitive on lower-income buyers of cheap cars while favoring rich people who can afford to buy sophisticated exhaust-reducing features . torsten albig , a finance ministry official , added that it would be almost impossible to fairly assess the exhaust quality of pre-2005 cars .
even quality labels for new cars could be contested . the european commission has already issued an emissions target for the continent 's truck and bus fleet .
by 2012 , heavy vehicles are supposed to reduce their average carbon-dioxide emissions to 130 grams per kilometer driven . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german auto industry calls eu 's co2 diet unworkable germans are regarded as environmentally friendly , but they have a penchant for gas guzzling cars , leading some to say that putting the onus to reduce emission solely on the car industry is unfair .

star-studded as it was , the event never forgot its social conscience , says dw 's silke bartlick . every year , the entertainment spotlight turns to the german capital for the annual berlin film festival .
for 10 days every february , the city becomes the cinematic center of the world , attracting some of the biggest names in the industry .
this year 's a-list guests included actors clint eastwood , matt damon , charlotte rampling and sharon stone , as well as directors francois ozon and bille august . jennifer lopez lit up the red carpet with classic hollywood star wattage , vamping it up in glamorous contrast to her on-screen character .
in " bordertown , " la lopez plays an ambitious reporter investigating a series of mysterious murders on the mexican border .
the movie is based on true events that took place in the early 1990s in ciudad juarez , where hundreds of young women working in american factories across the border were killed .
festival director dieter kosslick even flew in several of the victims ' mothers for the press conference . it was a gesture of compassion , but one that was also designed to remind the public that this glitzy event has a political agenda - which kosslick is at constant pains to emphasize . this is the film festival with a social conscience , as both the movie selection and the choice of winners demonstrate every year .
most of the 400-off films shown during the festival serve as a comment on the state of the world and its recent history .
themes include discrimination , war , racism , poverty and social exclusion - as well as courage and personal fortitude .
they explore the seamier side of capitalism and globalization and do n't shy away from controversial topics - for example " la masseria delle allodole " -lrb- the lark farm -rrb- by italian directors paolo and vittorio taviani , a movie which tackles the armenian genocide that took place in turkey in the early 20th century . so much to worthy topics .
artistically , many of the films featured in the festival were less impressive - although they were all well attended . most movie showings were sold out , and thousands of people stood in line everyday in the hope of snaring a ticket .
people of all ages and nationalities , with one thing in common - their appreciation of intelligent cinema . the robust business going on at the european film market , taking place along side the festival , also suggests that kosslick 's much-touted " socially aware " festival does in fact put its money where its mouth is .
some 70 percent of the 618 films , including more than 400 market premieres , were festival entries .
so not only is the festival showcasing cinema from around the world , it 's also helping them get distribution . in this respect , the festival is contributing to an international cultural dialogue that continues long after the event has come to an end .
another of its strong points is its talent campus , which brings together several hundred young film-makers from around the world and gives them an opportunity to meet and learn from industry professionals .
every year , last year 's participants get to show the fruits of their labor .
it 's a resounding success - as is the entire berlin film festival . silke bartlick covers culture for dw-radio 's german program -lrb- jp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese film " tuya 's marriage " wins golden bear at berlinale the 57th berlin international film festival came to an end on saturday with the golden bear for best film going to chinese movie " tuya 's marriage .

-lrb- 17.02.2007 -rrb- a game of luck : selling movies at the berlinale festival director dieter kosslick called the 2007 event a " berlinale of stars . "

" the depiction of islam was " barefaced lies " and the float was " using negative images to seek attention , " the central council 's secretary general aiman mazyek told tuesday 's edition of the westdeutsche zeitung daily . mazyek said he asked himself what the float was meant to signal .
" this is how i read the message : ' we love our prejudices and we strengthen them with blatant lies if necessary , " ' mazyek told the paper .
" it has nothing to do with humor , " he added . carnival back to satirical themes organizers of the festivities in the carnival centers of cologne , düsseldorf and mainz had promised a return to satirical themes this year after a relatively restrained showing in 2006 in the wake of the controversy over the publication by a danish newspaper of cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french presidential candidates sarkozy and royal depicted as boxing cockerels cologne played host to the main parade , with 99 floats edging through the city , cheered on by hundreds of thousands of revellers in costume and wearing wigs . one float in cologne showed us president george w. bush being spanked by the statue of liberty while another depicted french presidential candidates segolene royal and nicolas sarkozy as boxing cockerels . carnival is a tradition stemming from catholic regions in the west and south of germany , but it is rapidly being adopted by cities in the north and east . the processions take place on what is known as rose monday , although opinions differ on the origin of the term . some say it is derived from the word " rhosen " from the rhineland dialect , meaning dashing or romping .

" the depiction of islam was " barefaced lies " and the float was " using negative images to seek attention , " the central council 's secretary general aiman mazyek told tuesday 's edition of the westdeutsche zeitung daily . mazyek said he asked himself what the float was meant to signal .
" this is how i read the message : ' we love our prejudices and we strengthen them with blatant lies if necessary , " ' mazyek told the paper .
" it has nothing to do with humor , " he added . carnival back to satirical themes organizers of the festivities in the carnival centers of cologne , düsseldorf and mainz had promised a return to satirical themes this year after a relatively restrained showing in 2006 in the wake of the controversy over the publication by a danish newspaper of cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french presidential candidates sarkozy and royal depicted as boxing cockerels cologne played host to the main parade , with 99 floats edging through the city , cheered on by hundreds of thousands of revellers in costume and wearing wigs . one float in cologne showed us president george w. bush being spanked by the statue of liberty while another depicted french presidential candidates segolene royal and nicolas sarkozy as boxing cockerels . carnival is a tradition stemming from catholic regions in the west and south of germany , but it is rapidly being adopted by cities in the north and east . the processions take place on what is known as rose monday , although opinions differ on the origin of the term . some say it is derived from the word " rhosen " from the rhineland dialect , meaning dashing or romping .
others link it to rose sunday , so-called since the middle ages because the pope traditionally presented a golden rose to a worthy citizen on that day . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel to european parliament : " europe 's soul is tolerance " french satire mag in court over reprinted mohammad cartoons in a civil action , muslim groups have taken a french satire magazine to court for reprinting the controversial danish cartoons of the prophet mohammad .

" the atmosphere is becoming more and more tense , " a union source said friday as the release of the plan approached . eads , which owns airbus , is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close political ties .
the remaining 42 percent is publicly held . workers unnerved by possible cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker 's union wants employees to mobilize against the restructuring program the cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " that has unnerved workers in both france and germany , which hold major stakes in eads . airbus , employing about 56,000 people , has said the restructuring will entail job losses , carried out according to age considerations as well as through a reduction in part-time and short-term employment . the manufacturer hopes to save 30 percent in operating costs .
it is expected to tighten the management structure of subsidiaries in france , germany , spain and britain and to streamline certain administrative functions . a greater reliance is also foreseen on sub-contractors for activities that are not part of the core airbus operation .
sources have said the plan would reduce internal production from 65 percent to 50 percent . jobs at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois is facing pressure from french and german political leaders in addition , some of the 16 european sites could be closed or sold under changes in the distribution of production tasks in europe . the french business newspaper les echos reported on monday that airbus could cut up to 12,000 jobs , with 3,000-4,000 in both france and germany . la tribune daily said the plan could affect up to 10,000 jobs and that three factories would close : meaulte in france and varel and nordenham in germany . job losses are a particularly sensitive issue in france in the run up to presidential elections in april and may this year . the french cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " . german workers , who fear they will bear the brunt of the reorganization , are especially anxious about the fate of a plant in hamburg , which has been held partially responsible for production problems with the a380 . unconfirmed reports have said some of the work done on the a380 could be transferred to airbus plants in toulouse , southern france , which would also be responsible for assembling the new a350 long-haul carrier . in exchange the hamburg factory would take on assembling the single-aisle a320 . politicians applying pressure in december , airbus chief gallois said when launching the 10-billion-euro a350xwb project that it depended on application of power 8 .
airbus is counting on cost savings to help finance the development and manufacturing costs of the aircraft , which is destined to compete with the successful boeing 787 dreamliner . the plan is fraught with delicate political considerations , with german and french national interests bound up in its implementation . german economy minister michael glos has vowed to do everything possible to protect the future of german production sites and has hinted that germany might consider withdrawing some of its defense contracts with eads , the airbus parent . in a veiled threat illustrating the political pressure placed on eads and airbus , german economy minister michael glos warned at the beginning of the month that the country would " review " its contracts with eads if job cuts hit german workers more workers in other countries . gallois has meanwhile had to defend the project in meetings with french prime minister dominique de villepin and german chancellor angela merkel , who have demanded balanced treatment for all parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program airbus may be looking for companies to take over production sites threatened with closure under a major restructuring plan , said german state leader christian wulff , after talks with execs from airbus parent firm eads .
-lrb- 13.02.2007 -rrb- eads : cutting defense contracts will cost more german jobs cutting defence contracts in retaliation for german jobs losses would simply hurt more german workers , co-chairman of the european aeronautics defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- thomas enders told berlin tuesday .

the reason ?
the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .
this is when germany 's " baby-boomer " generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate . " the shortfall in the work-place will put a brake on the economy , " plünnecke said . france gets it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose side is ursula von der leyen on ?
to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .
" but i want to emphasize that parents who stay home with their kids from birth until the age of three should not be regarded as belonging to the last century .

the reason ?
the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .
this is when germany 's " baby-boomer " generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate . " the shortfall in the work-place will put a brake on the economy , " plünnecke said . france gets it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose side is ursula von der leyen on ?
to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .

" the atmosphere is becoming more and more tense , " a union source said friday as the release of the plan approached . eads , which owns airbus , is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close political ties .
the remaining 42 percent is publicly held . workers unnerved by possible cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker 's union wants employees to mobilize against the restructuring program the cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " that has unnerved workers in both france and germany , which hold major stakes in eads . airbus , employing about 56,000 people , has said the restructuring will entail job losses , carried out according to age considerations as well as through a reduction in part-time and short-term employment . the manufacturer hopes to save 30 percent in operating costs .
it is expected to tighten the management structure of subsidiaries in france , germany , spain and britain and to streamline certain administrative functions . a greater reliance is also foreseen on sub-contractors for activities that are not part of the core airbus operation .
sources have said the plan would reduce internal production from 65 percent to 50 percent . jobs at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois is facing pressure from french and german political leaders in addition , some of the 16 european sites could be closed or sold under changes in the distribution of production tasks in europe . the french business newspaper les echos reported on monday that airbus could cut up to 12,000 jobs , with 3,000-4,000 in both france and germany . la tribune daily said the plan could affect up to 10,000 jobs and that three factories would close : meaulte in france and varel and nordenham in germany . job losses are a particularly sensitive issue in france in the run up to presidential elections in april and may this year . the french cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " . german workers , who fear they will bear the brunt of the reorganization , are especially anxious about the fate of a plant in hamburg , which has been held partially responsible for production problems with the a380 . unconfirmed reports have said some of the work done on the a380 could be transferred to airbus plants in toulouse , southern france , which would also be responsible for assembling the new a350 long-haul carrier . in exchange the hamburg factory would take on assembling the single-aisle a320 . politicians applying pressure in december , airbus chief gallois said when launching the 10-billion-euro a350xwb project that it depended on application of power 8 .
airbus is counting on cost savings to help finance the development and manufacturing costs of the aircraft , which is destined to compete with the successful boeing 787 dreamliner . the plan is fraught with delicate political considerations , with german and french national interests bound up in its implementation . german economy minister michael glos has vowed to do everything possible to protect the future of german production sites and has hinted that germany might consider withdrawing some of its defense contracts with eads , the airbus parent . in a veiled threat illustrating the political pressure placed on eads and airbus , german economy minister michael glos warned at the beginning of the month that the country would " review " its contracts with eads if job cuts hit german workers more workers in other countries . gallois has meanwhile had to defend the project in meetings with french prime minister dominique de villepin and german chancellor angela merkel , who have demanded balanced treatment for all parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program airbus may be looking for companies to take over production sites threatened with closure under a major restructuring plan , said german state leader christian wulff , after talks with execs from airbus parent firm eads .
-lrb- 13.02.2007 -rrb- eads : cutting defense contracts will cost more german jobs cutting defence contracts in retaliation for german jobs losses would simply hurt more german workers , co-chairman of the european aeronautics defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- thomas enders told berlin tuesday .

many in europe , however , remain concerned about the country 's spotty human rights record . meeting eu demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aliev was in berlin last week looking for germany to invest in his country aliev said during a visit to germany last week that his oil-rich nation needed another five years to raise human-rights standards to match levels required under good-neighbor agreements with european states . germany , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , played an important role in tightening the 27-member bloc 's relations with azerbaijan . european union officials vowed last year to forge stronger links with suppliers of vital oil and gas in a bid to ease the bloc 's current dependence on energy-rich but increasingly assertive russia . the eu is backing westward gas pipelines from the caspian sea fields via ukraine and turkey .
a line , code-named nabucco , is to be commissioned by 2011 .
it would pick up gas from turkish pipelines and shift it to western europe 's grid via bulgaria and romania . during his trip , steinmeier is also scheduled to confer with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and armenian prime minister andranik margarjan . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to visit former soviet republics foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier began a series of visits to the southern caucasus states of azerbaijan , georgia and armenia on sunday to discuss energy issues with the oil-rich former soviet republics .

star-studded as it was , the event never forgot its social conscience , says dw 's silke bartlick . every year , the entertainment spotlight turns to the german capital for the annual berlin film festival .
for 10 days every february , the city becomes the cinematic center of the world , attracting some of the biggest names in the industry .
this year 's a-list guests included actors clint eastwood , matt damon , charlotte rampling and sharon stone , as well as directors francois ozon and bille august . jennifer lopez lit up the red carpet with classic hollywood star wattage , vamping it up in glamorous contrast to her on-screen character .
in " bordertown , " la lopez plays an ambitious reporter investigating a series of mysterious murders on the mexican border .
the movie is based on true events that took place in the early 1990s in ciudad juarez , where hundreds of young women working in american factories across the border were killed .
festival director dieter kosslick even flew in several of the victims ' mothers for the press conference . it was a gesture of compassion , but one that was also designed to remind the public that this glitzy event has a political agenda - which kosslick is at constant pains to emphasize . this is the film festival with a social conscience , as both the movie selection and the choice of winners demonstrate every year .
most of the 400-off films shown during the festival serve as a comment on the state of the world and its recent history .
themes include discrimination , war , racism , poverty and social exclusion - as well as courage and personal fortitude .
they explore the seamier side of capitalism and globalization and do n't shy away from controversial topics - for example " la masseria delle allodole " -lrb- the lark farm -rrb- by italian directors paolo and vittorio taviani , a movie which tackles the armenian genocide that took place in turkey in the early 20th century . so much to worthy topics .
artistically , many of the films featured in the festival were less impressive - although they were all well attended . most movie showings were sold out , and thousands of people stood in line everyday in the hope of snaring a ticket .
people of all ages and nationalities , with one thing in common - their appreciation of intelligent cinema . the robust business going on at the european film market , taking place along side the festival , also suggests that kosslick 's much-touted " socially aware " festival does in fact put its money where its mouth is .
some 70 percent of the 618 films , including more than 400 market premieres , were festival entries .
so not only is the festival showcasing cinema from around the world , it 's also helping them get distribution . in this respect , the festival is contributing to an international cultural dialogue that continues long after the event has come to an end .
another of its strong points is its talent campus , which brings together several hundred young film-makers from around the world and gives them an opportunity to meet and learn from industry professionals .
every year , last year 's participants get to show the fruits of their labor .

caviar gets served atop white chocolate or warm ice cream .
if a dish sounds like it defies the laws of nature , it 's likely a matter of molecular gastronomy , an approach to cooking that has entered the mainstream over the past few years . the most well known practitioner of this innovative way of cooking is spain 's three-star chef ferran adria .
at the beginning of the new millennium he grabbed headlines with creations such as apple caviar , parmesan spaghetti and blackberry-tobacco sorbet . a drizzle of science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : appearance is important german cuisine is also receiving a molecular twist as more chefs turn to physics and chemistry to create unusual dining experiences .
one practitioner of molecular gastronomy is the düsseldorf-based chef richard nicolaus . his restaurant , km 747 , is located in a quiet area near the rhine river .
the kitchen is a far cry from the typical mad scientist 's laboratory with nary a test tube or microscope in sight .
the science begins when nicolaus starts cooking . " we 're going to make a satay skewer from tuna fish , and what 's different is that the tuna fish will be fried in a sugar water mixture at 120 degrees -lrb- celsius -rrb- , " nicolaus said . normally , the tuna would be cooked in oil , leaving it fatty .
by using a special type of sugar that heats like oil , nicolaus can cook the tuna and have it ready to serve in 10 seconds . " from the outside it 's almost crispy , " he said .
" i 'll drizzle a little with lemon over it and then season it with a fish-vegetable mixture . " the tuna fish creation is only one of many .
guests can also try tomato jelly or cucumber foam .
for each dish on the menu , nicolaus uses a different trick from the molecular cooking world .
sauces are transformed into foam .
meat is cooked in a vacuum .
with the help of new substances he creates completely new consistencies . inventing new tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cooks are starting to think - and act - like chemists molecular cooking is pure physics , nicolaus said . " people nowadays want to experience new things , " he said .
" they want to discover new tastes and it happens that science brings the possibility for new products like , for example , jellies or chemicals . " the düsseldorf native came to molecular cooking via mechanical engineering .
for 10 years he 'd cooked as a hobby .
but when he got the chance , he gladly exchanged a drawing table and compass for an oven and ladle and his background in mechanical engineering made it feel natural to experiment in the kitchen with the design and form of his culinary creations . the menu at km 747 does n't make it obvious that the chef is using a radically different method to prepare food .
the ingredients sound normal : smoked breast of duck , curry soup , grilled perch .
the surprise comes dish is served , said tanja schuch . " for me , the combination is important , " schuch said .
" a pea-mint purée , i have never eaten that way .
but when you taste it , it 's absolutely a culinary delight , and it 's obviously also visually interesting . " guests often ask nicolaus why , for example , the spinach on their plate forms a small tower instead of looking like its normal squishy self .
they want to know how he gets the duck breast so tender and how he made the seafood risotto .
nicolaus said he chats willingly about his cooking concept . but he does n't give diners much hope that they can recreate his food creations .
nicolaus spends a lot of time experimenting and honing his specialized techniques that , like all excellent cooking , require more effort than simply mixing ingredients together . nadja baeva -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de have your cake and eat it too in germany , enjoying coffee and cake in the afternoon is n't just for grannies .

" the atmosphere is becoming more and more tense , " a union source said friday as the release of the plan approached . eads , which owns airbus , is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close political ties .
the remaining 42 percent is publicly held . workers unnerved by possible cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker 's union wants employees to mobilize against the restructuring program the cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " that has unnerved workers in both france and germany , which hold major stakes in eads . airbus , employing about 56,000 people , has said the restructuring will entail job losses , carried out according to age considerations as well as through a reduction in part-time and short-term employment . the manufacturer hopes to save 30 percent in operating costs .
it is expected to tighten the management structure of subsidiaries in france , germany , spain and britain and to streamline certain administrative functions . a greater reliance is also foreseen on sub-contractors for activities that are not part of the core airbus operation .
sources have said the plan would reduce internal production from 65 percent to 50 percent . jobs at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois is facing pressure from french and german political leaders in addition , some of the 16 european sites could be closed or sold under changes in the distribution of production tasks in europe . the french business newspaper les echos reported on monday that airbus could cut up to 12,000 jobs , with 3,000-4,000 in both france and germany . la tribune daily said the plan could affect up to 10,000 jobs and that three factories would close : meaulte in france and varel and nordenham in germany . job losses are a particularly sensitive issue in france in the run up to presidential elections in april and may this year . the french cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " . german workers , who fear they will bear the brunt of the reorganization , are especially anxious about the fate of a plant in hamburg , which has been held partially responsible for production problems with the a380 . unconfirmed reports have said some of the work done on the a380 could be transferred to airbus plants in toulouse , southern france , which would also be responsible for assembling the new a350 long-haul carrier . in exchange the hamburg factory would take on assembling the single-aisle a320 . politicians applying pressure in december , airbus chief gallois said when launching the 10-billion-euro a350xwb project that it depended on application of power 8 .
airbus is counting on cost savings to help finance the development and manufacturing costs of the aircraft , which is destined to compete with the successful boeing 787 dreamliner . the plan is fraught with delicate political considerations , with german and french national interests bound up in its implementation . german economy minister michael glos has vowed to do everything possible to protect the future of german production sites and has hinted that germany might consider withdrawing some of its defense contracts with eads , the airbus parent . in a veiled threat illustrating the political pressure placed on eads and airbus , german economy minister michael glos warned at the beginning of the month that the country would " review " its contracts with eads if job cuts hit german workers more workers in other countries . gallois has meanwhile had to defend the project in meetings with french prime minister dominique de villepin and german chancellor angela merkel , who have demanded balanced treatment for all parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program airbus may be looking for companies to take over production sites threatened with closure under a major restructuring plan , said german state leader christian wulff , after talks with execs from airbus parent firm eads .

" the atmosphere is becoming more and more tense , " a union source said friday as the release of the plan approached . eads , which owns airbus , is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close political ties .
the remaining 42 percent is publicly held . workers unnerved by possible cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker 's union wants employees to mobilize against the restructuring program the cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " that has unnerved workers in both france and germany , which hold major stakes in eads . airbus , employing about 56,000 people , has said the restructuring will entail job losses , carried out according to age considerations as well as through a reduction in part-time and short-term employment . the manufacturer hopes to save 30 percent in operating costs .
it is expected to tighten the management structure of subsidiaries in france , germany , spain and britain and to streamline certain administrative functions . a greater reliance is also foreseen on sub-contractors for activities that are not part of the core airbus operation .
sources have said the plan would reduce internal production from 65 percent to 50 percent . jobs at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois is facing pressure from french and german political leaders in addition , some of the 16 european sites could be closed or sold under changes in the distribution of production tasks in europe . the french business newspaper les echos reported on monday that airbus could cut up to 12,000 jobs , with 3,000-4,000 in both france and germany . la tribune daily said the plan could affect up to 10,000 jobs and that three factories would close : meaulte in france and varel and nordenham in germany . job losses are a particularly sensitive issue in france in the run up to presidential elections in april and may this year . the french cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " . german workers , who fear they will bear the brunt of the reorganization , are especially anxious about the fate of a plant in hamburg , which has been held partially responsible for production problems with the a380 . unconfirmed reports have said some of the work done on the a380 could be transferred to airbus plants in toulouse , southern france , which would also be responsible for assembling the new a350 long-haul carrier . in exchange the hamburg factory would take on assembling the single-aisle a320 . politicians applying pressure in december , airbus chief gallois said when launching the 10-billion-euro a350xwb project that it depended on application of power 8 .
airbus is counting on cost savings to help finance the development and manufacturing costs of the aircraft , which is destined to compete with the successful boeing 787 dreamliner . the plan is fraught with delicate political considerations , with german and french national interests bound up in its implementation . german economy minister michael glos has vowed to do everything possible to protect the future of german production sites and has hinted that germany might consider withdrawing some of its defense contracts with eads , the airbus parent . in a veiled threat illustrating the political pressure placed on eads and airbus , german economy minister michael glos warned at the beginning of the month that the country would " review " its contracts with eads if job cuts hit german workers more workers in other countries . gallois has meanwhile had to defend the project in meetings with french prime minister dominique de villepin and german chancellor angela merkel , who have demanded balanced treatment for all parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program airbus may be looking for companies to take over production sites threatened with closure under a major restructuring plan , said german state leader christian wulff , after talks with execs from airbus parent firm eads .

the reason ?
the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .
this is when germany 's " baby-boomer " generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate . " the shortfall in the work-place will put a brake on the economy , " plünnecke said . france gets it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose side is ursula von der leyen on ?
to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .
" but i want to emphasize that parents who stay home with their kids from birth until the age of three should not be regarded as belonging to the last century .

last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .
" but i want to emphasize that parents who stay home with their kids from birth until the age of three should not be regarded as belonging to the last century .

if a dish sounds like it defies the laws of nature , it 's likely a matter of molecular gastronomy , an approach to cooking that has entered the mainstream over the past few years . the most well known practitioner of this innovative way of cooking is spain 's three-star chef ferran adria .
at the beginning of the new millennium he grabbed headlines with creations such as apple caviar , parmesan spaghetti and blackberry-tobacco sorbet . a drizzle of science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : appearance is important german cuisine is also receiving a molecular twist as more chefs turn to physics and chemistry to create unusual dining experiences .
one practitioner of molecular gastronomy is the düsseldorf-based chef richard nicolaus . his restaurant , km 747 , is located in a quiet area near the rhine river .
the kitchen is a far cry from the typical mad scientist 's laboratory with nary a test tube or microscope in sight .
the science begins when nicolaus starts cooking . " we 're going to make a satay skewer from tuna fish , and what 's different is that the tuna fish will be fried in a sugar water mixture at 120 degrees -lrb- celsius -rrb- , " nicolaus said . normally , the tuna would be cooked in oil , leaving it fatty .
by using a special type of sugar that heats like oil , nicolaus can cook the tuna and have it ready to serve in 10 seconds . " from the outside it 's almost crispy , " he said .
" i 'll drizzle a little with lemon over it and then season it with a fish-vegetable mixture . " the tuna fish creation is only one of many .
guests can also try tomato jelly or cucumber foam .

" people nowadays want to experience new things , " he said .
" they want to discover new tastes and it happens that science brings the possibility for new products like , for example , jellies or chemicals . " the düsseldorf native came to molecular cooking via mechanical engineering .
for 10 years he 'd cooked as a hobby .
but when he got the chance , he gladly exchanged a drawing table and compass for an oven and ladle and his background in mechanical engineering made it feel natural to experiment in the kitchen with the design and form of his culinary creations . the menu at km 747 does n't make it obvious that the chef is using a radically different method to prepare food .
the ingredients sound normal : smoked breast of duck , curry soup , grilled perch .
the surprise comes dish is served , said tanja schuch . " for me , the combination is important , " schuch said .
" a pea-mint purée , i have never eaten that way .
but when you taste it , it 's absolutely a culinary delight , and it 's obviously also visually interesting . " guests often ask nicolaus why , for example , the spinach on their plate forms a small tower instead of looking like its normal squishy self .
they want to know how he gets the duck breast so tender and how he made the seafood risotto .
nicolaus said he chats willingly about his cooking concept . but he does n't give diners much hope that they can recreate his food creations .

one practitioner of molecular gastronomy is the düsseldorf-based chef richard nicolaus . his restaurant , km 747 , is located in a quiet area near the rhine river .
the kitchen is a far cry from the typical mad scientist 's laboratory with nary a test tube or microscope in sight .
the science begins when nicolaus starts cooking . " we 're going to make a satay skewer from tuna fish , and what 's different is that the tuna fish will be fried in a sugar water mixture at 120 degrees -lrb- celsius -rrb- , " nicolaus said . normally , the tuna would be cooked in oil , leaving it fatty .
by using a special type of sugar that heats like oil , nicolaus can cook the tuna and have it ready to serve in 10 seconds . " from the outside it 's almost crispy , " he said .
" i 'll drizzle a little with lemon over it and then season it with a fish-vegetable mixture . " the tuna fish creation is only one of many .
guests can also try tomato jelly or cucumber foam .

for 10 years he 'd cooked as a hobby .
but when he got the chance , he gladly exchanged a drawing table and compass for an oven and ladle and his background in mechanical engineering made it feel natural to experiment in the kitchen with the design and form of his culinary creations . the menu at km 747 does n't make it obvious that the chef is using a radically different method to prepare food .
the ingredients sound normal : smoked breast of duck , curry soup , grilled perch .
the surprise comes dish is served , said tanja schuch . " for me , the combination is important , " schuch said .
" a pea-mint purée , i have never eaten that way .
but when you taste it , it 's absolutely a culinary delight , and it 's obviously also visually interesting . " guests often ask nicolaus why , for example , the spinach on their plate forms a small tower instead of looking like its normal squishy self .
they want to know how he gets the duck breast so tender and how he made the seafood risotto .
nicolaus said he chats willingly about his cooking concept . but he does n't give diners much hope that they can recreate his food creations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the clock is ticking eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions germany in top five countries fighting climate change germany boosts investment in climate change research interviews : the united nations and climate change environment -pipe- 19.02.2007 german plan to tax cars on emissions gets wary nod großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who drive polluting cars will be penalized under the proposed plan plans by the german government to tax cars based on emissions instead of engine size in a bid to encourage carmakers to design " greener " cars have met with a cautious welcome . german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee insisted monday that a planned flat tax on cars based on emissions would not impose a financial burden on car owners . " the aim is not to make more money , but to do something for the environment , " he said . tiefensee pointed out that the levy would instead replace an existing tax that rises in step with the cubic capacity of a car 's engine . " overall car owners will not pay more taxes that they have until now , " said sigmar gabriel , the country 's environment minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee says german carmakers have to do more to cut emissions tiefensee said over the weekend that germany and other european carmakers had to do more to protect the environment after the head of the un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , achim steiner said in a newspaper interview that european nations were not doing enough to fight climate change and had grown complacent . " the government will be pursuing that aim and that 's why we 're going to reform the motor vehicle taxes .
the size of the engine will no longer be the determining factor but rather the impact on the environment , not only co2 but other pollutants , " tiefensee told a news conference . " those who continue to drive stink-bombs will have to pay more .
we want a system that both rewards and punishes .
i 'm sure that 'll help boost technology for cars in germany and europe that pollute less and need less fuel . " tiefensee said legislation could possibly be drafted by berlin before the year is out . germany europe 's biggest polluter germany remains europe 's biggest polluter .
though german chancellor angela merkel has vowed to make fighting climate change a priority during germany 's twin presidencies of the eu and g8 , the country 's recent track record on cutting greenhouses gases has slipped . germany had pledged to cut co2 emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 under the kyoto protocol , but is likely to fall short of its target by one-fifth .
scientists warn that if emissions are n't curbed , it will lead to dramatic climatic changers , triggering frequent droughts and floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say imposing a speed limit on germany 's autobahns is the quickest way to cut pollution critics have said that a general speed limit on highways would be the quickest way to cut emissions .
germany 's 12,000-kilometer autobahn system is unique in the world , having no limits on most of its length .
but tiefensee has strongly opposed speed limits . advocates say plan could cut pollution tiefensee 's proposal to tax cars based on emissions was welcomed by some on monday . " if germany went ahead with such a tax , then i 'm sure many others would follow , " eu industry commissioner günther verheugen told a german radio station . the german car industry too seemed open to the proposal .
bernd gottschalk , president of the association of german carmakers , said it would give people an additional incentive to trade in their cars for new , more efficient vehicles . daimlerchrysler , maker of mercedes cars and trucks , welcomed the proposal in principle .
a spokeswoman said changing the tax scale from engine size to emissions made sense , but added , " the tax should not have an impact on competition . " currently the flat vehicle tax in germany for a used car of just under 2 liters ' engine capacity is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- per year . environment minister sigmar gabriel said nine of the european union 's 27 nations already tax cars according to emission quality and this had been partly successful in cutting carbon-dioxide output . critics say tax is not fair however battle lines could soon be drawn over the tax change .
the revenues end up in the coffers of germany 's 16 states , none of which wants to lose income if motorists switch to less-polluting cars . state governments indicated they would wait to see what berlin proposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the car tax is unfair motorists ' clubs were critical .
the biggest , the adac , said it would only back the change if it did not lead to an increase in overall revenues .
spokesman martin remper said an emissions tax should not apply to older cars at all . another club , avd , assailed the tax as unfair , since it would apply regardless of how far or how fast a car was actually driven . " somebody who races to every intersection has got a different consumption from those who drop their speed in advance , " spokesman johannes huebner said .
" this tax would be unconstitutional . "

" the aim is not to make more money , but to do something for the environment , " he said . tiefensee pointed out that the levy would instead replace an existing tax that rises in step with the cubic capacity of a car 's engine . " overall car owners will not pay more taxes that they have until now , " said sigmar gabriel , the country 's environment minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee says german carmakers have to do more to cut emissions tiefensee said over the weekend that germany and other european carmakers had to do more to protect the environment after the head of the un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , achim steiner said in a newspaper interview that european nations were not doing enough to fight climate change and had grown complacent . " the government will be pursuing that aim and that 's why we 're going to reform the motor vehicle taxes .
the size of the engine will no longer be the determining factor but rather the impact on the environment , not only co2 but other pollutants , " tiefensee told a news conference . " those who continue to drive stink-bombs will have to pay more .
we want a system that both rewards and punishes .
i 'm sure that 'll help boost technology for cars in germany and europe that pollute less and need less fuel . " tiefensee said legislation could possibly be drafted by berlin before the year is out . germany europe 's biggest polluter germany remains europe 's biggest polluter .
though german chancellor angela merkel has vowed to make fighting climate change a priority during germany 's twin presidencies of the eu and g8 , the country 's recent track record on cutting greenhouses gases has slipped . germany had pledged to cut co2 emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 under the kyoto protocol , but is likely to fall short of its target by one-fifth .
scientists warn that if emissions are n't curbed , it will lead to dramatic climatic changers , triggering frequent droughts and floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say imposing a speed limit on germany 's autobahns is the quickest way to cut pollution critics have said that a general speed limit on highways would be the quickest way to cut emissions .
germany 's 12,000-kilometer autobahn system is unique in the world , having no limits on most of its length .
but tiefensee has strongly opposed speed limits . advocates say plan could cut pollution tiefensee 's proposal to tax cars based on emissions was welcomed by some on monday . " if germany went ahead with such a tax , then i 'm sure many others would follow , " eu industry commissioner günther verheugen told a german radio station . the german car industry too seemed open to the proposal .
bernd gottschalk , president of the association of german carmakers , said it would give people an additional incentive to trade in their cars for new , more efficient vehicles . daimlerchrysler , maker of mercedes cars and trucks , welcomed the proposal in principle .
a spokeswoman said changing the tax scale from engine size to emissions made sense , but added , " the tax should not have an impact on competition . " currently the flat vehicle tax in germany for a used car of just under 2 liters ' engine capacity is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- per year . environment minister sigmar gabriel said nine of the european union 's 27 nations already tax cars according to emission quality and this had been partly successful in cutting carbon-dioxide output . critics say tax is not fair however battle lines could soon be drawn over the tax change .
the revenues end up in the coffers of germany 's 16 states , none of which wants to lose income if motorists switch to less-polluting cars . state governments indicated they would wait to see what berlin proposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the car tax is unfair motorists ' clubs were critical .
the biggest , the adac , said it would only back the change if it did not lead to an increase in overall revenues .
spokesman martin remper said an emissions tax should not apply to older cars at all . another club , avd , assailed the tax as unfair , since it would apply regardless of how far or how fast a car was actually driven .

" overall car owners will not pay more taxes that they have until now , " said sigmar gabriel , the country 's environment minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee says german carmakers have to do more to cut emissions tiefensee said over the weekend that germany and other european carmakers had to do more to protect the environment after the head of the un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , achim steiner said in a newspaper interview that european nations were not doing enough to fight climate change and had grown complacent .

" the atmosphere is becoming more and more tense , " a union source said friday as the release of the plan approached . eads , which owns airbus , is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close political ties .
the remaining 42 percent is publicly held . workers unnerved by possible cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker 's union wants employees to mobilize against the restructuring program the cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " that has unnerved workers in both france and germany , which hold major stakes in eads . airbus , employing about 56,000 people , has said the restructuring will entail job losses , carried out according to age considerations as well as through a reduction in part-time and short-term employment . the manufacturer hopes to save 30 percent in operating costs .

it is expected to tighten the management structure of subsidiaries in france , germany , spain and britain and to streamline certain administrative functions . a greater reliance is also foreseen on sub-contractors for activities that are not part of the core airbus operation .

airbus is counting on cost savings to help finance the development and manufacturing costs of the aircraft , which is destined to compete with the successful boeing 787 dreamliner . the plan is fraught with delicate political considerations , with german and french national interests bound up in its implementation . german economy minister michael glos has vowed to do everything possible to protect the future of german production sites and has hinted that germany might consider withdrawing some of its defense contracts with eads , the airbus parent . in a veiled threat illustrating the political pressure placed on eads and airbus , german economy minister michael glos warned at the beginning of the month that the country would " review " its contracts with eads if job cuts hit german workers more workers in other countries . gallois has meanwhile had to defend the project in meetings with french prime minister dominique de villepin and german chancellor angela merkel , who have demanded balanced treatment for all parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program airbus may be looking for companies to take over production sites threatened with closure under a major restructuring plan , said german state leader christian wulff , after talks with execs from airbus parent firm eads .

" the atmosphere is becoming more and more tense , " a union source said friday as the release of the plan approached . eads , which owns airbus , is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close political ties .
the remaining 42 percent is publicly held . workers unnerved by possible cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker 's union wants employees to mobilize against the restructuring program the cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " that has unnerved workers in both france and germany , which hold major stakes in eads . airbus , employing about 56,000 people , has said the restructuring will entail job losses , carried out according to age considerations as well as through a reduction in part-time and short-term employment . the manufacturer hopes to save 30 percent in operating costs .
it is expected to tighten the management structure of subsidiaries in france , germany , spain and britain and to streamline certain administrative functions . a greater reliance is also foreseen on sub-contractors for activities that are not part of the core airbus operation .
sources have said the plan would reduce internal production from 65 percent to 50 percent . jobs at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois is facing pressure from french and german political leaders in addition , some of the 16 european sites could be closed or sold under changes in the distribution of production tasks in europe . the french business newspaper les echos reported on monday that airbus could cut up to 12,000 jobs , with 3,000-4,000 in both france and germany . la tribune daily said the plan could affect up to 10,000 jobs and that three factories would close : meaulte in france and varel and nordenham in germany . job losses are a particularly sensitive issue in france in the run up to presidential elections in april and may this year . the french cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " . german workers , who fear they will bear the brunt of the reorganization , are especially anxious about the fate of a plant in hamburg , which has been held partially responsible for production problems with the a380 . unconfirmed reports have said some of the work done on the a380 could be transferred to airbus plants in toulouse , southern france , which would also be responsible for assembling the new a350 long-haul carrier . in exchange the hamburg factory would take on assembling the single-aisle a320 . politicians applying pressure in december , airbus chief gallois said when launching the 10-billion-euro a350xwb project that it depended on application of power 8 .
airbus is counting on cost savings to help finance the development and manufacturing costs of the aircraft , which is destined to compete with the successful boeing 787 dreamliner . the plan is fraught with delicate political considerations , with german and french national interests bound up in its implementation . german economy minister michael glos has vowed to do everything possible to protect the future of german production sites and has hinted that germany might consider withdrawing some of its defense contracts with eads , the airbus parent . in a veiled threat illustrating the political pressure placed on eads and airbus , german economy minister michael glos warned at the beginning of the month that the country would " review " its contracts with eads if job cuts hit german workers more workers in other countries . gallois has meanwhile had to defend the project in meetings with french prime minister dominique de villepin and german chancellor angela merkel , who have demanded balanced treatment for all parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program airbus may be looking for companies to take over production sites threatened with closure under a major restructuring plan , said german state leader christian wulff , after talks with execs from airbus parent firm eads .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the clock is ticking eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions germany in top five countries fighting climate change germany boosts investment in climate change research interviews : the united nations and climate change environment -pipe- 19.02.2007 german plan to tax cars on emissions gets wary nod großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who drive polluting cars will be penalized under the proposed plan plans by the german government to tax cars based on emissions instead of engine size in a bid to encourage carmakers to design " greener " cars have met with a cautious welcome . german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee insisted monday that a planned flat tax on cars based on emissions would not impose a financial burden on car owners . " the aim is not to make more money , but to do something for the environment , " he said . tiefensee pointed out that the levy would instead replace an existing tax that rises in step with the cubic capacity of a car 's engine . " overall car owners will not pay more taxes that they have until now , " said sigmar gabriel , the country 's environment minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee says german carmakers have to do more to cut emissions tiefensee said over the weekend that germany and other european carmakers had to do more to protect the environment after the head of the un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , achim steiner said in a newspaper interview that european nations were not doing enough to fight climate change and had grown complacent . " the government will be pursuing that aim and that 's why we 're going to reform the motor vehicle taxes .
the size of the engine will no longer be the determining factor but rather the impact on the environment , not only co2 but other pollutants , " tiefensee told a news conference . " those who continue to drive stink-bombs will have to pay more .
we want a system that both rewards and punishes .
i 'm sure that 'll help boost technology for cars in germany and europe that pollute less and need less fuel . " tiefensee said legislation could possibly be drafted by berlin before the year is out . germany europe 's biggest polluter germany remains europe 's biggest polluter .
though german chancellor angela merkel has vowed to make fighting climate change a priority during germany 's twin presidencies of the eu and g8 , the country 's recent track record on cutting greenhouses gases has slipped . germany had pledged to cut co2 emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 under the kyoto protocol , but is likely to fall short of its target by one-fifth .
scientists warn that if emissions are n't curbed , it will lead to dramatic climatic changers , triggering frequent droughts and floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say imposing a speed limit on germany 's autobahns is the quickest way to cut pollution critics have said that a general speed limit on highways would be the quickest way to cut emissions .
germany 's 12,000-kilometer autobahn system is unique in the world , having no limits on most of its length .
but tiefensee has strongly opposed speed limits . advocates say plan could cut pollution tiefensee 's proposal to tax cars based on emissions was welcomed by some on monday . " if germany went ahead with such a tax , then i 'm sure many others would follow , " eu industry commissioner günther verheugen told a german radio station . the german car industry too seemed open to the proposal .
bernd gottschalk , president of the association of german carmakers , said it would give people an additional incentive to trade in their cars for new , more efficient vehicles . daimlerchrysler , maker of mercedes cars and trucks , welcomed the proposal in principle .
a spokeswoman said changing the tax scale from engine size to emissions made sense , but added , " the tax should not have an impact on competition . " currently the flat vehicle tax in germany for a used car of just under 2 liters ' engine capacity is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- per year . environment minister sigmar gabriel said nine of the european union 's 27 nations already tax cars according to emission quality and this had been partly successful in cutting carbon-dioxide output . critics say tax is not fair however battle lines could soon be drawn over the tax change .
the revenues end up in the coffers of germany 's 16 states , none of which wants to lose income if motorists switch to less-polluting cars . state governments indicated they would wait to see what berlin proposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the car tax is unfair motorists ' clubs were critical .
the biggest , the adac , said it would only back the change if it did not lead to an increase in overall revenues .
spokesman martin remper said an emissions tax should not apply to older cars at all . another club , avd , assailed the tax as unfair , since it would apply regardless of how far or how fast a car was actually driven . " somebody who races to every intersection has got a different consumption from those who drop their speed in advance , " spokesman johannes huebner said .
" this tax would be unconstitutional . "
he said it would be fairer to tax fuel only , not cars . analysts said an outcry was likely if the tax turned out to be punitive on lower-income buyers of cheap cars while favoring rich people who can afford to buy sophisticated exhaust-reducing features . torsten albig , a finance ministry official , added that it would be almost impossible to fairly assess the exhaust quality of pre-2005 cars .
even quality labels for new cars could be contested . the european commission has already issued an emissions target for the continent 's truck and bus fleet .
by 2012 , heavy vehicles are supposed to reduce their average carbon-dioxide emissions to 130 grams per kilometer driven . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german auto industry calls eu 's co2 diet unworkable germans are regarded as environmentally friendly , but they have a penchant for gas guzzling cars , leading some to say that putting the onus to reduce emission solely on the car industry is unfair .

but they could lose their place at the top if they are n't careful , germany 's environment minister pointed out . germany 's renewable energy sector exported installations worth 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- in 2006 , as opposed to exports of only 500 million euros in 2000 , the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung -lrb- fas -rrb- newspaper wrote on sunday , quoting figures from the branch association bundesverband erneuerbare energien .
the branch intends to grow by 10 percent each year and to reach turnover of around 120 billion euros by 2010 .
currently turnover stands at around 16.4 billion euros .
the branch also aimed to increase the number of workers in the field - now around 170,000 - to 500,000 by 2010 , the paper wrote .
companies in " hamburg , husum , thalheim and freiburg are the stars in the production of solar cells , windmills and bio-fuel plants , " according to the fas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of freiburg also uses water power one-third of the water-power installations worldwide come from the german company voith from heidesheim , and nearly every other windmill and every third solar cell were made in germany , the paper wrote .
thirty-four percent of the cells were exported .
us could be a threat the paper credited germany 's previous government of social democrats and greens with fostering renewable energies , but said the breakthrough in the field was a result of the worldwide debate about climate change and concerns about russia supplying energy to europe . german environment minister sigmar gabriel , however , said that us companies could take the place of german and european companies in important export markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel , a social democrat , says germany has to work hard to stay on top " europe must make a great effort not to be left behind , " he told the financial times deutschland in an interview published monday . " the usa is making enormous leeway in the use of renewable energies , though not so much for ecological reasons , but rather strategic reasons , " he said .
" they discovered these energies to make themselves more independent of gas and oil imports . " gabriel announced that , consequently , he work toward doubling the amount of non-fossil new energies in germany by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un : europe needs to increase efforts to fight climate change european countries need to lead by example to counteract the effects of global warming instead of complaining about nations that are n't pulling their weight , the head of the un 's environment program said saturday .
-lrb- 17.02.2007 -rrb- german car lobby appears to bend will of eu regulators it appears germany 's mighty automobile lobby is getting its way in brussels , as the eu moves its regulatory focus from emissions standards to biofuel use across the bloc .

" the aim is not to make more money , but to do something for the environment , " he said . tiefensee pointed out that the levy would instead replace an existing tax that rises in step with the cubic capacity of a car 's engine . " overall car owners will not pay more taxes that they have until now , " said sigmar gabriel , the country 's environment minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee says german carmakers have to do more to cut emissions tiefensee said over the weekend that germany and other european carmakers had to do more to protect the environment after the head of the un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , achim steiner said in a newspaper interview that european nations were not doing enough to fight climate change and had grown complacent . " the government will be pursuing that aim and that 's why we 're going to reform the motor vehicle taxes .
the size of the engine will no longer be the determining factor but rather the impact on the environment , not only co2 but other pollutants , " tiefensee told a news conference . " those who continue to drive stink-bombs will have to pay more .

though german chancellor angela merkel has vowed to make fighting climate change a priority during germany 's twin presidencies of the eu and g8 , the country 's recent track record on cutting greenhouses gases has slipped . germany had pledged to cut co2 emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 under the kyoto protocol , but is likely to fall short of its target by one-fifth .

germany 's 12,000-kilometer autobahn system is unique in the world , having no limits on most of its length .
but tiefensee has strongly opposed speed limits . advocates say plan could cut pollution tiefensee 's proposal to tax cars based on emissions was welcomed by some on monday . " if germany went ahead with such a tax , then i 'm sure many others would follow , " eu industry commissioner günther verheugen told a german radio station . the german car industry too seemed open to the proposal .

the reason ?
the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .
this is when germany 's " baby-boomer " generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate . " the shortfall in the work-place will put a brake on the economy , " plünnecke said . france gets it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose side is ursula von der leyen on ?
to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .
" but i want to emphasize that parents who stay home with their kids from birth until the age of three should not be regarded as belonging to the last century . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tackles demographic challenges at conference under growing pressure to tackle the challenges of a shrinking workforce and an ageing population , the eu has urged member states to help citizens better unite paid work with family commitments at a special forum .

germany 's 12,000-kilometer autobahn system is unique in the world , having no limits on most of its length .
but tiefensee has strongly opposed speed limits . advocates say plan could cut pollution tiefensee 's proposal to tax cars based on emissions was welcomed by some on monday . " if germany went ahead with such a tax , then i 'm sure many others would follow , " eu industry commissioner günther verheugen told a german radio station . the german car industry too seemed open to the proposal .
bernd gottschalk , president of the association of german carmakers , said it would give people an additional incentive to trade in their cars for new , more efficient vehicles . daimlerchrysler , maker of mercedes cars and trucks , welcomed the proposal in principle .
a spokeswoman said changing the tax scale from engine size to emissions made sense , but added , " the tax should not have an impact on competition . " currently the flat vehicle tax in germany for a used car of just under 2 liters ' engine capacity is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- per year . environment minister sigmar gabriel said nine of the european union 's 27 nations already tax cars according to emission quality and this had been partly successful in cutting carbon-dioxide output . critics say tax is not fair however battle lines could soon be drawn over the tax change .
the revenues end up in the coffers of germany 's 16 states , none of which wants to lose income if motorists switch to less-polluting cars . state governments indicated they would wait to see what berlin proposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the car tax is unfair motorists ' clubs were critical .
the biggest , the adac , said it would only back the change if it did not lead to an increase in overall revenues .
spokesman martin remper said an emissions tax should not apply to older cars at all . another club , avd , assailed the tax as unfair , since it would apply regardless of how far or how fast a car was actually driven . " somebody who races to every intersection has got a different consumption from those who drop their speed in advance , " spokesman johannes huebner said .
" this tax would be unconstitutional . "
he said it would be fairer to tax fuel only , not cars . analysts said an outcry was likely if the tax turned out to be punitive on lower-income buyers of cheap cars while favoring rich people who can afford to buy sophisticated exhaust-reducing features . torsten albig , a finance ministry official , added that it would be almost impossible to fairly assess the exhaust quality of pre-2005 cars .
even quality labels for new cars could be contested . the european commission has already issued an emissions target for the continent 's truck and bus fleet .
by 2012 , heavy vehicles are supposed to reduce their average carbon-dioxide emissions to 130 grams per kilometer driven . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german auto industry calls eu 's co2 diet unworkable germans are regarded as environmentally friendly , but they have a penchant for gas guzzling cars , leading some to say that putting the onus to reduce emission solely on the car industry is unfair .
-lrb- 13.02.2007 -rrb- eu backs down on climate limits to please auto industry what the european union called a satisfactory compromise on its new climate protection plan has been met with skepticism from both environmental protection groups and the auto industry .

the reason ?
the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .
this is when germany 's " baby-boomer " generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate . " the shortfall in the work-place will put a brake on the economy , " plünnecke said . france gets it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose side is ursula von der leyen on ?
to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .
" but i want to emphasize that parents who stay home with their kids from birth until the age of three should not be regarded as belonging to the last century .

" the depiction of islam was " barefaced lies " and the float was " using negative images to seek attention , " the central council 's secretary general aiman mazyek told tuesday 's edition of the westdeutsche zeitung daily . mazyek said he asked himself what the float was meant to signal .
" this is how i read the message : ' we love our prejudices and we strengthen them with blatant lies if necessary , " ' mazyek told the paper .
" it has nothing to do with humor , " he added . carnival back to satirical themes organizers of the festivities in the carnival centers of cologne , düsseldorf and mainz had promised a return to satirical themes this year after a relatively restrained showing in 2006 in the wake of the controversy over the publication by a danish newspaper of cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french presidential candidates sarkozy and royal depicted as boxing cockerels cologne played host to the main parade , with 99 floats edging through the city , cheered on by hundreds of thousands of revellers in costume and wearing wigs . one float in cologne showed us president george w. bush being spanked by the statue of liberty while another depicted french presidential candidates segolene royal and nicolas sarkozy as boxing cockerels . carnival is a tradition stemming from catholic regions in the west and south of germany , but it is rapidly being adopted by cities in the north and east . the processions take place on what is known as rose monday , although opinions differ on the origin of the term . some say it is derived from the word " rhosen " from the rhineland dialect , meaning dashing or romping .
others link it to rose sunday , so-called since the middle ages because the pope traditionally presented a golden rose to a worthy citizen on that day . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel to european parliament : " europe 's soul is tolerance " french satire mag in court over reprinted mohammad cartoons in a civil action , muslim groups have taken a french satire magazine to court for reprinting the controversial danish cartoons of the prophet mohammad .

but they could lose their place at the top if they are n't careful , germany 's environment minister pointed out . germany 's renewable energy sector exported installations worth 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- in 2006 , as opposed to exports of only 500 million euros in 2000 , the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung -lrb- fas -rrb- newspaper wrote on sunday , quoting figures from the branch association bundesverband erneuerbare energien .
the branch intends to grow by 10 percent each year and to reach turnover of around 120 billion euros by 2010 .
currently turnover stands at around 16.4 billion euros .
the branch also aimed to increase the number of workers in the field - now around 170,000 - to 500,000 by 2010 , the paper wrote .
companies in " hamburg , husum , thalheim and freiburg are the stars in the production of solar cells , windmills and bio-fuel plants , " according to the fas .

thirty-four percent of the cells were exported .
us could be a threat the paper credited germany 's previous government of social democrats and greens with fostering renewable energies , but said the breakthrough in the field was a result of the worldwide debate about climate change and concerns about russia supplying energy to europe . german environment minister sigmar gabriel , however , said that us companies could take the place of german and european companies in important export markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel , a social democrat , says germany has to work hard to stay on top " europe must make a great effort not to be left behind , " he told the financial times deutschland in an interview published monday . " the usa is making enormous leeway in the use of renewable energies , though not so much for ecological reasons , but rather strategic reasons , " he said .

the reason ?
the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .
this is when germany 's " baby-boomer " generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate . " the shortfall in the work-place will put a brake on the economy , " plünnecke said . france gets it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose side is ursula von der leyen on ?
to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .
" but i want to emphasize that parents who stay home with their kids from birth until the age of three should not be regarded as belonging to the last century .

" the atmosphere is becoming more and more tense , " a union source said friday as the release of the plan approached . eads , which owns airbus , is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close political ties .
the remaining 42 percent is publicly held . workers unnerved by possible cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker 's union wants employees to mobilize against the restructuring program the cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " that has unnerved workers in both france and germany , which hold major stakes in eads . airbus , employing about 56,000 people , has said the restructuring will entail job losses , carried out according to age considerations as well as through a reduction in part-time and short-term employment . the manufacturer hopes to save 30 percent in operating costs .
it is expected to tighten the management structure of subsidiaries in france , germany , spain and britain and to streamline certain administrative functions . a greater reliance is also foreseen on sub-contractors for activities that are not part of the core airbus operation .
sources have said the plan would reduce internal production from 65 percent to 50 percent . jobs at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois is facing pressure from french and german political leaders in addition , some of the 16 european sites could be closed or sold under changes in the distribution of production tasks in europe . the french business newspaper les echos reported on monday that airbus could cut up to 12,000 jobs , with 3,000-4,000 in both france and germany . la tribune daily said the plan could affect up to 10,000 jobs and that three factories would close : meaulte in france and varel and nordenham in germany . job losses are a particularly sensitive issue in france in the run up to presidential elections in april and may this year . the french cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " . german workers , who fear they will bear the brunt of the reorganization , are especially anxious about the fate of a plant in hamburg , which has been held partially responsible for production problems with the a380 . unconfirmed reports have said some of the work done on the a380 could be transferred to airbus plants in toulouse , southern france , which would also be responsible for assembling the new a350 long-haul carrier . in exchange the hamburg factory would take on assembling the single-aisle a320 . politicians applying pressure in december , airbus chief gallois said when launching the 10-billion-euro a350xwb project that it depended on application of power 8 .
airbus is counting on cost savings to help finance the development and manufacturing costs of the aircraft , which is destined to compete with the successful boeing 787 dreamliner . the plan is fraught with delicate political considerations , with german and french national interests bound up in its implementation . german economy minister michael glos has vowed to do everything possible to protect the future of german production sites and has hinted that germany might consider withdrawing some of its defense contracts with eads , the airbus parent . in a veiled threat illustrating the political pressure placed on eads and airbus , german economy minister michael glos warned at the beginning of the month that the country would " review " its contracts with eads if job cuts hit german workers more workers in other countries . gallois has meanwhile had to defend the project in meetings with french prime minister dominique de villepin and german chancellor angela merkel , who have demanded balanced treatment for all parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program airbus may be looking for companies to take over production sites threatened with closure under a major restructuring plan , said german state leader christian wulff , after talks with execs from airbus parent firm eads .

thirty-four percent of the cells were exported .
us could be a threat the paper credited germany 's previous government of social democrats and greens with fostering renewable energies , but said the breakthrough in the field was a result of the worldwide debate about climate change and concerns about russia supplying energy to europe . german environment minister sigmar gabriel , however , said that us companies could take the place of german and european companies in important export markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel , a social democrat , says germany has to work hard to stay on top " europe must make a great effort not to be left behind , " he told the financial times deutschland in an interview published monday .

" the depiction of islam was " barefaced lies " and the float was " using negative images to seek attention , " the central council 's secretary general aiman mazyek told tuesday 's edition of the westdeutsche zeitung daily . mazyek said he asked himself what the float was meant to signal .
" this is how i read the message : ' we love our prejudices and we strengthen them with blatant lies if necessary , " ' mazyek told the paper .
" it has nothing to do with humor , " he added . carnival back to satirical themes organizers of the festivities in the carnival centers of cologne , düsseldorf and mainz had promised a return to satirical themes this year after a relatively restrained showing in 2006 in the wake of the controversy over the publication by a danish newspaper of cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french presidential candidates sarkozy and royal depicted as boxing cockerels cologne played host to the main parade , with 99 floats edging through the city , cheered on by hundreds of thousands of revellers in costume and wearing wigs . one float in cologne showed us president george w. bush being spanked by the statue of liberty while another depicted french presidential candidates segolene royal and nicolas sarkozy as boxing cockerels . carnival is a tradition stemming from catholic regions in the west and south of germany , but it is rapidly being adopted by cities in the north and east . the processions take place on what is known as rose monday , although opinions differ on the origin of the term . some say it is derived from the word " rhosen " from the rhineland dialect , meaning dashing or romping .
others link it to rose sunday , so-called since the middle ages because the pope traditionally presented a golden rose to a worthy citizen on that day . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel to european parliament : " europe 's soul is tolerance " french satire mag in court over reprinted mohammad cartoons in a civil action , muslim groups have taken a french satire magazine to court for reprinting the controversial danish cartoons of the prophet mohammad .

to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .

many in europe , however , remain concerned about the country 's spotty human rights record . meeting eu demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aliev was in berlin last week looking for germany to invest in his country aliev said during a visit to germany last week that his oil-rich nation needed another five years to raise human-rights standards to match levels required under good-neighbor agreements with european states . germany , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , played an important role in tightening the 27-member bloc 's relations with azerbaijan . european union officials vowed last year to forge stronger links with suppliers of vital oil and gas in a bid to ease the bloc 's current dependence on energy-rich but increasingly assertive russia . the eu is backing westward gas pipelines from the caspian sea fields via ukraine and turkey .
a line , code-named nabucco , is to be commissioned by 2011 .
it would pick up gas from turkish pipelines and shift it to western europe 's grid via bulgaria and romania . during his trip , steinmeier is also scheduled to confer with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and armenian prime minister andranik margarjan . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to visit former soviet republics foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier began a series of visits to the southern caucasus states of azerbaijan , georgia and armenia on sunday to discuss energy issues with the oil-rich former soviet republics .

but they could lose their place at the top if they are n't careful , germany 's environment minister pointed out . germany 's renewable energy sector exported installations worth 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- in 2006 , as opposed to exports of only 500 million euros in 2000 , the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung -lrb- fas -rrb- newspaper wrote on sunday , quoting figures from the branch association bundesverband erneuerbare energien .
the branch intends to grow by 10 percent each year and to reach turnover of around 120 billion euros by 2010 .
currently turnover stands at around 16.4 billion euros .
the branch also aimed to increase the number of workers in the field - now around 170,000 - to 500,000 by 2010 , the paper wrote .
companies in " hamburg , husum , thalheim and freiburg are the stars in the production of solar cells , windmills and bio-fuel plants , " according to the fas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of freiburg also uses water power one-third of the water-power installations worldwide come from the german company voith from heidesheim , and nearly every other windmill and every third solar cell were made in germany , the paper wrote .
thirty-four percent of the cells were exported .
us could be a threat the paper credited germany 's previous government of social democrats and greens with fostering renewable energies , but said the breakthrough in the field was a result of the worldwide debate about climate change and concerns about russia supplying energy to europe . german environment minister sigmar gabriel , however , said that us companies could take the place of german and european companies in important export markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel , a social democrat , says germany has to work hard to stay on top " europe must make a great effort not to be left behind , " he told the financial times deutschland in an interview published monday . " the usa is making enormous leeway in the use of renewable energies , though not so much for ecological reasons , but rather strategic reasons , " he said .
" they discovered these energies to make themselves more independent of gas and oil imports . " gabriel announced that , consequently , he work toward doubling the amount of non-fossil new energies in germany by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un : europe needs to increase efforts to fight climate change european countries need to lead by example to counteract the effects of global warming instead of complaining about nations that are n't pulling their weight , the head of the un 's environment program said saturday .

" we are bearing proof of its ability to evolve , to adapt to new circumstances and to the demands of our citizens , " said villepin . the changes strike a balance between the need for transparency , the equality of all citizens before the law and the stability of the state , added the prime minister . the amendment was adopted by a vote of 449 to 203 , with 217 abstentions . under the changes , a two-thirds majority of votes from both houses is required to launch the impeachment proceedings against the president . chirac may face probe the vote followed two landmark court rulings reached early in chirac 's mandate , which established that a serving president can not be prosecuted , charged or forced to testify in a common law case . the two rulings , by the constitutional court in 1999 and france 's highest appeals court , the cour de cassation , in 2001 , sparked controversy by enabling chirac to avoid questioning in a corruption probe . but they also specified that the president 's time in office should not be taken into account under the statute of limitations , meaning chirac could be questioned once he stands down . in particular he could be investigated over illegal salaries paid to members of his party out of paris municipal coffers between 1988 and 1995 - over which his ally and former prime minister alain juppe was convicted in 2004 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and chirac urge african leaders to confront own crises german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac on thursday urged african leaders meeting in the riviera resort of cannes to work to resolve ongoing crises on their continent .

" the atmosphere is becoming more and more tense , " a union source said friday as the release of the plan approached . eads , which owns airbus , is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close political ties .
the remaining 42 percent is publicly held . workers unnerved by possible cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker 's union wants employees to mobilize against the restructuring program the cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " that has unnerved workers in both france and germany , which hold major stakes in eads . airbus , employing about 56,000 people , has said the restructuring will entail job losses , carried out according to age considerations as well as through a reduction in part-time and short-term employment . the manufacturer hopes to save 30 percent in operating costs .
it is expected to tighten the management structure of subsidiaries in france , germany , spain and britain and to streamline certain administrative functions . a greater reliance is also foreseen on sub-contractors for activities that are not part of the core airbus operation .
sources have said the plan would reduce internal production from 65 percent to 50 percent . jobs at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois is facing pressure from french and german political leaders in addition , some of the 16 european sites could be closed or sold under changes in the distribution of production tasks in europe . the french business newspaper les echos reported on monday that airbus could cut up to 12,000 jobs , with 3,000-4,000 in both france and germany . la tribune daily said the plan could affect up to 10,000 jobs and that three factories would close : meaulte in france and varel and nordenham in germany . job losses are a particularly sensitive issue in france in the run up to presidential elections in april and may this year . the french cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " . german workers , who fear they will bear the brunt of the reorganization , are especially anxious about the fate of a plant in hamburg , which has been held partially responsible for production problems with the a380 . unconfirmed reports have said some of the work done on the a380 could be transferred to airbus plants in toulouse , southern france , which would also be responsible for assembling the new a350 long-haul carrier . in exchange the hamburg factory would take on assembling the single-aisle a320 . politicians applying pressure in december , airbus chief gallois said when launching the 10-billion-euro a350xwb project that it depended on application of power 8 .
airbus is counting on cost savings to help finance the development and manufacturing costs of the aircraft , which is destined to compete with the successful boeing 787 dreamliner . the plan is fraught with delicate political considerations , with german and french national interests bound up in its implementation . german economy minister michael glos has vowed to do everything possible to protect the future of german production sites and has hinted that germany might consider withdrawing some of its defense contracts with eads , the airbus parent . in a veiled threat illustrating the political pressure placed on eads and airbus , german economy minister michael glos warned at the beginning of the month that the country would " review " its contracts with eads if job cuts hit german workers more workers in other countries . gallois has meanwhile had to defend the project in meetings with french prime minister dominique de villepin and german chancellor angela merkel , who have demanded balanced treatment for all parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program airbus may be looking for companies to take over production sites threatened with closure under a major restructuring plan , said german state leader christian wulff , after talks with execs from airbus parent firm eads .

" the depiction of islam was " barefaced lies " and the float was " using negative images to seek attention , " the central council 's secretary general aiman mazyek told tuesday 's edition of the westdeutsche zeitung daily . mazyek said he asked himself what the float was meant to signal .
" this is how i read the message : ' we love our prejudices and we strengthen them with blatant lies if necessary , " ' mazyek told the paper .
" it has nothing to do with humor , " he added . carnival back to satirical themes organizers of the festivities in the carnival centers of cologne , düsseldorf and mainz had promised a return to satirical themes this year after a relatively restrained showing in 2006 in the wake of the controversy over the publication by a danish newspaper of cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french presidential candidates sarkozy and royal depicted as boxing cockerels cologne played host to the main parade , with 99 floats edging through the city , cheered on by hundreds of thousands of revellers in costume and wearing wigs . one float in cologne showed us president george w. bush being spanked by the statue of liberty while another depicted french presidential candidates segolene royal and nicolas sarkozy as boxing cockerels . carnival is a tradition stemming from catholic regions in the west and south of germany , but it is rapidly being adopted by cities in the north and east . the processions take place on what is known as rose monday , although opinions differ on the origin of the term . some say it is derived from the word " rhosen " from the rhineland dialect , meaning dashing or romping .
others link it to rose sunday , so-called since the middle ages because the pope traditionally presented a golden rose to a worthy citizen on that day . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel to european parliament : " europe 's soul is tolerance " french satire mag in court over reprinted mohammad cartoons in a civil action , muslim groups have taken a french satire magazine to court for reprinting the controversial danish cartoons of the prophet mohammad .

many in europe , however , remain concerned about the country 's spotty human rights record . meeting eu demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aliev was in berlin last week looking for germany to invest in his country aliev said during a visit to germany last week that his oil-rich nation needed another five years to raise human-rights standards to match levels required under good-neighbor agreements with european states . germany , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , played an important role in tightening the 27-member bloc 's relations with azerbaijan . european union officials vowed last year to forge stronger links with suppliers of vital oil and gas in a bid to ease the bloc 's current dependence on energy-rich but increasingly assertive russia . the eu is backing westward gas pipelines from the caspian sea fields via ukraine and turkey .
a line , code-named nabucco , is to be commissioned by 2011 .
it would pick up gas from turkish pipelines and shift it to western europe 's grid via bulgaria and romania . during his trip , steinmeier is also scheduled to confer with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and armenian prime minister andranik margarjan . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to visit former soviet republics foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier began a series of visits to the southern caucasus states of azerbaijan , georgia and armenia on sunday to discuss energy issues with the oil-rich former soviet republics .

it is expected to tighten the management structure of subsidiaries in france , germany , spain and britain and to streamline certain administrative functions . a greater reliance is also foreseen on sub-contractors for activities that are not part of the core airbus operation .

airbus is counting on cost savings to help finance the development and manufacturing costs of the aircraft , which is destined to compete with the successful boeing 787 dreamliner . the plan is fraught with delicate political considerations , with german and french national interests bound up in its implementation . german economy minister michael glos has vowed to do everything possible to protect the future of german production sites and has hinted that germany might consider withdrawing some of its defense contracts with eads , the airbus parent . in a veiled threat illustrating the political pressure placed on eads and airbus , german economy minister michael glos warned at the beginning of the month that the country would " review " its contracts with eads if job cuts hit german workers more workers in other countries . gallois has meanwhile had to defend the project in meetings with french prime minister dominique de villepin and german chancellor angela merkel , who have demanded balanced treatment for all parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program airbus may be looking for companies to take over production sites threatened with closure under a major restructuring plan , said german state leader christian wulff , after talks with execs from airbus parent firm eads .

" the atmosphere is becoming more and more tense , " a union source said friday as the release of the plan approached . eads , which owns airbus , is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close political ties .

the reason ?
the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .
this is when germany 's " baby-boomer " generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate . " the shortfall in the work-place will put a brake on the economy , " plünnecke said . france gets it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose side is ursula von der leyen on ?
to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .
" but i want to emphasize that parents who stay home with their kids from birth until the age of three should not be regarded as belonging to the last century .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the clock is ticking eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions germany in top five countries fighting climate change germany boosts investment in climate change research interviews : the united nations and climate change environment -pipe- 19.02.2007 german plan to tax cars on emissions gets wary nod großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who drive polluting cars will be penalized under the proposed plan plans by the german government to tax cars based on emissions instead of engine size in a bid to encourage carmakers to design " greener " cars have met with a cautious welcome . german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee insisted monday that a planned flat tax on cars based on emissions would not impose a financial burden on car owners . " the aim is not to make more money , but to do something for the environment , " he said . tiefensee pointed out that the levy would instead replace an existing tax that rises in step with the cubic capacity of a car 's engine . " overall car owners will not pay more taxes that they have until now , " said sigmar gabriel , the country 's environment minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee says german carmakers have to do more to cut emissions tiefensee said over the weekend that germany and other european carmakers had to do more to protect the environment after the head of the un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , achim steiner said in a newspaper interview that european nations were not doing enough to fight climate change and had grown complacent . " the government will be pursuing that aim and that 's why we 're going to reform the motor vehicle taxes .
the size of the engine will no longer be the determining factor but rather the impact on the environment , not only co2 but other pollutants , " tiefensee told a news conference . " those who continue to drive stink-bombs will have to pay more .
we want a system that both rewards and punishes .
i 'm sure that 'll help boost technology for cars in germany and europe that pollute less and need less fuel . " tiefensee said legislation could possibly be drafted by berlin before the year is out . germany europe 's biggest polluter germany remains europe 's biggest polluter .
though german chancellor angela merkel has vowed to make fighting climate change a priority during germany 's twin presidencies of the eu and g8 , the country 's recent track record on cutting greenhouses gases has slipped . germany had pledged to cut co2 emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 under the kyoto protocol , but is likely to fall short of its target by one-fifth .
scientists warn that if emissions are n't curbed , it will lead to dramatic climatic changers , triggering frequent droughts and floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say imposing a speed limit on germany 's autobahns is the quickest way to cut pollution critics have said that a general speed limit on highways would be the quickest way to cut emissions .
germany 's 12,000-kilometer autobahn system is unique in the world , having no limits on most of its length .
but tiefensee has strongly opposed speed limits . advocates say plan could cut pollution tiefensee 's proposal to tax cars based on emissions was welcomed by some on monday . " if germany went ahead with such a tax , then i 'm sure many others would follow , " eu industry commissioner günther verheugen told a german radio station . the german car industry too seemed open to the proposal .
bernd gottschalk , president of the association of german carmakers , said it would give people an additional incentive to trade in their cars for new , more efficient vehicles . daimlerchrysler , maker of mercedes cars and trucks , welcomed the proposal in principle .
a spokeswoman said changing the tax scale from engine size to emissions made sense , but added , " the tax should not have an impact on competition . " currently the flat vehicle tax in germany for a used car of just under 2 liters ' engine capacity is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- per year . environment minister sigmar gabriel said nine of the european union 's 27 nations already tax cars according to emission quality and this had been partly successful in cutting carbon-dioxide output . critics say tax is not fair however battle lines could soon be drawn over the tax change .
the revenues end up in the coffers of germany 's 16 states , none of which wants to lose income if motorists switch to less-polluting cars . state governments indicated they would wait to see what berlin proposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the car tax is unfair motorists ' clubs were critical .
the biggest , the adac , said it would only back the change if it did not lead to an increase in overall revenues .
spokesman martin remper said an emissions tax should not apply to older cars at all . another club , avd , assailed the tax as unfair , since it would apply regardless of how far or how fast a car was actually driven . " somebody who races to every intersection has got a different consumption from those who drop their speed in advance , " spokesman johannes huebner said .
" this tax would be unconstitutional . "
he said it would be fairer to tax fuel only , not cars . analysts said an outcry was likely if the tax turned out to be punitive on lower-income buyers of cheap cars while favoring rich people who can afford to buy sophisticated exhaust-reducing features . torsten albig , a finance ministry official , added that it would be almost impossible to fairly assess the exhaust quality of pre-2005 cars .
even quality labels for new cars could be contested . the european commission has already issued an emissions target for the continent 's truck and bus fleet .
by 2012 , heavy vehicles are supposed to reduce their average carbon-dioxide emissions to 130 grams per kilometer driven . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german auto industry calls eu 's co2 diet unworkable germans are regarded as environmentally friendly , but they have a penchant for gas guzzling cars , leading some to say that putting the onus to reduce emission solely on the car industry is unfair .

one practitioner of molecular gastronomy is the düsseldorf-based chef richard nicolaus . his restaurant , km 747 , is located in a quiet area near the rhine river .
the kitchen is a far cry from the typical mad scientist 's laboratory with nary a test tube or microscope in sight .
the science begins when nicolaus starts cooking . " we 're going to make a satay skewer from tuna fish , and what 's different is that the tuna fish will be fried in a sugar water mixture at 120 degrees -lrb- celsius -rrb- , " nicolaus said . normally , the tuna would be cooked in oil , leaving it fatty .
by using a special type of sugar that heats like oil , nicolaus can cook the tuna and have it ready to serve in 10 seconds . " from the outside it 's almost crispy , " he said .
" i 'll drizzle a little with lemon over it and then season it with a fish-vegetable mixture . " the tuna fish creation is only one of many .

for 10 years he 'd cooked as a hobby .
but when he got the chance , he gladly exchanged a drawing table and compass for an oven and ladle and his background in mechanical engineering made it feel natural to experiment in the kitchen with the design and form of his culinary creations . the menu at km 747 does n't make it obvious that the chef is using a radically different method to prepare food .
the ingredients sound normal : smoked breast of duck , curry soup , grilled perch .
the surprise comes dish is served , said tanja schuch . " for me , the combination is important , " schuch said .
" a pea-mint purée , i have never eaten that way .
but when you taste it , it 's absolutely a culinary delight , and it 's obviously also visually interesting . " guests often ask nicolaus why , for example , the spinach on their plate forms a small tower instead of looking like its normal squishy self .
they want to know how he gets the duck breast so tender and how he made the seafood risotto .
nicolaus said he chats willingly about his cooking concept . but he does n't give diners much hope that they can recreate his food creations .

" the depiction of islam was " barefaced lies " and the float was " using negative images to seek attention , " the central council 's secretary general aiman mazyek told tuesday 's edition of the westdeutsche zeitung daily . mazyek said he asked himself what the float was meant to signal .
" this is how i read the message : ' we love our prejudices and we strengthen them with blatant lies if necessary , " ' mazyek told the paper .
" it has nothing to do with humor , " he added . carnival back to satirical themes organizers of the festivities in the carnival centers of cologne , düsseldorf and mainz had promised a return to satirical themes this year after a relatively restrained showing in 2006 in the wake of the controversy over the publication by a danish newspaper of cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french presidential candidates sarkozy and royal depicted as boxing cockerels cologne played host to the main parade , with 99 floats edging through the city , cheered on by hundreds of thousands of revellers in costume and wearing wigs . one float in cologne showed us president george w. bush being spanked by the statue of liberty while another depicted french presidential candidates segolene royal and nicolas sarkozy as boxing cockerels . carnival is a tradition stemming from catholic regions in the west and south of germany , but it is rapidly being adopted by cities in the north and east . the processions take place on what is known as rose monday , although opinions differ on the origin of the term . some say it is derived from the word " rhosen " from the rhineland dialect , meaning dashing or romping .

caviar gets served atop white chocolate or warm ice cream .
if a dish sounds like it defies the laws of nature , it 's likely a matter of molecular gastronomy , an approach to cooking that has entered the mainstream over the past few years . the most well known practitioner of this innovative way of cooking is spain 's three-star chef ferran adria .
at the beginning of the new millennium he grabbed headlines with creations such as apple caviar , parmesan spaghetti and blackberry-tobacco sorbet . a drizzle of science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : appearance is important german cuisine is also receiving a molecular twist as more chefs turn to physics and chemistry to create unusual dining experiences .
one practitioner of molecular gastronomy is the düsseldorf-based chef richard nicolaus . his restaurant , km 747 , is located in a quiet area near the rhine river .
the kitchen is a far cry from the typical mad scientist 's laboratory with nary a test tube or microscope in sight .
the science begins when nicolaus starts cooking . " we 're going to make a satay skewer from tuna fish , and what 's different is that the tuna fish will be fried in a sugar water mixture at 120 degrees -lrb- celsius -rrb- , " nicolaus said . normally , the tuna would be cooked in oil , leaving it fatty .
by using a special type of sugar that heats like oil , nicolaus can cook the tuna and have it ready to serve in 10 seconds . " from the outside it 's almost crispy , " he said .
" i 'll drizzle a little with lemon over it and then season it with a fish-vegetable mixture . " the tuna fish creation is only one of many .
guests can also try tomato jelly or cucumber foam .
for each dish on the menu , nicolaus uses a different trick from the molecular cooking world .
sauces are transformed into foam .
meat is cooked in a vacuum .
with the help of new substances he creates completely new consistencies . inventing new tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cooks are starting to think - and act - like chemists molecular cooking is pure physics , nicolaus said . " people nowadays want to experience new things , " he said .
" they want to discover new tastes and it happens that science brings the possibility for new products like , for example , jellies or chemicals . " the düsseldorf native came to molecular cooking via mechanical engineering .
for 10 years he 'd cooked as a hobby .
but when he got the chance , he gladly exchanged a drawing table and compass for an oven and ladle and his background in mechanical engineering made it feel natural to experiment in the kitchen with the design and form of his culinary creations . the menu at km 747 does n't make it obvious that the chef is using a radically different method to prepare food .
the ingredients sound normal : smoked breast of duck , curry soup , grilled perch .
the surprise comes dish is served , said tanja schuch . " for me , the combination is important , " schuch said .
" a pea-mint purée , i have never eaten that way .
but when you taste it , it 's absolutely a culinary delight , and it 's obviously also visually interesting . " guests often ask nicolaus why , for example , the spinach on their plate forms a small tower instead of looking like its normal squishy self .
they want to know how he gets the duck breast so tender and how he made the seafood risotto .
nicolaus said he chats willingly about his cooking concept . but he does n't give diners much hope that they can recreate his food creations .
nicolaus spends a lot of time experimenting and honing his specialized techniques that , like all excellent cooking , require more effort than simply mixing ingredients together . nadja baeva -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de have your cake and eat it too in germany , enjoying coffee and cake in the afternoon is n't just for grannies .

" the depiction of islam was " barefaced lies " and the float was " using negative images to seek attention , " the central council 's secretary general aiman mazyek told tuesday 's edition of the westdeutsche zeitung daily . mazyek said he asked himself what the float was meant to signal .
" this is how i read the message : ' we love our prejudices and we strengthen them with blatant lies if necessary , " ' mazyek told the paper .
" it has nothing to do with humor , " he added . carnival back to satirical themes organizers of the festivities in the carnival centers of cologne , düsseldorf and mainz had promised a return to satirical themes this year after a relatively restrained showing in 2006 in the wake of the controversy over the publication by a danish newspaper of cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french presidential candidates sarkozy and royal depicted as boxing cockerels cologne played host to the main parade , with 99 floats edging through the city , cheered on by hundreds of thousands of revellers in costume and wearing wigs . one float in cologne showed us president george w. bush being spanked by the statue of liberty while another depicted french presidential candidates segolene royal and nicolas sarkozy as boxing cockerels . carnival is a tradition stemming from catholic regions in the west and south of germany , but it is rapidly being adopted by cities in the north and east . the processions take place on what is known as rose monday , although opinions differ on the origin of the term . some say it is derived from the word " rhosen " from the rhineland dialect , meaning dashing or romping .

the reason ?
the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .
this is when germany 's " baby-boomer " generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate . " the shortfall in the work-place will put a brake on the economy , " plünnecke said . france gets it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose side is ursula von der leyen on ?
to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .
" but i want to emphasize that parents who stay home with their kids from birth until the age of three should not be regarded as belonging to the last century .

the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .
this is when germany 's " baby-boomer " generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate .

to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .

" we are bearing proof of its ability to evolve , to adapt to new circumstances and to the demands of our citizens , " said villepin . the changes strike a balance between the need for transparency , the equality of all citizens before the law and the stability of the state , added the prime minister . the amendment was adopted by a vote of 449 to 203 , with 217 abstentions . under the changes , a two-thirds majority of votes from both houses is required to launch the impeachment proceedings against the president . chirac may face probe the vote followed two landmark court rulings reached early in chirac 's mandate , which established that a serving president can not be prosecuted , charged or forced to testify in a common law case . the two rulings , by the constitutional court in 1999 and france 's highest appeals court , the cour de cassation , in 2001 , sparked controversy by enabling chirac to avoid questioning in a corruption probe . but they also specified that the president 's time in office should not be taken into account under the statute of limitations , meaning chirac could be questioned once he stands down . in particular he could be investigated over illegal salaries paid to members of his party out of paris municipal coffers between 1988 and 1995 - over which his ally and former prime minister alain juppe was convicted in 2004 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and chirac urge african leaders to confront own crises german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac on thursday urged african leaders meeting in the riviera resort of cannes to work to resolve ongoing crises on their continent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the clock is ticking eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions germany in top five countries fighting climate change germany boosts investment in climate change research interviews : the united nations and climate change environment -pipe- 19.02.2007 german plan to tax cars on emissions gets wary nod großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who drive polluting cars will be penalized under the proposed plan plans by the german government to tax cars based on emissions instead of engine size in a bid to encourage carmakers to design " greener " cars have met with a cautious welcome . german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee insisted monday that a planned flat tax on cars based on emissions would not impose a financial burden on car owners . " the aim is not to make more money , but to do something for the environment , " he said . tiefensee pointed out that the levy would instead replace an existing tax that rises in step with the cubic capacity of a car 's engine . " overall car owners will not pay more taxes that they have until now , " said sigmar gabriel , the country 's environment minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee says german carmakers have to do more to cut emissions tiefensee said over the weekend that germany and other european carmakers had to do more to protect the environment after the head of the un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , achim steiner said in a newspaper interview that european nations were not doing enough to fight climate change and had grown complacent . " the government will be pursuing that aim and that 's why we 're going to reform the motor vehicle taxes .
the size of the engine will no longer be the determining factor but rather the impact on the environment , not only co2 but other pollutants , " tiefensee told a news conference . " those who continue to drive stink-bombs will have to pay more .
we want a system that both rewards and punishes .
i 'm sure that 'll help boost technology for cars in germany and europe that pollute less and need less fuel . " tiefensee said legislation could possibly be drafted by berlin before the year is out . germany europe 's biggest polluter germany remains europe 's biggest polluter .
though german chancellor angela merkel has vowed to make fighting climate change a priority during germany 's twin presidencies of the eu and g8 , the country 's recent track record on cutting greenhouses gases has slipped . germany had pledged to cut co2 emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 under the kyoto protocol , but is likely to fall short of its target by one-fifth .
scientists warn that if emissions are n't curbed , it will lead to dramatic climatic changers , triggering frequent droughts and floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say imposing a speed limit on germany 's autobahns is the quickest way to cut pollution critics have said that a general speed limit on highways would be the quickest way to cut emissions .
germany 's 12,000-kilometer autobahn system is unique in the world , having no limits on most of its length .
but tiefensee has strongly opposed speed limits . advocates say plan could cut pollution tiefensee 's proposal to tax cars based on emissions was welcomed by some on monday . " if germany went ahead with such a tax , then i 'm sure many others would follow , " eu industry commissioner günther verheugen told a german radio station . the german car industry too seemed open to the proposal .
bernd gottschalk , president of the association of german carmakers , said it would give people an additional incentive to trade in their cars for new , more efficient vehicles . daimlerchrysler , maker of mercedes cars and trucks , welcomed the proposal in principle .
a spokeswoman said changing the tax scale from engine size to emissions made sense , but added , " the tax should not have an impact on competition . " currently the flat vehicle tax in germany for a used car of just under 2 liters ' engine capacity is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- per year . environment minister sigmar gabriel said nine of the european union 's 27 nations already tax cars according to emission quality and this had been partly successful in cutting carbon-dioxide output . critics say tax is not fair however battle lines could soon be drawn over the tax change .
the revenues end up in the coffers of germany 's 16 states , none of which wants to lose income if motorists switch to less-polluting cars . state governments indicated they would wait to see what berlin proposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the car tax is unfair motorists ' clubs were critical .
the biggest , the adac , said it would only back the change if it did not lead to an increase in overall revenues .
spokesman martin remper said an emissions tax should not apply to older cars at all . another club , avd , assailed the tax as unfair , since it would apply regardless of how far or how fast a car was actually driven . " somebody who races to every intersection has got a different consumption from those who drop their speed in advance , " spokesman johannes huebner said .
" this tax would be unconstitutional . "
he said it would be fairer to tax fuel only , not cars . analysts said an outcry was likely if the tax turned out to be punitive on lower-income buyers of cheap cars while favoring rich people who can afford to buy sophisticated exhaust-reducing features . torsten albig , a finance ministry official , added that it would be almost impossible to fairly assess the exhaust quality of pre-2005 cars .
even quality labels for new cars could be contested . the european commission has already issued an emissions target for the continent 's truck and bus fleet .
by 2012 , heavy vehicles are supposed to reduce their average carbon-dioxide emissions to 130 grams per kilometer driven . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german auto industry calls eu 's co2 diet unworkable germans are regarded as environmentally friendly , but they have a penchant for gas guzzling cars , leading some to say that putting the onus to reduce emission solely on the car industry is unfair .

" the atmosphere is becoming more and more tense , " a union source said friday as the release of the plan approached . eads , which owns airbus , is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close political ties .
the remaining 42 percent is publicly held . workers unnerved by possible cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker 's union wants employees to mobilize against the restructuring program the cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " that has unnerved workers in both france and germany , which hold major stakes in eads . airbus , employing about 56,000 people , has said the restructuring will entail job losses , carried out according to age considerations as well as through a reduction in part-time and short-term employment . the manufacturer hopes to save 30 percent in operating costs .
it is expected to tighten the management structure of subsidiaries in france , germany , spain and britain and to streamline certain administrative functions . a greater reliance is also foreseen on sub-contractors for activities that are not part of the core airbus operation .
sources have said the plan would reduce internal production from 65 percent to 50 percent . jobs at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois is facing pressure from french and german political leaders in addition , some of the 16 european sites could be closed or sold under changes in the distribution of production tasks in europe . the french business newspaper les echos reported on monday that airbus could cut up to 12,000 jobs , with 3,000-4,000 in both france and germany . la tribune daily said the plan could affect up to 10,000 jobs and that three factories would close : meaulte in france and varel and nordenham in germany . job losses are a particularly sensitive issue in france in the run up to presidential elections in april and may this year . the french cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " . german workers , who fear they will bear the brunt of the reorganization , are especially anxious about the fate of a plant in hamburg , which has been held partially responsible for production problems with the a380 . unconfirmed reports have said some of the work done on the a380 could be transferred to airbus plants in toulouse , southern france , which would also be responsible for assembling the new a350 long-haul carrier . in exchange the hamburg factory would take on assembling the single-aisle a320 . politicians applying pressure in december , airbus chief gallois said when launching the 10-billion-euro a350xwb project that it depended on application of power 8 .
airbus is counting on cost savings to help finance the development and manufacturing costs of the aircraft , which is destined to compete with the successful boeing 787 dreamliner . the plan is fraught with delicate political considerations , with german and french national interests bound up in its implementation . german economy minister michael glos has vowed to do everything possible to protect the future of german production sites and has hinted that germany might consider withdrawing some of its defense contracts with eads , the airbus parent . in a veiled threat illustrating the political pressure placed on eads and airbus , german economy minister michael glos warned at the beginning of the month that the country would " review " its contracts with eads if job cuts hit german workers more workers in other countries . gallois has meanwhile had to defend the project in meetings with french prime minister dominique de villepin and german chancellor angela merkel , who have demanded balanced treatment for all parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program airbus may be looking for companies to take over production sites threatened with closure under a major restructuring plan , said german state leader christian wulff , after talks with execs from airbus parent firm eads .

" the aim is not to make more money , but to do something for the environment , " he said . tiefensee pointed out that the levy would instead replace an existing tax that rises in step with the cubic capacity of a car 's engine . " overall car owners will not pay more taxes that they have until now , " said sigmar gabriel , the country 's environment minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee says german carmakers have to do more to cut emissions tiefensee said over the weekend that germany and other european carmakers had to do more to protect the environment after the head of the un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , achim steiner said in a newspaper interview that european nations were not doing enough to fight climate change and had grown complacent . " the government will be pursuing that aim and that 's why we 're going to reform the motor vehicle taxes .
the size of the engine will no longer be the determining factor but rather the impact on the environment , not only co2 but other pollutants , " tiefensee told a news conference . " those who continue to drive stink-bombs will have to pay more .
we want a system that both rewards and punishes .
i 'm sure that 'll help boost technology for cars in germany and europe that pollute less and need less fuel . " tiefensee said legislation could possibly be drafted by berlin before the year is out . germany europe 's biggest polluter germany remains europe 's biggest polluter .
though german chancellor angela merkel has vowed to make fighting climate change a priority during germany 's twin presidencies of the eu and g8 , the country 's recent track record on cutting greenhouses gases has slipped . germany had pledged to cut co2 emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 under the kyoto protocol , but is likely to fall short of its target by one-fifth .
scientists warn that if emissions are n't curbed , it will lead to dramatic climatic changers , triggering frequent droughts and floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say imposing a speed limit on germany 's autobahns is the quickest way to cut pollution critics have said that a general speed limit on highways would be the quickest way to cut emissions .
germany 's 12,000-kilometer autobahn system is unique in the world , having no limits on most of its length .
but tiefensee has strongly opposed speed limits . advocates say plan could cut pollution tiefensee 's proposal to tax cars based on emissions was welcomed by some on monday . " if germany went ahead with such a tax , then i 'm sure many others would follow , " eu industry commissioner günther verheugen told a german radio station . the german car industry too seemed open to the proposal .
bernd gottschalk , president of the association of german carmakers , said it would give people an additional incentive to trade in their cars for new , more efficient vehicles . daimlerchrysler , maker of mercedes cars and trucks , welcomed the proposal in principle .
a spokeswoman said changing the tax scale from engine size to emissions made sense , but added , " the tax should not have an impact on competition . " currently the flat vehicle tax in germany for a used car of just under 2 liters ' engine capacity is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- per year . environment minister sigmar gabriel said nine of the european union 's 27 nations already tax cars according to emission quality and this had been partly successful in cutting carbon-dioxide output . critics say tax is not fair however battle lines could soon be drawn over the tax change .
the revenues end up in the coffers of germany 's 16 states , none of which wants to lose income if motorists switch to less-polluting cars . state governments indicated they would wait to see what berlin proposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the car tax is unfair motorists ' clubs were critical .
the biggest , the adac , said it would only back the change if it did not lead to an increase in overall revenues .
spokesman martin remper said an emissions tax should not apply to older cars at all . another club , avd , assailed the tax as unfair , since it would apply regardless of how far or how fast a car was actually driven . " somebody who races to every intersection has got a different consumption from those who drop their speed in advance , " spokesman johannes huebner said .
" this tax would be unconstitutional . "
he said it would be fairer to tax fuel only , not cars . analysts said an outcry was likely if the tax turned out to be punitive on lower-income buyers of cheap cars while favoring rich people who can afford to buy sophisticated exhaust-reducing features . torsten albig , a finance ministry official , added that it would be almost impossible to fairly assess the exhaust quality of pre-2005 cars .
even quality labels for new cars could be contested . the european commission has already issued an emissions target for the continent 's truck and bus fleet .
by 2012 , heavy vehicles are supposed to reduce their average carbon-dioxide emissions to 130 grams per kilometer driven . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german auto industry calls eu 's co2 diet unworkable germans are regarded as environmentally friendly , but they have a penchant for gas guzzling cars , leading some to say that putting the onus to reduce emission solely on the car industry is unfair .

the reason ?
the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .
this is when germany 's " baby-boomer " generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate . " the shortfall in the work-place will put a brake on the economy , " plünnecke said . france gets it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose side is ursula von der leyen on ?
to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .
" but i want to emphasize that parents who stay home with their kids from birth until the age of three should not be regarded as belonging to the last century .

the reason ?
the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .
this is when germany 's " baby-boomer " generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate . " the shortfall in the work-place will put a brake on the economy , " plünnecke said . france gets it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose side is ursula von der leyen on ?
to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .

the reason ?
the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .
this is when germany 's " baby-boomer " generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate . " the shortfall in the work-place will put a brake on the economy , " plünnecke said . france gets it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whose side is ursula von der leyen on ?
to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .
" but i want to emphasize that parents who stay home with their kids from birth until the age of three should not be regarded as belonging to the last century .

" the atmosphere is becoming more and more tense , " a union source said friday as the release of the plan approached . eads , which owns airbus , is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close political ties .
the remaining 42 percent is publicly held . workers unnerved by possible cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker 's union wants employees to mobilize against the restructuring program the cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " that has unnerved workers in both france and germany , which hold major stakes in eads . airbus , employing about 56,000 people , has said the restructuring will entail job losses , carried out according to age considerations as well as through a reduction in part-time and short-term employment . the manufacturer hopes to save 30 percent in operating costs .
it is expected to tighten the management structure of subsidiaries in france , germany , spain and britain and to streamline certain administrative functions . a greater reliance is also foreseen on sub-contractors for activities that are not part of the core airbus operation .
sources have said the plan would reduce internal production from 65 percent to 50 percent . jobs at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois is facing pressure from french and german political leaders in addition , some of the 16 european sites could be closed or sold under changes in the distribution of production tasks in europe . the french business newspaper les echos reported on monday that airbus could cut up to 12,000 jobs , with 3,000-4,000 in both france and germany . la tribune daily said the plan could affect up to 10,000 jobs and that three factories would close : meaulte in france and varel and nordenham in germany . job losses are a particularly sensitive issue in france in the run up to presidential elections in april and may this year . the french cgt union at airbus parent company eads had called for workers to mobilize on tuesday to denounce what it called a " gigantic transnational reorganization " . german workers , who fear they will bear the brunt of the reorganization , are especially anxious about the fate of a plant in hamburg , which has been held partially responsible for production problems with the a380 . unconfirmed reports have said some of the work done on the a380 could be transferred to airbus plants in toulouse , southern france , which would also be responsible for assembling the new a350 long-haul carrier . in exchange the hamburg factory would take on assembling the single-aisle a320 . politicians applying pressure in december , airbus chief gallois said when launching the 10-billion-euro a350xwb project that it depended on application of power 8 .
airbus is counting on cost savings to help finance the development and manufacturing costs of the aircraft , which is destined to compete with the successful boeing 787 dreamliner . the plan is fraught with delicate political considerations , with german and french national interests bound up in its implementation . german economy minister michael glos has vowed to do everything possible to protect the future of german production sites and has hinted that germany might consider withdrawing some of its defense contracts with eads , the airbus parent . in a veiled threat illustrating the political pressure placed on eads and airbus , german economy minister michael glos warned at the beginning of the month that the country would " review " its contracts with eads if job cuts hit german workers more workers in other countries . gallois has meanwhile had to defend the project in meetings with french prime minister dominique de villepin and german chancellor angela merkel , who have demanded balanced treatment for all parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program airbus may be looking for companies to take over production sites threatened with closure under a major restructuring plan , said german state leader christian wulff , after talks with execs from airbus parent firm eads .

" the atmosphere is becoming more and more tense , " a union source said friday as the release of the plan approached . eads , which owns airbus , is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close political ties .

" the aim is not to make more money , but to do something for the environment , " he said . tiefensee pointed out that the levy would instead replace an existing tax that rises in step with the cubic capacity of a car 's engine . " overall car owners will not pay more taxes that they have until now , " said sigmar gabriel , the country 's environment minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee says german carmakers have to do more to cut emissions tiefensee said over the weekend that germany and other european carmakers had to do more to protect the environment after the head of the un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , achim steiner said in a newspaper interview that european nations were not doing enough to fight climate change and had grown complacent . " the government will be pursuing that aim and that 's why we 're going to reform the motor vehicle taxes .
the size of the engine will no longer be the determining factor but rather the impact on the environment , not only co2 but other pollutants , " tiefensee told a news conference . " those who continue to drive stink-bombs will have to pay more .
we want a system that both rewards and punishes .
i 'm sure that 'll help boost technology for cars in germany and europe that pollute less and need less fuel . " tiefensee said legislation could possibly be drafted by berlin before the year is out . germany europe 's biggest polluter germany remains europe 's biggest polluter .
though german chancellor angela merkel has vowed to make fighting climate change a priority during germany 's twin presidencies of the eu and g8 , the country 's recent track record on cutting greenhouses gases has slipped . germany had pledged to cut co2 emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 under the kyoto protocol , but is likely to fall short of its target by one-fifth .
scientists warn that if emissions are n't curbed , it will lead to dramatic climatic changers , triggering frequent droughts and floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say imposing a speed limit on germany 's autobahns is the quickest way to cut pollution critics have said that a general speed limit on highways would be the quickest way to cut emissions .
germany 's 12,000-kilometer autobahn system is unique in the world , having no limits on most of its length .
but tiefensee has strongly opposed speed limits . advocates say plan could cut pollution tiefensee 's proposal to tax cars based on emissions was welcomed by some on monday . " if germany went ahead with such a tax , then i 'm sure many others would follow , " eu industry commissioner günther verheugen told a german radio station . the german car industry too seemed open to the proposal .
bernd gottschalk , president of the association of german carmakers , said it would give people an additional incentive to trade in their cars for new , more efficient vehicles . daimlerchrysler , maker of mercedes cars and trucks , welcomed the proposal in principle .
a spokeswoman said changing the tax scale from engine size to emissions made sense , but added , " the tax should not have an impact on competition . " currently the flat vehicle tax in germany for a used car of just under 2 liters ' engine capacity is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- per year . environment minister sigmar gabriel said nine of the european union 's 27 nations already tax cars according to emission quality and this had been partly successful in cutting carbon-dioxide output . critics say tax is not fair however battle lines could soon be drawn over the tax change .
the revenues end up in the coffers of germany 's 16 states , none of which wants to lose income if motorists switch to less-polluting cars . state governments indicated they would wait to see what berlin proposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the car tax is unfair motorists ' clubs were critical .
the biggest , the adac , said it would only back the change if it did not lead to an increase in overall revenues .
spokesman martin remper said an emissions tax should not apply to older cars at all . another club , avd , assailed the tax as unfair , since it would apply regardless of how far or how fast a car was actually driven . " somebody who races to every intersection has got a different consumption from those who drop their speed in advance , " spokesman johannes huebner said .
" this tax would be unconstitutional . "
he said it would be fairer to tax fuel only , not cars . analysts said an outcry was likely if the tax turned out to be punitive on lower-income buyers of cheap cars while favoring rich people who can afford to buy sophisticated exhaust-reducing features . torsten albig , a finance ministry official , added that it would be almost impossible to fairly assess the exhaust quality of pre-2005 cars .
even quality labels for new cars could be contested . the european commission has already issued an emissions target for the continent 's truck and bus fleet .
by 2012 , heavy vehicles are supposed to reduce their average carbon-dioxide emissions to 130 grams per kilometer driven . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german auto industry calls eu 's co2 diet unworkable germans are regarded as environmentally friendly , but they have a penchant for gas guzzling cars , leading some to say that putting the onus to reduce emission solely on the car industry is unfair .

if a dish sounds like it defies the laws of nature , it 's likely a matter of molecular gastronomy , an approach to cooking that has entered the mainstream over the past few years . the most well known practitioner of this innovative way of cooking is spain 's three-star chef ferran adria .

one practitioner of molecular gastronomy is the düsseldorf-based chef richard nicolaus . his restaurant , km 747 , is located in a quiet area near the rhine river .
the kitchen is a far cry from the typical mad scientist 's laboratory with nary a test tube or microscope in sight .
the science begins when nicolaus starts cooking . " we 're going to make a satay skewer from tuna fish , and what 's different is that the tuna fish will be fried in a sugar water mixture at 120 degrees -lrb- celsius -rrb- , " nicolaus said . normally , the tuna would be cooked in oil , leaving it fatty .
by using a special type of sugar that heats like oil , nicolaus can cook the tuna and have it ready to serve in 10 seconds . " from the outside it 's almost crispy , " he said .
" i 'll drizzle a little with lemon over it and then season it with a fish-vegetable mixture . " the tuna fish creation is only one of many .
guests can also try tomato jelly or cucumber foam .

" people nowadays want to experience new things , " he said .
" they want to discover new tastes and it happens that science brings the possibility for new products like , for example , jellies or chemicals . " the düsseldorf native came to molecular cooking via mechanical engineering .
for 10 years he 'd cooked as a hobby .
but when he got the chance , he gladly exchanged a drawing table and compass for an oven and ladle and his background in mechanical engineering made it feel natural to experiment in the kitchen with the design and form of his culinary creations . the menu at km 747 does n't make it obvious that the chef is using a radically different method to prepare food .
the ingredients sound normal : smoked breast of duck , curry soup , grilled perch .
the surprise comes dish is served , said tanja schuch . " for me , the combination is important , " schuch said .
" a pea-mint purée , i have never eaten that way .
but when you taste it , it 's absolutely a culinary delight , and it 's obviously also visually interesting . " guests often ask nicolaus why , for example , the spinach on their plate forms a small tower instead of looking like its normal squishy self .
they want to know how he gets the duck breast so tender and how he made the seafood risotto .
nicolaus said he chats willingly about his cooking concept . but he does n't give diners much hope that they can recreate his food creations .

if a dish sounds like it defies the laws of nature , it 's likely a matter of molecular gastronomy , an approach to cooking that has entered the mainstream over the past few years . the most well known practitioner of this innovative way of cooking is spain 's three-star chef ferran adria .
at the beginning of the new millennium he grabbed headlines with creations such as apple caviar , parmesan spaghetti and blackberry-tobacco sorbet . a drizzle of science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : appearance is important german cuisine is also receiving a molecular twist as more chefs turn to physics and chemistry to create unusual dining experiences .
one practitioner of molecular gastronomy is the düsseldorf-based chef richard nicolaus . his restaurant , km 747 , is located in a quiet area near the rhine river .
the kitchen is a far cry from the typical mad scientist 's laboratory with nary a test tube or microscope in sight .
the science begins when nicolaus starts cooking . " we 're going to make a satay skewer from tuna fish , and what 's different is that the tuna fish will be fried in a sugar water mixture at 120 degrees -lrb- celsius -rrb- , " nicolaus said . normally , the tuna would be cooked in oil , leaving it fatty .
by using a special type of sugar that heats like oil , nicolaus can cook the tuna and have it ready to serve in 10 seconds . " from the outside it 's almost crispy , " he said .
" i 'll drizzle a little with lemon over it and then season it with a fish-vegetable mixture . " the tuna fish creation is only one of many .
guests can also try tomato jelly or cucumber foam .
for each dish on the menu , nicolaus uses a different trick from the molecular cooking world .

" people nowadays want to experience new things , " he said .
" they want to discover new tastes and it happens that science brings the possibility for new products like , for example , jellies or chemicals . " the düsseldorf native came to molecular cooking via mechanical engineering .
for 10 years he 'd cooked as a hobby .
but when he got the chance , he gladly exchanged a drawing table and compass for an oven and ladle and his background in mechanical engineering made it feel natural to experiment in the kitchen with the design and form of his culinary creations . the menu at km 747 does n't make it obvious that the chef is using a radically different method to prepare food .
the ingredients sound normal : smoked breast of duck , curry soup , grilled perch .
the surprise comes dish is served , said tanja schuch . " for me , the combination is important , " schuch said .
" a pea-mint purée , i have never eaten that way .
but when you taste it , it 's absolutely a culinary delight , and it 's obviously also visually interesting . " guests often ask nicolaus why , for example , the spinach on their plate forms a small tower instead of looking like its normal squishy self .

the reason ?
the country 's declining birth-rate . family policy is topping the political agenda in berlin once again , after german family minister ursula von der leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities . her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der leyen of undermining family values . others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world , and a new study carried out by the institute for german economics -lrb- iw -rrb- provides more evidence that germany 's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy . slow-down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french economy will triumph while germany 's population decline is currently irreversible , france is seeing a population boost - and if demographic predictions prove correct , this will put france well on track to become the continent 's strongest economy by 2035 . according to the experts , the discrepancy between german and french economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035 . " the french economy will grow twice as fast as the german one in these years , " iw expert axel plünnecke told the weekly die welt .

to many , the development is an obvious return on the french government 's family-friendly policies . since 2000 , france has seen more births than germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants .
last year , france registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in germany , making it one of the most fertile countries in europe . this robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs , including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce ; full-time pre-school starting at age three ; subsidized day-care for the under-threes ; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children per family . germany , meanwhile , is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home , with critics maintaining that von der leyen 's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern . " if you want to give women the chance to work and have children too , you have to provide day care , " said cdu parliamentary chief , volker kauder .

" we are very concerned as churches that there should not be a repeat of the london docklands experience , " said the bishop of rochester , michael nazir-ali .
" there , the local communities found themselves alienated . "
a government spokesman said it was determined not to repeat the mistakes made in the docklands redevelopment .
the thames gateway stretches 40 miles from east london to southend in essex and sheerness in kent . "
if the young people here already have no stake in this prosperity that is a recipe for trouble " the rt rev michael nazir-ali the project aims to create 120,000 new homes and 180,000 jobs along the thames estuary by 2016 .
preparation for one of the gateway 's biggest developments , rochester riverside , has already begun in the shadow of rochester cathedral .
it will see 2,000 homes , office space , parks and shops built on a former industrial wasteland and is part of plans to turn the region of strood , rochester , chatham and gillingham into a coherent city .
but bishop nazir-ali believes that because the thames gateway development is led by private investment it lacks a central vision .
" the planners and developers have to give a lot more attention and a lot more of their resources to making sure these communities have a heart , " he said .
" they need to make sure they are not just places where people come to sleep . "
he believes the churches have a vital role in preventing the new developments becoming dormitory towns but says they have limited resources .
and he fears the impact on existing communities .
" there is prosperity on the doorstep - bluewater is an icon of a consumerist society , " he said .
" if the young people who live here already find they have no stake in this prosperity that is a recipe for trouble . "
a spokesman for communities and local government said the main aim of the thames gateway was to improve the lives of the 1.45 million people already living there , particularly the young .
" that is why working with and engaging local communities and local authorities , alongside investing in facilities such as new schools , colleges and university campuses is at the very heart of our programme , " he said .
" the docklands redevelopment was successful in many ways and has created thousands of new jobs .
" but this did not always benefit the existing communities and we have made clear many times we are determined not to repeat those mistakes of the past . "

action groups have been formed to fight the plans by powys local health board , which is facing a £ 3.5m deficit .
the board has said its buildings are outdated and patients deserve better .
but people campaigning for llanidloes , knighton , bronllys and builth wells hospitals have held a number of demonstrations .
the six gps , who all work at the hospitals under threat , will meet dr gibbons at the welsh assembly on monday .
latest demonstration cathy ysart , secretary of campaign group builth against closing hospitals , said : " the minister is actually a gp and it is hoped this will give him extra insight into the concerns local healthcare professionals have regarding powys lhb 's current plans to close in patient beds .
mrs ysart said the assembly government 's 10-year health care plan , designed for life , would also be discussed during the meeting .
last week , campaigners staged their latest demonstration against the plans .
protesters released 100 heart-shaped balloons and presented a 7,000-name petition at the board 's headquarters at bronllys , near brecon .
campaigners also presented valentine cards to medical staff working at the community hospital nearby in appreciation of their work .

ready to answer readers e-mails about how best to deal with staff disputes , here she outlines acas ' work , and why good work relations are key for any company .
the world of work has certainly changed over the last 30 years .
good staff relations are vital for any firm , says acas the workplace is no longer somewhere that simply employs people , produces goods or services and adapts to change as best it can .
instead the workplace is a now a dynamic environment .
it needs to promote equality , value diversity , develop team-working , encourage initiative and build relationships between employers and employees based on co-operation and , above all , trust .
ask rita donaghy a question why ?
because all of these things will help to make an organisation more productive than its competitors .
whether you are a large or small firm , good employment relations are key to business success .
if you have the right policies and procedures in place , then you are well on your way to dealing with any people issues that arise .
if not dealt with properly , issues such as absenteeism , bullying and discipline can be costly .
genuinely listen with more than 30 years experience in employment relations , acas understands that employers often find it difficult to get to grips with changes in legislation and what they mean in practice .
staff need to know what is expected of them in terms of standards of performance and behaviour our good practice advice and guidance makes it easier to keep up-to-date with the issues .
we recently helped thousands of individuals and employers understand what the new age discrimination rules meant to them .
acas also provides training to equip people with the skills to deal confidently with employment relations issues as well as one-to-one projects to help businesses .
with any new workplace policies or procedures , good communication is key .
employers should keep their employees informed and genuinely listen to their views .
by acknowledging the value of people 's work you are more likely to have a motivated workforce that can be vital for building confidence and encouraging initiative .
developing relationships is also about treating employees fairly - by developing equality and diversity policies - promoting flexible working , wherever possible , and encouraging staff to develop new skills .
prevention first nevertheless most organisations , however well-managed , will sooner or later encounter problems in their workplace .
when this happens , they will be easier to deal with if employees and managers know about and are clear on what the procedures mean in practice .
for example , people need to know what is expected of them in terms of standards of performance and behaviour .
employees do n't like to see colleagues ignoring rules or to see rules applied inconsistently or on the whim of a manager .
if there is a breakdown in a working relationship , mediation is a way to help people who do n't see eye to eye sort out any differences quickly .
in appropriate cases , it is an informal , economic and relatively stress-free means of solving the problem and getting back to work .
prevention is always better than cure , which is why acas ' advice , training and information helps organisations and businesses of all sizes develop good employment relations and find success .

ready to answer readers e-mails about how best to deal with staff disputes , here she outlines acas ' work , and why good work relations are key for any company .
the world of work has certainly changed over the last 30 years .
good staff relations are vital for any firm , says acas the workplace is no longer somewhere that simply employs people , produces goods or services and adapts to change as best it can .
instead the workplace is a now a dynamic environment .
it needs to promote equality , value diversity , develop team-working , encourage initiative and build relationships between employers and employees based on co-operation and , above all , trust .
ask rita donaghy a question why ?
because all of these things will help to make an organisation more productive than its competitors .
whether you are a large or small firm , good employment relations are key to business success .
if you have the right policies and procedures in place , then you are well on your way to dealing with any people issues that arise .
if not dealt with properly , issues such as absenteeism , bullying and discipline can be costly .
genuinely listen with more than 30 years experience in employment relations , acas understands that employers often find it difficult to get to grips with changes in legislation and what they mean in practice .
staff need to know what is expected of them in terms of standards of performance and behaviour our good practice advice and guidance makes it easier to keep up-to-date with the issues .
we recently helped thousands of individuals and employers understand what the new age discrimination rules meant to them .
acas also provides training to equip people with the skills to deal confidently with employment relations issues as well as one-to-one projects to help businesses .
with any new workplace policies or procedures , good communication is key .
employers should keep their employees informed and genuinely listen to their views .
by acknowledging the value of people 's work you are more likely to have a motivated workforce that can be vital for building confidence and encouraging initiative .
developing relationships is also about treating employees fairly - by developing equality and diversity policies - promoting flexible working , wherever possible , and encouraging staff to develop new skills .
prevention first nevertheless most organisations , however well-managed , will sooner or later encounter problems in their workplace .
when this happens , they will be easier to deal with if employees and managers know about and are clear on what the procedures mean in practice .
for example , people need to know what is expected of them in terms of standards of performance and behaviour .
employees do n't like to see colleagues ignoring rules or to see rules applied inconsistently or on the whim of a manager .
if there is a breakdown in a working relationship , mediation is a way to help people who do n't see eye to eye sort out any differences quickly .
in appropriate cases , it is an informal , economic and relatively stress-free means of solving the problem and getting back to work .
prevention is always better than cure , which is why acas ' advice , training and information helps organisations and businesses of all sizes develop good employment relations and find success .

the plea comes after the extension of the london congestion charge , which it is credited with cutting city traffic .
friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- scotland said air pollution was harming the health of the public .
last year , a scottish executive study concluded that road tolls were unlikely to be introduced in the near future .
foe scotland claimed congestion charges and better public transport could be the solution .

" this means greater investment in public transport , safer streets for cycling and walking , better land-use planning , and the introduction of a fair system of road-user or congestion charging . "
the executive report said a previous ' no ' vote on congestion charging in edinburgh and the time and money required to develop a national congestion charging scheme suggested that such schemes were only a distant possibility .
ministers have pledged to stabilise the volume of traffic on scotland 's roads by 2021 .
scheme extended in 2003 transport accounted for almost a fifth of all scottish greenhouse gas emissions .
the amount of traffic in scotland has grown by almost 20 % since in 1994 .
this weekend marked the fourth anniversary of the london congestion charge .
on monday morning , the scheme was extended to the west of the city , covering most of westminster and kensington and chelsea .
air quality mayor ken livingstone said the amount of traffic entering central london during charging hours had been cut by about 20 % .
it has also increased bus and bicycle use as well as cutting carbon dioxide emissions .
however , a spokesman for the national alliance against tolls scotland -lrb- naats -rrb- claimed the london scheme had not reduced congestion or improved air quality .

it has affected the fate of companies as much as countries .
and nowhere has been the change more dramatic than in the us car industry . "
the big three are facing their greatest challenge ever in their entire postwar history " professor garel rhys , cardiff university fifty years ago , american car companies dominated the world , especially the mighty gm , the world 's biggest industrial company , many of whose factories were based in flint , michigan , 40 miles north of detroit .
gm in decline for the grandparents of claire mcclinton , who made the journey from the poverty of the rural south to michigan just after world war ii , it was like arriving in another world .
" none of their children ever went hungry , we all had a good education , we had good jobs , and owned our own home .
we thought we were living the american dream , " she told the bbc .
globalisation series how detroit lost its dominance in the global car industry wednesday : lean production next week : china 's challenge claire 's whole family followed in their footsteps and became " flintsones , " working for gm - and so did claire .
they were loyal members of the autoworkers union , the uaw , which won increasing benefits for its members , with average wages of more than $ 50,000 plus overtime .
" we respected the union then , " she said .
" we believed it was the union that had delivered us the american dream . "
in the 1950s the detroit area had the highest median income , and highest rate of home ownership , of any major us city .
but times are very different now .
gm , under pressure from its competitors , is no longer making money in the american car market - and it has been closing plants all across flint .
gm worker 's view " we thought we were living the american dream " claire mcclinton , third generation gm autoworker , flint , michigan now there are only 6,000 gm workers in flint , compared to 100,000 at the peak , and the town and workers are suffering .
" flint has the highest rate of unemployment , poverty and homelessness in michigan , " claire told me .
she works in a shelter feeding the poor , and would like her union to get more involved in the community .
and she is not sure how much longer she will have a job - and if she retires , whether she will have any benefits .
gm has already told the unions it wants to cut the generous retirement and health care benefits it promised its workers in the halcyon days of success .
the company does plan to build more car plants in the future - but in emerging markets like china and india , not in the united states .
toyota rising but 400 miles south of flint , another group of car workers are feeling very different .
they work in toyota 's huge camry factory in georgetown , kentucky , and receive , by their standards , generous pay and benefits .
toyota is the fastest-growing car company in the united states , and it is building a new factory every year to keep up with demand .
and it is set to overtake gm this year as the world 's largest car company by sales .
for laura wilshire , from ashland , kentucky , life is good .
" this is the top notch job in the area , " she told the bbc .
toyota worker 's view " this is the top notch job in the area " laura wilshire , toyota worker , georgetown , kentucky she doubled her salary when she joined toyota , and the company provides a good health care plan for her family , including dental coverage for her two children .
and she says that toyota has also helped to provide better schools for her children by putting money into the town 's budget .
she says more is expected of workers at toyota than her previous job in a convenience store , but she does n't mind taking responsibility .
" if a seatbelt is n't right , i stop the line until it is fixed - that is an important issue as it could affect people 's safety . "
toyota encourages workers to take personal responsibility for defects , and to work together to fix them .
that attitude has given them a well-deserved reputation for quality and reliability - and the camry has been the best-selling car in america for the last ten years .
toyota has no trouble hiring the right sort of workers - 100,000 people applied for the 3,000 jobs when the plant opened in 1990 .
laura says she feels sad when she reads in the papers about what is happening to autoworkers in places like flint .
dominance to decline now , according to professor garel rhys of cardiff university , the us big three are facing their greatest challenge ever in their entire postwar history .
what has led to the decline of us car manufacturers in their home market ?
while it was inevitable they would eventually lose their monopoly position , their failure to adapt their production methods and meet changing consumer tastes has accelerated their decline .
in 1955 , the world looked like a very different place .
four out of every five cars in the world were made in the us , half of them by gm .
no other car companies had the capital or the know-how to enter the global car business .
gm 's main us rival , ford , was half its size .
the largest foreign carmaker , vw , was little bigger than gm 's own german subsidiary , opel and only had one model - the vw beetle .
and toyota was not even on the horizon .
it made 23,000 cars in 1955 in japan , compared to 4 million manufactured by gm in the us .
innovation and experiment but the near-monopoly conditions in the american market bred complacency - and the assumption that the american lead in technology and marketing was unassailable .
according to stephen d 'arcy , head of global automotive practice at pricewaterhouse coopers , in the long run " the us monopoly was an unsustainable anomoly . "
in the 1950s and 1960s , us firms failed to innovate in the design of cars , preferring to make money by increasing the size and weight of their vehicles by adding extras like air conditioning , power steering , and fancy sound systems .
it was left to european manufacturers to develop disc brakes , rack-and-pinion steering , air-cooled and diesel engines .
and the mass production system discouraged innovation because it was so expensive to introduce fundamentally new models .
meanwhile , toyota was also making a virtue of adversity , changing its production system to become leaner and more efficient than its rivals .
oil crisis it was the oil crisis in the 1970s that first illuminated the problems of us automakers . "
lean production : it is easy to say you will do it , but harder to actually implement it " james womack , author , the machine that changed the world for the first time , smaller cars were the rage , and us consumers found that cars like the toyota corolla were an attractive alternative to big american cars .
imports of japanese cars soared in the 1980s , to the chagrin of the us companies and the unions alike , taking nearly one-quarter of the us market .
and when the companies pressured the us government into limiting imports from japan , toyota and nissan started building car plants in the us .
by 2005 , these japanese " transplants " were producing 4 million cars a years , one-quarter of us output , and more than gm .
the japanese located their plants in low-wage , non-union areas of the us and brought new , more flexible production methods as well .
as a result , they could make money on smaller cars and change models more frequently .
the us car companies tried and failed to design a competitive small car .
they also experimented with japanese production methods but neither seemed to do the trick and close the quality gap .
according to james womack , author of the influential book the machine that changed the world , it was easy for everyone to say they accepted lean production , but much harder to actually implement it .
the suv craze if the 1980s was a decade of fear , the 1990s represented a false dawn .
with oil back at $ 18 a barrel , the us companies thought they had the answer to the japanese threat - the suv -lrb- sports utility vehicle -rrb- .
as light trucks , suvs were protected by a 25 % import tariff and also escaped government rules laid down to boost fuel efficiency .
suv sales soared from one to four million with 60 % of the big three 's sales - and nearly all of their profits - coming from suvs .
the suvs transformed the fortunes of chrysler , dominating with its voyager minivan and jeep grand cherokee , and ford which had the best-selling suv , the ford explorer .
abandoning cars proved a costly mistake for detroit when it became clear in recent years that environmental concerns were here to stay .
last year , the price of gasoline in the us reached a record $ 3 per gallon in most states .
as a result , suv sales slumped , and the sale of smaller vehicles rose .
at this year 's detroit auto show , ford and gm made it clear that they were taking the environment seriously , and produced electric-powered concept cars .
but these cars are years , if not decades , away from reaching the public , while toyota is already rolling out its hybrid electric-petrol engine across its entire range .
downsizing lessons in 2006 , both ford and gm finally accepted they would never dominate the us car market as in the past .
they both announced huge downsizing programmes , cutting 70,000 jobs between them .
and chrysler - now owned by german firm daimler - also announced its own downsizing programme and is effectively up for sale .
there is real doubt in the industry that all three can survive .
gm hopes to survive as a global car company which increasingly operates outside the us .
and ford may survive by selling some of its more profitable european subsidiaries .
but even if they manage this , it is sad end to what was once a central element in the american industrial dream .

dominance to decline now , according to professor garel rhys of cardiff university , the us big three are facing their greatest challenge ever in their entire postwar history .
what has led to the decline of us car manufacturers in their home market ?
while it was inevitable they would eventually lose their monopoly position , their failure to adapt their production methods and meet changing consumer tastes has accelerated their decline .
flint , michigan , gm 's production centre , was once a thriving community in 1955 , the world looked like a very different place .
four out of every five cars in the world were made in the us , half of them by gm .
no other car companies had the capital or the know-how to enter the global car business .
gm 's main us rival , ford , was half its size .
the largest foreign carmaker , vw , was little bigger than gm 's own german subsidiary , opel and only had one model - the vw beetle .
and toyota was not even on the horizon .
it made 23,000 cars in 1955 in japan , compared to 4 million manufactured by gm in the us .
innovation and experiment but the near-monopoly conditions in the american market bred complacency - and the assumption that the american lead in technology and marketing was unassailable .
ford and gm dominated the us auto industry in the l960s according to stephen d 'arcy , head of global automotive practice at pricewaterhouse coopers , in the long run " the us monopoly was an unsustainable anomoly . "
in the 1950s and 1960s , us firms failed to innovate in the design of cars , preferring to make money by increasing the size and weight of their vehicles by adding extras like air conditioning , power steering , and fancy sound systems .
it was left to european manufacturers to develop disc brakes , rack-and-pinion steering , air-cooled and diesel engines .
and the mass production system discouraged innovation because it was so expensive to introduce fundamentally new models .
meanwhile , toyota was also making a virtue of adversity , changing its production system to become leaner and more efficient than its rivals .
oil crisis it was the oil crisis in the 1970s that first illuminated the problems of us automakers .
lean production : it is easy to say you will do it , but harder to actually implement it james womack , author , the machine that changed the world for the first time , smaller cars were the rage , and us consumers found that cars like the toyota corolla were an attractive alternative to big american cars .
imports of japanese cars soared in the 1980s , to the chagrin of the us companies and the unions alike , taking nearly one-quarter of the us market .
and when the companies pressured the us government into limiting imports from japan , toyota and nissan started building car plants in the us .
by 2005 , these japanese " transplants " were producing 4 million cars a years , one-quarter of us output , and more than gm .
the japanese located their plants in low-wage , non-union areas of the us and brought new , more flexible production methods as well .
as a result , they could make money on smaller cars and change models more frequently .
the us car companies tried and failed to design a competitive small car .
they also experimented with japanese production methods but neither seemed to do the trick and close the quality gap .
according to james womack , author of the influential book the machine that changed the world , it was easy for everyone to say they accepted lean production , but much harder to actually implement it .
the suv craze if the 1980s was a decade of fear , the 1990s represented a false dawn .
with oil back at $ 18 a barrel , the us companies thought they had the answer to the japanese threat - the suv -lrb- sports utility vehicle -rrb- .
as light trucks , suvs were protected by a 25 % import tariff and also escaped government rules laid down to boost fuel efficiency .
suv sales soared from one to four million with 60 % of the big three 's sales - and nearly all of their profits - coming from suvs .
the suvs transformed the fortunes of chrysler , dominating with its voyager minivan and jeep grand cherokee , and ford which had the best-selling suv , the ford explorer .
abandoning cars proved a costly mistake for detroit when it became clear in recent years that environmental concerns were here to stay .
last year , the price of gasoline in the us reached a record $ 3 per gallon in most states .
as a result , suv sales slumped , and the sale of smaller vehicles rose .
at this year 's detroit auto show , ford and gm made it clear that they were taking the environment seriously , and produced electric-powered concept cars .
but these cars are years , if not decades , away from reaching the public , while toyota is already rolling out its hybrid electric-petrol engine across its entire range .
downsizing lessons in 2006 , both ford and gm finally accepted they would never dominate the us car market as in the past .
detroit still puts on a glitzy image at the annual motor show they both announced huge downsizing programmes , cutting 70,000 jobs between them .
and chrysler - now owned by german firm daimler - also announced its own downsizing programme and is effectively up for sale .
there is real doubt in the industry that all three can survive .
gm hopes to survive as a global car company which increasingly operates outside the us .
and ford may survive by selling some of its more profitable european subsidiaries .
but even if they manage this , it is sad end to what was once a central element in the american industrial dream .

that attitude has given them a well-deserved reputation for quality and reliability - and the camry has been the best-selling car in america for the last ten years .
toyota has no trouble hiring the right sort of workers - 100,000 people applied for the 3,000 jobs when the plant opened in 1990 .
laura says she feels sad when she reads in the papers about what is happening to autoworkers in places like flint .
dominance to decline now , according to professor garel rhys of cardiff university , the us big three are facing their greatest challenge ever in their entire postwar history .
what has led to the decline of us car manufacturers in their home market ?
while it was inevitable they would eventually lose their monopoly position , their failure to adapt their production methods and meet changing consumer tastes has accelerated their decline .
flint , michigan , gm 's production centre , was once a thriving community in 1955 , the world looked like a very different place .
four out of every five cars in the world were made in the us , half of them by gm .
no other car companies had the capital or the know-how to enter the global car business .
gm 's main us rival , ford , was half its size .
the largest foreign carmaker , vw , was little bigger than gm 's own german subsidiary , opel and only had one model - the vw beetle .
and toyota was not even on the horizon .
it made 23,000 cars in 1955 in japan , compared to 4 million manufactured by gm in the us .
innovation and experiment but the near-monopoly conditions in the american market bred complacency - and the assumption that the american lead in technology and marketing was unassailable .
ford and gm dominated the us auto industry in the l960s according to stephen d 'arcy , head of global automotive practice at pricewaterhouse coopers , in the long run " the us monopoly was an unsustainable anomoly . "
in the 1950s and 1960s , us firms failed to innovate in the design of cars , preferring to make money by increasing the size and weight of their vehicles by adding extras like air conditioning , power steering , and fancy sound systems .
it was left to european manufacturers to develop disc brakes , rack-and-pinion steering , air-cooled and diesel engines .
and the mass production system discouraged innovation because it was so expensive to introduce fundamentally new models .
meanwhile , toyota was also making a virtue of adversity , changing its production system to become leaner and more efficient than its rivals .
oil crisis it was the oil crisis in the 1970s that first illuminated the problems of us automakers .
lean production : it is easy to say you will do it , but harder to actually implement it james womack , author , the machine that changed the world for the first time , smaller cars were the rage , and us consumers found that cars like the toyota corolla were an attractive alternative to big american cars .
imports of japanese cars soared in the 1980s , to the chagrin of the us companies and the unions alike , taking nearly one-quarter of the us market .
and when the companies pressured the us government into limiting imports from japan , toyota and nissan started building car plants in the us .
by 2005 , these japanese " transplants " were producing 4 million cars a years , one-quarter of us output , and more than gm .
the japanese located their plants in low-wage , non-union areas of the us and brought new , more flexible production methods as well .
as a result , they could make money on smaller cars and change models more frequently .
the us car companies tried and failed to design a competitive small car .
they also experimented with japanese production methods but neither seemed to do the trick and close the quality gap .
according to james womack , author of the influential book the machine that changed the world , it was easy for everyone to say they accepted lean production , but much harder to actually implement it .
the suv craze if the 1980s was a decade of fear , the 1990s represented a false dawn .
with oil back at $ 18 a barrel , the us companies thought they had the answer to the japanese threat - the suv -lrb- sports utility vehicle -rrb- .
as light trucks , suvs were protected by a 25 % import tariff and also escaped government rules laid down to boost fuel efficiency .
suv sales soared from one to four million with 60 % of the big three 's sales - and nearly all of their profits - coming from suvs .
the suvs transformed the fortunes of chrysler , dominating with its voyager minivan and jeep grand cherokee , and ford which had the best-selling suv , the ford explorer .
abandoning cars proved a costly mistake for detroit when it became clear in recent years that environmental concerns were here to stay .
last year , the price of gasoline in the us reached a record $ 3 per gallon in most states .
as a result , suv sales slumped , and the sale of smaller vehicles rose .
at this year 's detroit auto show , ford and gm made it clear that they were taking the environment seriously , and produced electric-powered concept cars .
but these cars are years , if not decades , away from reaching the public , while toyota is already rolling out its hybrid electric-petrol engine across its entire range .
downsizing lessons in 2006 , both ford and gm finally accepted they would never dominate the us car market as in the past .
detroit still puts on a glitzy image at the annual motor show they both announced huge downsizing programmes , cutting 70,000 jobs between them .
and chrysler - now owned by german firm daimler - also announced its own downsizing programme and is effectively up for sale .
there is real doubt in the industry that all three can survive .
gm hopes to survive as a global car company which increasingly operates outside the us .
and ford may survive by selling some of its more profitable european subsidiaries .
but even if they manage this , it is sad end to what was once a central element in the american industrial dream .

it has affected the fate of companies as much as countries .
and nowhere has been the change more dramatic than in the us car industry .
the big three are facing their greatest challenge ever in their entire postwar history professor garel rhys , cardiff university fifty years ago , american car companies dominated the world , especially the mighty gm , the world 's biggest industrial company , many of whose factories were based in flint , michigan , 40 miles north of detroit .
gm in decline for the grandparents of claire mcclinton , who made the journey from the poverty of the rural south to michigan just after world war ii , it was like arriving in another world .
" none of their children ever went hungry , we all had a good education , we had good jobs , and owned our own home .
we thought we were living the american dream , " she told the bbc .
globalisation series how detroit lost its dominance in the global car industry wednesday : lean production next week : china 's challenge key fact : car industry what is globalisation ?
claire 's whole family followed in their footsteps and became " flintsones , " working for gm - and so did claire .
they were loyal members of the autoworkers union , the uaw , which won increasing benefits for its members , with average wages of more than $ 50,000 plus overtime .
" we respected the union then , " she said .
" we believed it was the union that had delivered us the american dream . "
in the 1950s the detroit area had the highest median income , and highest rate of home ownership , of any major us city .
but times are very different now .
gm , under pressure from its competitors , is no longer making money in the american car market - and it has been closing plants all across flint .
gm worker 's view we thought we were living the american dream claire mcclinton , third generation gm autoworker , flint , michigan now there are only 6,000 gm workers in flint , compared to 100,000 at the peak , and the town and workers are suffering .
" flint has the highest rate of unemployment , poverty and homelessness in michigan , " claire told me .
she works in a shelter feeding the poor , and would like her union to get more involved in the community .
and she is not sure how much longer she will have a job - and if she retires , whether she will have any benefits .
gm has already told the unions it wants to cut the generous retirement and health care benefits it promised its workers in the halcyon days of success .
the company does plan to build more car plants in the future - but in emerging markets like china and india , not in the united states .
compare global car firms by profits , sales , and employees toyota rising but 400 miles south of flint , another group of car workers are feeling very different .
toyota builds 500,000 cars a year at its vast kentucky plant they work in toyota 's huge camry factory in georgetown , kentucky , and receive , by their standards , generous pay and benefits .
toyota is the fastest-growing car company in the united states , and it is building a new factory every year to keep up with demand .
and it is set to overtake gm this year as the world 's largest car company by sales .
for laura wilshire , from ashland , kentucky , life is good .
" this is the top notch job in the area , " she told the bbc .
toyota worker 's view this is the top notch job in the area laura wilshire , toyota worker , georgetown , kentucky she doubled her salary when she joined toyota , and the company provides a good health care plan for her family , including dental coverage for her two children .
and she says that toyota has also helped to provide better schools for her children by putting money into the town 's budget .
she says more is expected of workers at toyota than her previous job in a convenience store , but she does n't mind taking responsibility .
" if a seatbelt is n't right , i stop the line until it is fixed - that is an important issue as it could affect people 's safety . "
toyota encourages workers to take personal responsibility for defects , and to work together to fix them .
that attitude has given them a well-deserved reputation for quality and reliability - and the camry has been the best-selling car in america for the last ten years .

they said more than $ 150m -lrb- £ 80m -rrb- was paid to trawler fleets , promoting overfishing of unviable resources .
in particular danger were slow-growing deep-sea fish and coral species caught by bottom trawling , they argued .
2006 un talks failed to implement a ban on the method , which uses heavy nets and crushing rollers on the sea floor .
" eliminating global subsidies would render these fleets economically unviable and would relieve tremendous pressure on overfishing and vulnerable deep-sea ecosystems , " said dr rashid sumaila , of the university of british columbia .
travel money eleven nations have bottom-trawling fleets , with spain 's being the biggest .
researchers at the university of british columbia estimate that without subsidies , these fleets would operate at a loss of $ 50m -lrb- £ 27m -rrb- annually .
coral clearance : bottom-trawling and its bycatch in pictures most of the subsidies were for fuel , the marine researchers said , which allows the trawlers to travel far out to sea and drag the heavy nets needed for bottom-trawling .
" there is surely a better way for governments to spend money than by paying subsidies to a fleet that burns 1.1 billion litres of fuel annually to maintain paltry catches of old-growth fish , " said dr daniel pauly , one of the researchers who has looked at the issue .
japan , south korea , russia , australia and france are amongst the other countries that subside their trawlers .
continuing payments to these fleets would inevitably lead to depleted fisheries , said dr pauly .
" you get a signal from the stock - i am old , i am rare and i am depleted , " he said .
" subsidies allow you to overlook that signal and keep fishing to the end . "
slow reproduction deep-sea species that are currently caught by deep-sea trawling methods include orange roughy , previously known as slimeheads , and patagonian toothfish , better known as chilean sea bass .
the fish were renamed to be more palatable to consumers .
cold-water species like the orange roughy are particularly at risk because they lead such long lives .
" this is a species that grows so slowly that it might not reach sexual maturity until it is 34 years old and they live to be 150 years old , " said dr selina heppell , from oregon state university .
" there is a strong correlation between living a long time and not reproducing very quickly so they are very easy to over exploit . "
the fish also tend to cluster around seamounts and cold-water coral reefs .
because deep-sea fishing methods are so indiscriminate these ecosystems can easily be destroyed .
ancient species " the corals like the fishes are extremely slow growing ; they 're also extremely long lived , " said dr murray roberts of the scottish association for marine science .
species can live for up to 2,000 years , making them the longest-lived organisms in the sea .
" these animals can live for hundreds of years but they can be removed in one sweep , " he said .
they are also important he said because the corals were an archive of past climates , locking in the chemical signatures of past sea water .
" we not only run the risk of losing a structure that supports fish but also a climate archive that we have only just begun to unravel , " said dr roberts .
slow movement last year , conservation groups and governments from countries such as the netherlands and norway argued for a ban on bottom-trawling at the united nations .
but the talks ended with only an agreement for some precautionary measures to ensure that trawlers do not cause significant damage to marine ecosystems .
the compromise declared areas where deep-sea corals and other vulnerable species occur closed to bottom-trawling , unless fishing nations can prove their activities will do no harm .
and on 2 february this year , japan , korea , russia and the us agreed to phase in a management plan for deep-sea fisheries around seamounts in the northwest pacific .
but even with these agreements , the scientists , assembled in san francisco for the american association for the advancement of science -lrb- aaas -rrb- annual meeting , believe subsides need to be scrapped .
" from an ecological perspective , we can not afford to destroy the deep sea , " said dr sumaila .
" from an economic perspective , deep-sea fisheries can not occur without government subsidies .
" the bottom line is that current deep fisheries are not sustainable . "

they said more than $ 150m -lrb- £ 80m -rrb- was paid to trawler fleets , promoting overfishing of unviable resources .
in particular danger were slow-growing deep-sea fish and coral species caught by bottom trawling , they argued .
2006 un talks failed to implement a ban on the method , which uses heavy nets and crushing rollers on the sea floor .
" eliminating global subsidies would render these fleets economically unviable and would relieve tremendous pressure on overfishing and vulnerable deep-sea ecosystems , " said dr rashid sumaila , of the university of british columbia .
travel money eleven nations have bottom-trawling fleets , with spain 's being the biggest .
researchers at the university of british columbia estimate that without subsidies , these fleets would operate at a loss of $ 50m -lrb- £ 27m -rrb- annually .
coral clearance : bottom-trawling and its bycatch in pictures most of the subsidies were for fuel , the marine researchers said , which allows the trawlers to travel far out to sea and drag the heavy nets needed for bottom-trawling .
" there is surely a better way for governments to spend money than by paying subsidies to a fleet that burns 1.1 billion litres of fuel annually to maintain paltry catches of old-growth fish , " said dr daniel pauly , one of the researchers who has looked at the issue .
japan , south korea , russia , australia and france are amongst the other countries that subside their trawlers .
continuing payments to these fleets would inevitably lead to depleted fisheries , said dr pauly .
" you get a signal from the stock - i am old , i am rare and i am depleted , " he said .
" subsidies allow you to overlook that signal and keep fishing to the end . "
slow reproduction deep-sea species that are currently caught by deep-sea trawling methods include orange roughy , previously known as slimeheads , and patagonian toothfish , better known as chilean sea bass .
the fish were renamed to be more palatable to consumers .
cold-water species like the orange roughy are particularly at risk because they lead such long lives .
" this is a species that grows so slowly that it might not reach sexual maturity until it is 34 years old and they live to be 150 years old , " said dr selina heppell , from oregon state university .
" there is a strong correlation between living a long time and not reproducing very quickly so they are very easy to over exploit . "
the fish also tend to cluster around seamounts and cold-water coral reefs .
because deep-sea fishing methods are so indiscriminate these ecosystems can easily be destroyed .
ancient species " the corals like the fishes are extremely slow growing ; they 're also extremely long lived , " said dr murray roberts of the scottish association for marine science .
species can live for up to 2,000 years , making them the longest-lived organisms in the sea .
" these animals can live for hundreds of years but they can be removed in one sweep , " he said .
they are also important he said because the corals were an archive of past climates , locking in the chemical signatures of past sea water .
" we not only run the risk of losing a structure that supports fish but also a climate archive that we have only just begun to unravel , " said dr roberts .
slow movement last year , conservation groups and governments from countries such as the netherlands and norway argued for a ban on bottom-trawling at the united nations .
but the talks ended with only an agreement for some precautionary measures to ensure that trawlers do not cause significant damage to marine ecosystems .
the compromise declared areas where deep-sea corals and other vulnerable species occur closed to bottom-trawling , unless fishing nations can prove their activities will do no harm .
and on 2 february this year , japan , korea , russia and the us agreed to phase in a management plan for deep-sea fisheries around seamounts in the northwest pacific .
but even with these agreements , the scientists , assembled in san francisco for the american association for the advancement of science -lrb- aaas -rrb- annual meeting , believe subsides need to be scrapped .
" from an ecological perspective , we can not afford to destroy the deep sea , " said dr sumaila .

hundreds of fnl supporters welcomed the 17-member team at the airport .
the ceasefire was agreed last september but both sides have accused the other of violating it .
some 300,000 people have died during burundi 's conflict .

it is not clear whether this has been granted but tanzanian and south african diplomats have been urging fnl officials in return to burundi .
fnl 's estimated 3,000 fighters are due to disarm in a process to be supervised by african union and united nations .
rubin tubirabe who is leading the fnl team , blamed the government for the delay of implementation of the ceasefire agreement .
" the fnl does not want any more fighting but it wants lasting peace for the people in burundi , " he said .
fnl leader agathon rwassa is not among the monitoring team , which includes government representatives .
the bbc 's kazungu lozy in bujumbura says residents have welcomed the fnl move and are now hopeful that the shaky relations between the government and the rebels , even after signing of the ceasefire , will improve .
