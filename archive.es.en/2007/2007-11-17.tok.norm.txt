" we have had better relations with china , that is unfortunately true , " steinmeier told journalists during a visit to paris on saturday , nov .
17 .
" what is particularly worrying for us for the time being is that the visit by the german finance minister could not happen , while dialogues on human rights and the rule of law have been cancelled . " the recent spat of cancellations are the result of china 's anger over a september meeting between the dalai lama and chancellor angela merkel , senior foreign ministry officials told reporters in berlin saturday . " it is a development that we can not let remain as is , " steinmeier said , adding that it was in germany 's interest to " reestablish good relations with china . " series of meetings cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the september meeting set off a spat of cancelled discussions german diplomats also said they feared france would exploit chinese displeasure with merkel to win favor with china , according to a report to be published monday in germany 's der speigel newsmagazine . french industrial leaders are expected to attempt to win orders away from german companies when french president nicolas sarkozy visits beijing this month .
china is germany 's biggest trade partner in the asia-pacific region . other meetings with china that have fallen to the wayside include december discussions between beijing and human rights organizations over the status of civil rights in the country . berlin had sought to play down the diplomatic row set off by the spiritual leader 's visit in after china cancelled a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück .
the finance ministry in berlin said steinbrück 's visit set for next month was called off due to his colleague 's " very busy schedule . " a strategic dialogue between the german and chinese foreign ministry secretaries , which dates back to 2006 , has also been put on ice , der spiegel reported , quoting germany 's ambassador to china , michael schaefer . merkel not alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush presented the dalai lama with the us congressional gold medal in october merkel , however , was not the only world leader to incur china 's anger over a meeting with the dalai lama .
following his visit september to berlin , the tibetan spiritual leader also traveled to the united states where he met with us president george w. bush and members of the us congress . fallout from the dalai lama visits was also blamed for china 's withdrawal from a planned meeting of world powers on the iranian nuclear crisis in october , forcing its cancellation . china , which has ruled tibet since sending in troops in 1950 , accuses the dalai lama of fuelling a separatist movement and regularly protests his meetings with the world 's political and economic elite . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

outraged stasi victims said the conference brushes over the atrocities of the gdr regime . at the two-day conference , which started saturday , nov .
17 , in danish city of odense , academics interested in east germany 's efforts to destabilize the west and advance soviet interests during the cold war were hearing the recollections of the former agents and their east berlin-based commanders . a letter of welcome from werner grossmann , head till 1989 of the stasi department that spied on the west , was read to hundreds of people at the history conference , among them about 60 former agents . " scouts for peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german secret police , or stasi , created files on thousands of people grossmann , who did not attend in person because of declining health , claimed the agents " fulfilled their mission to preserve peace . " " unlike other secret services , we did not mount coups , murders and kidnappings , " he claimed , describing the undercover agents who infiltrated the west german government and industry as " scouts for peace , " adding , " we honor you for ever more . " despite the cold war arms race , repression and the violent crushing of uprisings until the collapse of the soviet system in 1989 , communists regularly claimed they were devoted to world peace . communist east germany ran thousands of spies across the iron curtain , infiltrating " moles " deep into the west german administration until the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . danish historian thomas wegener friis , who organized the conference , said he intended the meeting , which would involve the personal reflections of the gdr 's top-level spies and political leaders , to be a scholarly examination of the daily workings of the east german intelligence services . " i leave the moral interpretation to the readers of our reports , " friis said , adding that the people directly involved in making espionage decisions in the gdr were aging and that time was running out to hear what they have to say . misguided attempt to deal with past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prison in berlin 's hohenschönhausen district is now a memorial to its victims but trying to produce an objective assessment of the former east german security apparatus by inviting its heads to speak is absurd , according to hubertus knabe , director of the memorial to victims at the former stasi prison and interrogation center in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen . " it would be like inviting osama bin laden and his followers to a conference on terrorism , " knabe said . the office that deals with the stasi archives also withdrew its support for the conference and planned to send a single " observer " to the meeting , according to andreas schulze , the archive 's spokesperson .

" we have had better relations with china , that is unfortunately true , " steinmeier told journalists during a visit to paris on saturday , nov .
17 .
" what is particularly worrying for us for the time being is that the visit by the german finance minister could not happen , while dialogues on human rights and the rule of law have been cancelled . " the recent spat of cancellations are the result of china 's anger over a september meeting between the dalai lama and chancellor angela merkel , senior foreign ministry officials told reporters in berlin saturday . " it is a development that we can not let remain as is , " steinmeier said , adding that it was in germany 's interest to " reestablish good relations with china . " series of meetings cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the september meeting set off a spat of cancelled discussions german diplomats also said they feared france would exploit chinese displeasure with merkel to win favor with china , according to a report to be published monday in germany 's der speigel newsmagazine . french industrial leaders are expected to attempt to win orders away from german companies when french president nicolas sarkozy visits beijing this month .
china is germany 's biggest trade partner in the asia-pacific region . other meetings with china that have fallen to the wayside include december discussions between beijing and human rights organizations over the status of civil rights in the country . berlin had sought to play down the diplomatic row set off by the spiritual leader 's visit in after china cancelled a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück .
the finance ministry in berlin said steinbrück 's visit set for next month was called off due to his colleague 's " very busy schedule . " a strategic dialogue between the german and chinese foreign ministry secretaries , which dates back to 2006 , has also been put on ice , der spiegel reported , quoting germany 's ambassador to china , michael schaefer . merkel not alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush presented the dalai lama with the us congressional gold medal in october merkel , however , was not the only world leader to incur china 's anger over a meeting with the dalai lama .
following his visit september to berlin , the tibetan spiritual leader also traveled to the united states where he met with us president george w. bush and members of the us congress . fallout from the dalai lama visits was also blamed for china 's withdrawal from a planned meeting of world powers on the iranian nuclear crisis in october , forcing its cancellation . china , which has ruled tibet since sending in troops in 1950 , accuses the dalai lama of fuelling a separatist movement and regularly protests his meetings with the world 's political and economic elite . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

outraged stasi victims said the conference brushes over the atrocities of the gdr regime . at the two-day conference , which started saturday , nov .
17 , in danish city of odense , academics interested in east germany 's efforts to destabilize the west and advance soviet interests during the cold war were hearing the recollections of the former agents and their east berlin-based commanders . a letter of welcome from werner grossmann , head till 1989 of the stasi department that spied on the west , was read to hundreds of people at the history conference , among them about 60 former agents . " scouts for peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german secret police , or stasi , created files on thousands of people grossmann , who did not attend in person because of declining health , claimed the agents " fulfilled their mission to preserve peace . " " unlike other secret services , we did not mount coups , murders and kidnappings , " he claimed , describing the undercover agents who infiltrated the west german government and industry as " scouts for peace , " adding , " we honor you for ever more . " despite the cold war arms race , repression and the violent crushing of uprisings until the collapse of the soviet system in 1989 , communists regularly claimed they were devoted to world peace . communist east germany ran thousands of spies across the iron curtain , infiltrating " moles " deep into the west german administration until the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . danish historian thomas wegener friis , who organized the conference , said he intended the meeting , which would involve the personal reflections of the gdr 's top-level spies and political leaders , to be a scholarly examination of the daily workings of the east german intelligence services . " i leave the moral interpretation to the readers of our reports , " friis said , adding that the people directly involved in making espionage decisions in the gdr were aging and that time was running out to hear what they have to say . misguided attempt to deal with past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prison in berlin 's hohenschönhausen district is now a memorial to its victims but trying to produce an objective assessment of the former east german security apparatus by inviting its heads to speak is absurd , according to hubertus knabe , director of the memorial to victims at the former stasi prison and interrogation center in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen . " it would be like inviting osama bin laden and his followers to a conference on terrorism , " knabe said . the office that deals with the stasi archives also withdrew its support for the conference and planned to send a single " observer " to the meeting , according to andreas schulze , the archive 's spokesperson . " these old stasi generals have no idea of what they have done , " he told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" for them it is about acquitting themselves and fighting over who was at fault . " bad sense of timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the june 17 protests resulted in the deaths of at least 55 people friis , a professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense , had originally tried to hold the conference in berlin on june 17 .
but that meeting was called off after a public outcry , with the state-run archives containing the files of the east german stasi spy agency cancelling all cooperation with the retired spies . on june 17 , 1953 , the former gdr government , armed with soviet tanks , violently crushed an uprising on the streets of then east berlin killing 55 people .
the demonstration , which began to fight a cut in wages , quickly grew to involve over a million east germans who took to the streets in hundreds of towns and communities and called for freedom , democracy and unity in germany . in the days following , some 10,000 protesters and members of the strike committee were arrested .
at least two cases can be proven where people were sentenced to death .
more than 1,500 protesters were given lengthy prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" these scenes are as frightening as a science fiction movie , " he said .
" but they are even more terrifying , because they are real . " the 23-page document by the un-backed panel of scientists , issued saturday , nov .
17 , contained the strongest warnings yet on climate change and " answered many of our questions on climate change , " the secretary general said . new ethic required ipcc chairman rajendra pachauri pointed out several findings , including the threat rising sea levels posed to small island nations and hundreds of millions of people living in low-lying deltas as well as more infectious diseases and the destruction of coral reefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon had recently been on a trip to see ice shelves breaking up in antarctica " we need a new ethic by which every human being realizes the importance of the challenge we are facing and starts to take action through changes in lifestyle and attitude , " he said .
" every country in the world has to be committed to a shared vision and a set of common goals and actions that will help us move toward a much lower level of emissions . " ban added that the international community would now have to " transform " its way of doing things in order to save the " treasure of our planet . " the final report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change is essentially a summary of three reports compiled by more than 2,000 scientists and issued by the ipcc earlier this year . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said the report was " a milestone in our scientific knowledge about climate change and the grave threats global warming poses to the planet . " " the report 's findings amount to a stark warning that the world must act fast to slash greenhouse gas emissions if we are to prevent climate change from reaching devastating levels , " he said in a statement .
" the good news is that it also shows that deep emission cuts are both technologically feasible and economically affordable . " basis for bali conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change wo n't spare any regions of the world , the ipcc report said governments haggled for five days over the wording of this final ipcc document , which environmentalists say will serve as a manual on how to tackle global warming and set the tone for a crucial un climate conference in bali , indonesia next month . " we can not afford to leave bali without such a breakthrough , " ban said , referring to a conference running on the indonesian island from dec .
3-14 , tasked with setting a strategy for deepening cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions . government representatives at the bali conference are expected to negotiate a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which requires industrialized countries to make targeted commitments on curbing their greenhouse gases and expires in 2012 . the new ipcc report makes clear that global warming is a man-made phenomenon and is already taking place .
it warns of catastrophic and unavoidable consequences if the atmosphere warms by more than 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees f -rrb- .
global temperatures have already risen about 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years . global warming can only be slowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un council said greenhouse gas emissions needed to drop by at least 50 percent by 2050 to prevent that , the level of carbon dioxide in the world 's atmosphere must start dropping by 2020 .
by 2050 , global emissions must be 50 percent to 65 percent below 2000 levels .
the ipcc has already said global warming can not be stopped , only slowed . melting glaciers and loss of snow in alpine regions as well as thinning arctic summer sea ice and thawing permafrost shows that climate change is already on the march , the ipcc report said . some of the newer elements of the report include one combined graphic that at a glance lays out specifically what levels of greenhouse gases lead to what rises in temperatures - and what consequences each temperature rise could have on society . environmental groups pleased representatives from environmental protection groups appeared pleased with the study 's results . " the strong message of the ipcc ca n't be watered down - the science is crystal clear , " said hans verolme , director of environmental group wwf 's global climate change program .
" the hard fact is we have caused climate change , and it 's also clear that we hold the solution to stop global warming in our hands , " the ipcc was last month awarded the nobel peace prize , along with former us vice president al gore , for raising awareness of the threat of climate change . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , in danish city of odense , academics interested in east germany 's efforts to destabilize the west and advance soviet interests during the cold war were hearing the recollections of the former agents and their east berlin-based commanders . a letter of welcome from werner grossmann , head till 1989 of the stasi department that spied on the west , was read to hundreds of people at the history conference , among them about 60 former agents . " scouts for peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german secret police , or stasi , created files on thousands of people grossmann , who did not attend in person because of declining health , claimed the agents " fulfilled their mission to preserve peace . " " unlike other secret services , we did not mount coups , murders and kidnappings , " he claimed , describing the undercover agents who infiltrated the west german government and industry as " scouts for peace , " adding , " we honor you for ever more . " despite the cold war arms race , repression and the violent crushing of uprisings until the collapse of the soviet system in 1989 , communists regularly claimed they were devoted to world peace . communist east germany ran thousands of spies across the iron curtain , infiltrating " moles " deep into the west german administration until the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . danish historian thomas wegener friis , who organized the conference , said he intended the meeting , which would involve the personal reflections of the gdr 's top-level spies and political leaders , to be a scholarly examination of the daily workings of the east german intelligence services . " i leave the moral interpretation to the readers of our reports , " friis said , adding that the people directly involved in making espionage decisions in the gdr were aging and that time was running out to hear what they have to say . misguided attempt to deal with past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prison in berlin 's hohenschönhausen district is now a memorial to its victims but trying to produce an objective assessment of the former east german security apparatus by inviting its heads to speak is absurd , according to hubertus knabe , director of the memorial to victims at the former stasi prison and interrogation center in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen . " it would be like inviting osama bin laden and his followers to a conference on terrorism , " knabe said . the office that deals with the stasi archives also withdrew its support for the conference and planned to send a single " observer " to the meeting , according to andreas schulze , the archive 's spokesperson . " these old stasi generals have no idea of what they have done , " he told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" for them it is about acquitting themselves and fighting over who was at fault .

but that meeting was called off after a public outcry , with the state-run archives containing the files of the east german stasi spy agency cancelling all cooperation with the retired spies . on june 17 , 1953 , the former gdr government , armed with soviet tanks , violently crushed an uprising on the streets of then east berlin killing 55 people .
the demonstration , which began to fight a cut in wages , quickly grew to involve over a million east germans who took to the streets in hundreds of towns and communities and called for freedom , democracy and unity in germany . in the days following , some 10,000 protesters and members of the strike committee were arrested .

" scouts for peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german secret police , or stasi , created files on thousands of people grossmann , who did not attend in person because of declining health , claimed the agents " fulfilled their mission to preserve peace . " " unlike other secret services , we did not mount coups , murders and kidnappings , " he claimed , describing the undercover agents who infiltrated the west german government and industry as " scouts for peace , " adding , " we honor you for ever more . " despite the cold war arms race , repression and the violent crushing of uprisings until the collapse of the soviet system in 1989 , communists regularly claimed they were devoted to world peace . communist east germany ran thousands of spies across the iron curtain , infiltrating " moles " deep into the west german administration until the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . danish historian thomas wegener friis , who organized the conference , said he intended the meeting , which would involve the personal reflections of the gdr 's top-level spies and political leaders , to be a scholarly examination of the daily workings of the east german intelligence services . " i leave the moral interpretation to the readers of our reports , " friis said , adding that the people directly involved in making espionage decisions in the gdr were aging and that time was running out to hear what they have to say . misguided attempt to deal with past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prison in berlin 's hohenschönhausen district is now a memorial to its victims but trying to produce an objective assessment of the former east german security apparatus by inviting its heads to speak is absurd , according to hubertus knabe , director of the memorial to victims at the former stasi prison and interrogation center in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen . " it would be like inviting osama bin laden and his followers to a conference on terrorism , " knabe said . the office that deals with the stasi archives also withdrew its support for the conference and planned to send a single " observer " to the meeting , according to andreas schulze , the archive 's spokesperson . " these old stasi generals have no idea of what they have done , " he told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" for them it is about acquitting themselves and fighting over who was at fault . " bad sense of timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the june 17 protests resulted in the deaths of at least 55 people friis , a professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense , had originally tried to hold the conference in berlin on june 17 .
but that meeting was called off after a public outcry , with the state-run archives containing the files of the east german stasi spy agency cancelling all cooperation with the retired spies . on june 17 , 1953 , the former gdr government , armed with soviet tanks , violently crushed an uprising on the streets of then east berlin killing 55 people .
the demonstration , which began to fight a cut in wages , quickly grew to involve over a million east germans who took to the streets in hundreds of towns and communities and called for freedom , democracy and unity in germany . in the days following , some 10,000 protesters and members of the strike committee were arrested .

outraged stasi victims said the conference brushes over the atrocities of the gdr regime . at the two-day conference , which started saturday , nov .
17 , in danish city of odense , academics interested in east germany 's efforts to destabilize the west and advance soviet interests during the cold war were hearing the recollections of the former agents and their east berlin-based commanders . a letter of welcome from werner grossmann , head till 1989 of the stasi department that spied on the west , was read to hundreds of people at the history conference , among them about 60 former agents . " scouts for peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german secret police , or stasi , created files on thousands of people grossmann , who did not attend in person because of declining health , claimed the agents " fulfilled their mission to preserve peace . " " unlike other secret services , we did not mount coups , murders and kidnappings , " he claimed , describing the undercover agents who infiltrated the west german government and industry as " scouts for peace , " adding , " we honor you for ever more . " despite the cold war arms race , repression and the violent crushing of uprisings until the collapse of the soviet system in 1989 , communists regularly claimed they were devoted to world peace . communist east germany ran thousands of spies across the iron curtain , infiltrating " moles " deep into the west german administration until the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . danish historian thomas wegener friis , who organized the conference , said he intended the meeting , which would involve the personal reflections of the gdr 's top-level spies and political leaders , to be a scholarly examination of the daily workings of the east german intelligence services . " i leave the moral interpretation to the readers of our reports , " friis said , adding that the people directly involved in making espionage decisions in the gdr were aging and that time was running out to hear what they have to say . misguided attempt to deal with past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prison in berlin 's hohenschönhausen district is now a memorial to its victims but trying to produce an objective assessment of the former east german security apparatus by inviting its heads to speak is absurd , according to hubertus knabe , director of the memorial to victims at the former stasi prison and interrogation center in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen . " it would be like inviting osama bin laden and his followers to a conference on terrorism , " knabe said . the office that deals with the stasi archives also withdrew its support for the conference and planned to send a single " observer " to the meeting , according to andreas schulze , the archive 's spokesperson . " these old stasi generals have no idea of what they have done , " he told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" for them it is about acquitting themselves and fighting over who was at fault . " bad sense of timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the june 17 protests resulted in the deaths of at least 55 people friis , a professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense , had originally tried to hold the conference in berlin on june 17 .
but that meeting was called off after a public outcry , with the state-run archives containing the files of the east german stasi spy agency cancelling all cooperation with the retired spies . on june 17 , 1953 , the former gdr government , armed with soviet tanks , violently crushed an uprising on the streets of then east berlin killing 55 people .
the demonstration , which began to fight a cut in wages , quickly grew to involve over a million east germans who took to the streets in hundreds of towns and communities and called for freedom , democracy and unity in germany . in the days following , some 10,000 protesters and members of the strike committee were arrested .
at least two cases can be proven where people were sentenced to death .
more than 1,500 protesters were given lengthy prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

outraged stasi victims said the conference brushes over the atrocities of the gdr regime . at the two-day conference , which started saturday , nov .
17 , in danish city of odense , academics interested in east germany 's efforts to destabilize the west and advance soviet interests during the cold war were hearing the recollections of the former agents and their east berlin-based commanders . a letter of welcome from werner grossmann , head till 1989 of the stasi department that spied on the west , was read to hundreds of people at the history conference , among them about 60 former agents . " scouts for peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german secret police , or stasi , created files on thousands of people grossmann , who did not attend in person because of declining health , claimed the agents " fulfilled their mission to preserve peace . " " unlike other secret services , we did not mount coups , murders and kidnappings , " he claimed , describing the undercover agents who infiltrated the west german government and industry as " scouts for peace , " adding , " we honor you for ever more . " despite the cold war arms race , repression and the violent crushing of uprisings until the collapse of the soviet system in 1989 , communists regularly claimed they were devoted to world peace . communist east germany ran thousands of spies across the iron curtain , infiltrating " moles " deep into the west german administration until the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . danish historian thomas wegener friis , who organized the conference , said he intended the meeting , which would involve the personal reflections of the gdr 's top-level spies and political leaders , to be a scholarly examination of the daily workings of the east german intelligence services . " i leave the moral interpretation to the readers of our reports , " friis said , adding that the people directly involved in making espionage decisions in the gdr were aging and that time was running out to hear what they have to say . misguided attempt to deal with past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prison in berlin 's hohenschönhausen district is now a memorial to its victims but trying to produce an objective assessment of the former east german security apparatus by inviting its heads to speak is absurd , according to hubertus knabe , director of the memorial to victims at the former stasi prison and interrogation center in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen . " it would be like inviting osama bin laden and his followers to a conference on terrorism , " knabe said . the office that deals with the stasi archives also withdrew its support for the conference and planned to send a single " observer " to the meeting , according to andreas schulze , the archive 's spokesperson . " these old stasi generals have no idea of what they have done , " he told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" for them it is about acquitting themselves and fighting over who was at fault . " bad sense of timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the june 17 protests resulted in the deaths of at least 55 people friis , a professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense , had originally tried to hold the conference in berlin on june 17 .
but that meeting was called off after a public outcry , with the state-run archives containing the files of the east german stasi spy agency cancelling all cooperation with the retired spies . on june 17 , 1953 , the former gdr government , armed with soviet tanks , violently crushed an uprising on the streets of then east berlin killing 55 people .
the demonstration , which began to fight a cut in wages , quickly grew to involve over a million east germans who took to the streets in hundreds of towns and communities and called for freedom , democracy and unity in germany . in the days following , some 10,000 protesters and members of the strike committee were arrested .
at least two cases can be proven where people were sentenced to death .
more than 1,500 protesters were given lengthy prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china is germany 's biggest trade partner in the asia-pacific region . other meetings with china that have fallen to the wayside include december discussions between beijing and human rights organizations over the status of civil rights in the country . berlin had sought to play down the diplomatic row set off by the spiritual leader 's visit in after china cancelled a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück .
the finance ministry in berlin said steinbrück 's visit set for next month was called off due to his colleague 's " very busy schedule . " a strategic dialogue between the german and chinese foreign ministry secretaries , which dates back to 2006 , has also been put on ice , der spiegel reported , quoting germany 's ambassador to china , michael schaefer . merkel not alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush presented the dalai lama with the us congressional gold medal in october merkel , however , was not the only world leader to incur china 's anger over a meeting with the dalai lama .

" these scenes are as frightening as a science fiction movie , " he said .
" but they are even more terrifying , because they are real . " the 23-page document by the un-backed panel of scientists , issued saturday , nov .
17 , contained the strongest warnings yet on climate change and " answered many of our questions on climate change , " the secretary general said . new ethic required ipcc chairman rajendra pachauri pointed out several findings , including the threat rising sea levels posed to small island nations and hundreds of millions of people living in low-lying deltas as well as more infectious diseases and the destruction of coral reefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon had recently been on a trip to see ice shelves breaking up in antarctica " we need a new ethic by which every human being realizes the importance of the challenge we are facing and starts to take action through changes in lifestyle and attitude , " he said .
" every country in the world has to be committed to a shared vision and a set of common goals and actions that will help us move toward a much lower level of emissions . " ban added that the international community would now have to " transform " its way of doing things in order to save the " treasure of our planet . " the final report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change is essentially a summary of three reports compiled by more than 2,000 scientists and issued by the ipcc earlier this year . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said the report was " a milestone in our scientific knowledge about climate change and the grave threats global warming poses to the planet . " " the report 's findings amount to a stark warning that the world must act fast to slash greenhouse gas emissions if we are to prevent climate change from reaching devastating levels , " he said in a statement .
" the good news is that it also shows that deep emission cuts are both technologically feasible and economically affordable . " basis for bali conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change wo n't spare any regions of the world , the ipcc report said governments haggled for five days over the wording of this final ipcc document , which environmentalists say will serve as a manual on how to tackle global warming and set the tone for a crucial un climate conference in bali , indonesia next month . " we can not afford to leave bali without such a breakthrough , " ban said , referring to a conference running on the indonesian island from dec .
3-14 , tasked with setting a strategy for deepening cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions . government representatives at the bali conference are expected to negotiate a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which requires industrialized countries to make targeted commitments on curbing their greenhouse gases and expires in 2012 . the new ipcc report makes clear that global warming is a man-made phenomenon and is already taking place .
it warns of catastrophic and unavoidable consequences if the atmosphere warms by more than 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees f -rrb- .
global temperatures have already risen about 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years . global warming can only be slowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un council said greenhouse gas emissions needed to drop by at least 50 percent by 2050 to prevent that , the level of carbon dioxide in the world 's atmosphere must start dropping by 2020 .
by 2050 , global emissions must be 50 percent to 65 percent below 2000 levels .
the ipcc has already said global warming can not be stopped , only slowed . melting glaciers and loss of snow in alpine regions as well as thinning arctic summer sea ice and thawing permafrost shows that climate change is already on the march , the ipcc report said . some of the newer elements of the report include one combined graphic that at a glance lays out specifically what levels of greenhouse gases lead to what rises in temperatures - and what consequences each temperature rise could have on society . environmental groups pleased representatives from environmental protection groups appeared pleased with the study 's results . " the strong message of the ipcc ca n't be watered down - the science is crystal clear , " said hans verolme , director of environmental group wwf 's global climate change program .
" the hard fact is we have caused climate change , and it 's also clear that we hold the solution to stop global warming in our hands , " the ipcc was last month awarded the nobel peace prize , along with former us vice president al gore , for raising awareness of the threat of climate change . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what is particularly worrying for us for the time being is that the visit by the german finance minister could not happen , while dialogues on human rights and the rule of law have been cancelled .

" these scenes are as frightening as a science fiction movie , " he said .
" but they are even more terrifying , because they are real . " the 23-page document by the un-backed panel of scientists , issued saturday , nov .
17 , contained the strongest warnings yet on climate change and " answered many of our questions on climate change , " the secretary general said . new ethic required ipcc chairman rajendra pachauri pointed out several findings , including the threat rising sea levels posed to small island nations and hundreds of millions of people living in low-lying deltas as well as more infectious diseases and the destruction of coral reefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon had recently been on a trip to see ice shelves breaking up in antarctica " we need a new ethic by which every human being realizes the importance of the challenge we are facing and starts to take action through changes in lifestyle and attitude , " he said .
" every country in the world has to be committed to a shared vision and a set of common goals and actions that will help us move toward a much lower level of emissions . " ban added that the international community would now have to " transform " its way of doing things in order to save the " treasure of our planet . " the final report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change is essentially a summary of three reports compiled by more than 2,000 scientists and issued by the ipcc earlier this year . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said the report was " a milestone in our scientific knowledge about climate change and the grave threats global warming poses to the planet . " " the report 's findings amount to a stark warning that the world must act fast to slash greenhouse gas emissions if we are to prevent climate change from reaching devastating levels , " he said in a statement .
" the good news is that it also shows that deep emission cuts are both technologically feasible and economically affordable . " basis for bali conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change wo n't spare any regions of the world , the ipcc report said governments haggled for five days over the wording of this final ipcc document , which environmentalists say will serve as a manual on how to tackle global warming and set the tone for a crucial un climate conference in bali , indonesia next month . " we can not afford to leave bali without such a breakthrough , " ban said , referring to a conference running on the indonesian island from dec .
3-14 , tasked with setting a strategy for deepening cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions . government representatives at the bali conference are expected to negotiate a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which requires industrialized countries to make targeted commitments on curbing their greenhouse gases and expires in 2012 . the new ipcc report makes clear that global warming is a man-made phenomenon and is already taking place .
it warns of catastrophic and unavoidable consequences if the atmosphere warms by more than 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees f -rrb- .
global temperatures have already risen about 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years . global warming can only be slowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un council said greenhouse gas emissions needed to drop by at least 50 percent by 2050 to prevent that , the level of carbon dioxide in the world 's atmosphere must start dropping by 2020 .
by 2050 , global emissions must be 50 percent to 65 percent below 2000 levels .
the ipcc has already said global warming can not be stopped , only slowed . melting glaciers and loss of snow in alpine regions as well as thinning arctic summer sea ice and thawing permafrost shows that climate change is already on the march , the ipcc report said . some of the newer elements of the report include one combined graphic that at a glance lays out specifically what levels of greenhouse gases lead to what rises in temperatures - and what consequences each temperature rise could have on society . environmental groups pleased representatives from environmental protection groups appeared pleased with the study 's results . " the strong message of the ipcc ca n't be watered down - the science is crystal clear , " said hans verolme , director of environmental group wwf 's global climate change program .
" the hard fact is we have caused climate change , and it 's also clear that we hold the solution to stop global warming in our hands , " the ipcc was last month awarded the nobel peace prize , along with former us vice president al gore , for raising awareness of the threat of climate change . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

outraged stasi victims said the conference brushes over the atrocities of the gdr regime . at the two-day conference , which started saturday , nov .
17 , in danish city of odense , academics interested in east germany 's efforts to destabilize the west and advance soviet interests during the cold war were hearing the recollections of the former agents and their east berlin-based commanders . a letter of welcome from werner grossmann , head till 1989 of the stasi department that spied on the west , was read to hundreds of people at the history conference , among them about 60 former agents . " scouts for peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german secret police , or stasi , created files on thousands of people grossmann , who did not attend in person because of declining health , claimed the agents " fulfilled their mission to preserve peace . " " unlike other secret services , we did not mount coups , murders and kidnappings , " he claimed , describing the undercover agents who infiltrated the west german government and industry as " scouts for peace , " adding , " we honor you for ever more . " despite the cold war arms race , repression and the violent crushing of uprisings until the collapse of the soviet system in 1989 , communists regularly claimed they were devoted to world peace . communist east germany ran thousands of spies across the iron curtain , infiltrating " moles " deep into the west german administration until the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . danish historian thomas wegener friis , who organized the conference , said he intended the meeting , which would involve the personal reflections of the gdr 's top-level spies and political leaders , to be a scholarly examination of the daily workings of the east german intelligence services . " i leave the moral interpretation to the readers of our reports , " friis said , adding that the people directly involved in making espionage decisions in the gdr were aging and that time was running out to hear what they have to say . misguided attempt to deal with past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prison in berlin 's hohenschönhausen district is now a memorial to its victims but trying to produce an objective assessment of the former east german security apparatus by inviting its heads to speak is absurd , according to hubertus knabe , director of the memorial to victims at the former stasi prison and interrogation center in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen . " it would be like inviting osama bin laden and his followers to a conference on terrorism , " knabe said . the office that deals with the stasi archives also withdrew its support for the conference and planned to send a single " observer " to the meeting , according to andreas schulze , the archive 's spokesperson . " these old stasi generals have no idea of what they have done , " he told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" for them it is about acquitting themselves and fighting over who was at fault . " bad sense of timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the june 17 protests resulted in the deaths of at least 55 people friis , a professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense , had originally tried to hold the conference in berlin on june 17 .
but that meeting was called off after a public outcry , with the state-run archives containing the files of the east german stasi spy agency cancelling all cooperation with the retired spies . on june 17 , 1953 , the former gdr government , armed with soviet tanks , violently crushed an uprising on the streets of then east berlin killing 55 people .
the demonstration , which began to fight a cut in wages , quickly grew to involve over a million east germans who took to the streets in hundreds of towns and communities and called for freedom , democracy and unity in germany . in the days following , some 10,000 protesters and members of the strike committee were arrested .
at least two cases can be proven where people were sentenced to death .
more than 1,500 protesters were given lengthy prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" these scenes are as frightening as a science fiction movie , " he said .
" but they are even more terrifying , because they are real . " the 23-page document by the un-backed panel of scientists , issued saturday , nov .
17 , contained the strongest warnings yet on climate change and " answered many of our questions on climate change , " the secretary general said . new ethic required ipcc chairman rajendra pachauri pointed out several findings , including the threat rising sea levels posed to small island nations and hundreds of millions of people living in low-lying deltas as well as more infectious diseases and the destruction of coral reefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon had recently been on a trip to see ice shelves breaking up in antarctica " we need a new ethic by which every human being realizes the importance of the challenge we are facing and starts to take action through changes in lifestyle and attitude , " he said .
" every country in the world has to be committed to a shared vision and a set of common goals and actions that will help us move toward a much lower level of emissions . " ban added that the international community would now have to " transform " its way of doing things in order to save the " treasure of our planet . " the final report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change is essentially a summary of three reports compiled by more than 2,000 scientists and issued by the ipcc earlier this year . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said the report was " a milestone in our scientific knowledge about climate change and the grave threats global warming poses to the planet . " " the report 's findings amount to a stark warning that the world must act fast to slash greenhouse gas emissions if we are to prevent climate change from reaching devastating levels , " he said in a statement .
" the good news is that it also shows that deep emission cuts are both technologically feasible and economically affordable . " basis for bali conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change wo n't spare any regions of the world , the ipcc report said governments haggled for five days over the wording of this final ipcc document , which environmentalists say will serve as a manual on how to tackle global warming and set the tone for a crucial un climate conference in bali , indonesia next month . " we can not afford to leave bali without such a breakthrough , " ban said , referring to a conference running on the indonesian island from dec .
3-14 , tasked with setting a strategy for deepening cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions . government representatives at the bali conference are expected to negotiate a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which requires industrialized countries to make targeted commitments on curbing their greenhouse gases and expires in 2012 . the new ipcc report makes clear that global warming is a man-made phenomenon and is already taking place .
it warns of catastrophic and unavoidable consequences if the atmosphere warms by more than 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees f -rrb- .
global temperatures have already risen about 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years . global warming can only be slowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un council said greenhouse gas emissions needed to drop by at least 50 percent by 2050 to prevent that , the level of carbon dioxide in the world 's atmosphere must start dropping by 2020 .
by 2050 , global emissions must be 50 percent to 65 percent below 2000 levels .
the ipcc has already said global warming can not be stopped , only slowed . melting glaciers and loss of snow in alpine regions as well as thinning arctic summer sea ice and thawing permafrost shows that climate change is already on the march , the ipcc report said . some of the newer elements of the report include one combined graphic that at a glance lays out specifically what levels of greenhouse gases lead to what rises in temperatures - and what consequences each temperature rise could have on society . environmental groups pleased representatives from environmental protection groups appeared pleased with the study 's results . " the strong message of the ipcc ca n't be watered down - the science is crystal clear , " said hans verolme , director of environmental group wwf 's global climate change program .

" scouts for peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german secret police , or stasi , created files on thousands of people grossmann , who did not attend in person because of declining health , claimed the agents " fulfilled their mission to preserve peace . " " unlike other secret services , we did not mount coups , murders and kidnappings , " he claimed , describing the undercover agents who infiltrated the west german government and industry as " scouts for peace , " adding , " we honor you for ever more . " despite the cold war arms race , repression and the violent crushing of uprisings until the collapse of the soviet system in 1989 , communists regularly claimed they were devoted to world peace . communist east germany ran thousands of spies across the iron curtain , infiltrating " moles " deep into the west german administration until the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . danish historian thomas wegener friis , who organized the conference , said he intended the meeting , which would involve the personal reflections of the gdr 's top-level spies and political leaders , to be a scholarly examination of the daily workings of the east german intelligence services . " i leave the moral interpretation to the readers of our reports , " friis said , adding that the people directly involved in making espionage decisions in the gdr were aging and that time was running out to hear what they have to say . misguided attempt to deal with past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former prison in berlin 's hohenschönhausen district is now a memorial to its victims but trying to produce an objective assessment of the former east german security apparatus by inviting its heads to speak is absurd , according to hubertus knabe , director of the memorial to victims at the former stasi prison and interrogation center in the berlin district of hohenschönhausen . " it would be like inviting osama bin laden and his followers to a conference on terrorism , " knabe said . the office that deals with the stasi archives also withdrew its support for the conference and planned to send a single " observer " to the meeting , according to andreas schulze , the archive 's spokesperson . " these old stasi generals have no idea of what they have done , " he told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" for them it is about acquitting themselves and fighting over who was at fault . " bad sense of timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the june 17 protests resulted in the deaths of at least 55 people friis , a professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense , had originally tried to hold the conference in berlin on june 17 .
but that meeting was called off after a public outcry , with the state-run archives containing the files of the east german stasi spy agency cancelling all cooperation with the retired spies . on june 17 , 1953 , the former gdr government , armed with soviet tanks , violently crushed an uprising on the streets of then east berlin killing 55 people .
the demonstration , which began to fight a cut in wages , quickly grew to involve over a million east germans who took to the streets in hundreds of towns and communities and called for freedom , democracy and unity in germany . in the days following , some 10,000 protesters and members of the strike committee were arrested .
at least two cases can be proven where people were sentenced to death .
more than 1,500 protesters were given lengthy prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it would be like inviting osama bin laden and his followers to a conference on terrorism , " knabe said . the office that deals with the stasi archives also withdrew its support for the conference and planned to send a single " observer " to the meeting , according to andreas schulze , the archive 's spokesperson . " these old stasi generals have no idea of what they have done , " he told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" for them it is about acquitting themselves and fighting over who was at fault . " bad sense of timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the june 17 protests resulted in the deaths of at least 55 people friis , a professor at the center for cold war studies at the university of southern denmark in odense , had originally tried to hold the conference in berlin on june 17 .
but that meeting was called off after a public outcry , with the state-run archives containing the files of the east german stasi spy agency cancelling all cooperation with the retired spies . on june 17 , 1953 , the former gdr government , armed with soviet tanks , violently crushed an uprising on the streets of then east berlin killing 55 people .
the demonstration , which began to fight a cut in wages , quickly grew to involve over a million east germans who took to the streets in hundreds of towns and communities and called for freedom , democracy and unity in germany . in the days following , some 10,000 protesters and members of the strike committee were arrested .
at least two cases can be proven where people were sentenced to death .
more than 1,500 protesters were given lengthy prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have had better relations with china , that is unfortunately true , " steinmeier told journalists during a visit to paris on saturday , nov .
17 .
" what is particularly worrying for us for the time being is that the visit by the german finance minister could not happen , while dialogues on human rights and the rule of law have been cancelled . " the recent spat of cancellations are the result of china 's anger over a september meeting between the dalai lama and chancellor angela merkel , senior foreign ministry officials told reporters in berlin saturday . " it is a development that we can not let remain as is , " steinmeier said , adding that it was in germany 's interest to " reestablish good relations with china . " series of meetings cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the september meeting set off a spat of cancelled discussions german diplomats also said they feared france would exploit chinese displeasure with merkel to win favor with china , according to a report to be published monday in germany 's der speigel newsmagazine . french industrial leaders are expected to attempt to win orders away from german companies when french president nicolas sarkozy visits beijing this month .
china is germany 's biggest trade partner in the asia-pacific region . other meetings with china that have fallen to the wayside include december discussions between beijing and human rights organizations over the status of civil rights in the country . berlin had sought to play down the diplomatic row set off by the spiritual leader 's visit in after china cancelled a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück .
the finance ministry in berlin said steinbrück 's visit set for next month was called off due to his colleague 's " very busy schedule . " a strategic dialogue between the german and chinese foreign ministry secretaries , which dates back to 2006 , has also been put on ice , der spiegel reported , quoting germany 's ambassador to china , michael schaefer . merkel not alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush presented the dalai lama with the us congressional gold medal in october merkel , however , was not the only world leader to incur china 's anger over a meeting with the dalai lama .
following his visit september to berlin , the tibetan spiritual leader also traveled to the united states where he met with us president george w. bush and members of the us congress . fallout from the dalai lama visits was also blamed for china 's withdrawal from a planned meeting of world powers on the iranian nuclear crisis in october , forcing its cancellation . china , which has ruled tibet since sending in troops in 1950 , accuses the dalai lama of fuelling a separatist movement and regularly protests his meetings with the world 's political and economic elite . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 25-year-old drummer with a " big laugh " was one of the 31 people who lost their lives during the king 's cross fire on 18 november , 1987 .
after his death , his older sister sophie headed the king 's cross family action group - a support organisation for the injured and bereaved .
but 20 years on , the grieving process has reached a new stage .
last moments " it 's become more about my brother and less about the fire , " said the law lecturer from her home in kensal green , north-west london .
the " penniless " musician changed tubes at king 's cross station to make his way to a rehearsal in notting hill .
by chance , sophie was also in the area .
" i was going to meet a friend outside the station at 8pm but trains were not stopping at king 's cross .
" i got off at russell square and got close to where i was meeting my friend when i saw ambulances and the fire brigade - i had no idea my brother was inside . "
two days later , she and her older brother formally identified ivan 's body .
" that was hell , " she said .
" but he was n't a pile of ashes , i could still recognise him . "
much publicity followed in the aftermath as she desperately tried in vain to establish ivan 's last moments . "
for the first three months i cried every day " sophie tarassenko " my older brother is a scientist and he did weird stuff after ivan 's death , " she said .
" he worked out the mathematical probability that ivan would be there at that time .
" it was so close to zero that it was mathematically irrelevant .
" my way of processing it was to have a co-existence in my head of being really angry but accepting that it was his time and there 's nothing that can be done about it - sort of a zen way if you like . "
she added : " for the first three months i cried every day .
the next three months i cried every other day .
the next couple of years i cried once a month and after 20 years i cry two or three times a year .
but it does n't mean i do n't think about him because i do - it just becomes less excruciatingly painful . "
father jim kennedy is the priest at the blessed sacred church half a mile away in copenhagen street .
" at about 9pm i got the first call .
it was from south africa asking if somebody they knew was safe .
after that the calls started flooding in . "
by 1am , the church was held on standby by the emergency services as an overspill mortuary .
the church has built up a strong relationship with 30 of the 31 families who lost a loved one and says it act as the " spiritual home " for many of those affected .
survivor guilt occasionally , somebody affected by the fire drops by .
" a chap came in to see us , " said fr jim .
" he was quite distressed .
he used to go through king 's cross at 7.30pm each evening to go home .
" on that night he met a friend he had n't seen in about eight years .
they went out for a drink and he got home much later .
" he could n't get over the fact that he was not in the station at the time of the fire and was n't dead .
it took us a while to help him through that . "
a mass dedicated to the dead will be read at the church on sunday .
beyond that , there will be no fanfare .
" we wrote to all the families to ask if they wanted to do something for the anniversary but the overwhelming feeling is that they want to leave it where it is because in a sense everything has been done . "
