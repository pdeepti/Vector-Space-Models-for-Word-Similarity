" a simplified treaty is the only way forwards , " sarkozy told reporters at the joint press conference .
on his second foreign trip after his inauguration last week , the french leader said he was determined to make sure that agreement was reached at the eu summit next month .
he underlined that it was crucial that the eu break its current deadlock after french and dutch voters rejected the draft eu constitution in referenda in 2005 .
" i am convinced that europe can not remain at a standstill .
we can not remain in this relative paralysis , " said sarkozy .
" we have to find a way out of this impasse , " he added .
slimline treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy clearly wants to put france back at the heart of europe the french president would like to see the streamlined document including provision for a permanent eu presidency to replace the current rotating one , possibilities for " enhanced cooperation " between eu states and a move from unanimity to majority voting .
immigration issues should also be covered by the new treaty , he said .
a new eu rulebook is needed to ensure efficient and rapid decision-making in a bloc which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states over recent years .
the french president emphasised that the scaled-down treaty should be agreed by the member states ' parliaments rather than being put to the people .
during a debate about the constitutional crisis in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the concept of an " eu constitution " had put off many dutch voters who see the document as a threat to national sovereignty .
problematic symbol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is one of the dissenting voices in the debate " it is clear that the symbol of the constitution was an important reason for the no vote , " said balkenende .
he stressed the need for reform , but called for it to be achieved in small steps .
but some important european players reject the idea of scaling down the constitution .
italian prime minister romano prodi has attacked the idea of the french " mini-treaty " and threatened that a vanguard of european nations who want closer integration could go it alone .
germany , which currently holds the rotating six-month eu presidency , has also said repeatedly that it wants the " substance " of the constitution to be preserved and the charter of fundamental rights to be annexed to the new treaty .
chancellor angela merkel has made resurrecting the failed constitution a top priority .
at the eu summit in june she is expected to call on all governments to rally behind her proposals for a new " road map " for europe to be ratified before european parliament elections in summer 2009 . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant e.on drops bid for spanish utility ending a long battle , german energy giant e.on said monday it had abandoned its takeover bid for spanish power company endesa , but planned to buy assets from the group worth about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- .

" a simplified treaty is the only way forwards , " sarkozy told reporters at the joint press conference .
on his second foreign trip after his inauguration last week , the french leader said he was determined to make sure that agreement was reached at the eu summit next month .
he underlined that it was crucial that the eu break its current deadlock after french and dutch voters rejected the draft eu constitution in referenda in 2005 .
" i am convinced that europe can not remain at a standstill .
we can not remain in this relative paralysis , " said sarkozy .
" we have to find a way out of this impasse , " he added .
slimline treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy clearly wants to put france back at the heart of europe the french president would like to see the streamlined document including provision for a permanent eu presidency to replace the current rotating one , possibilities for " enhanced cooperation " between eu states and a move from unanimity to majority voting .
immigration issues should also be covered by the new treaty , he said .
a new eu rulebook is needed to ensure efficient and rapid decision-making in a bloc which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states over recent years .
the french president emphasised that the scaled-down treaty should be agreed by the member states ' parliaments rather than being put to the people .
during a debate about the constitutional crisis in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the concept of an " eu constitution " had put off many dutch voters who see the document as a threat to national sovereignty .
problematic symbol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is one of the dissenting voices in the debate " it is clear that the symbol of the constitution was an important reason for the no vote , " said balkenende .
he stressed the need for reform , but called for it to be achieved in small steps .
but some important european players reject the idea of scaling down the constitution .
italian prime minister romano prodi has attacked the idea of the french " mini-treaty " and threatened that a vanguard of european nations who want closer integration could go it alone .
germany , which currently holds the rotating six-month eu presidency , has also said repeatedly that it wants the " substance " of the constitution to be preserved and the charter of fundamental rights to be annexed to the new treaty .
chancellor angela merkel has made resurrecting the failed constitution a top priority .
at the eu summit in june she is expected to call on all governments to rally behind her proposals for a new " road map " for europe to be ratified before european parliament elections in summer 2009 . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant e.on drops bid for spanish utility ending a long battle , german energy giant e.on said monday it had abandoned its takeover bid for spanish power company endesa , but planned to buy assets from the group worth about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- .

the deal would give e.on access to an electricity market which is growing at an annual rate of five to six percent , the company said in a written statement .
" the upcoming liberalization of russia 's wholesale electricity sector will create an attractive business environment for investment in electricity generation , " it added .
ambitious plans e.on said that its long-term goal was to build up a strong position in the rapidly growing industrial regions in the urals , western siberia , volga , as well as in central russia .
the new joint venture , which will be based in tyumen in western siberia , is also aiming to reinforce its market presence in the region by participating in the privatization of russian state power company tgk-10 .
sts is involved in both power production and distribution and supplies some 1.1 million gas and electricity customers in western siberia .
it plans to transfer some of its own generating capacity into the new joint venture , e.on said .
the german company has not revealed how much money it will be investing in its project .
the news comes shortly after e.on 's plans to takeover spain 's endesa failed at the beginning of april .
sector privatization e.on has been keen to gain access to the russian electricity market for some time , but the sector has remained firmly in state hands .
russia 's state-owned holding compay rao ues is now taking steps to liberalize the electricity market to respond to the growing demand for power .
the industry , according to e.on , will require annual investments of some 15 billion euros over the next 15 years .
this is not merely a matter of modernizing power plants and grids , but also building new plants .
e.on said by increasing the efficiency of russian power plants it will also be able to help improve the environment . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic eon is moving in on the russian energy market feedback send us an e-mail .

the deal would give e.on access to an electricity market which is growing at an annual rate of five to six percent , the company said in a written statement .
" the upcoming liberalization of russia 's wholesale electricity sector will create an attractive business environment for investment in electricity generation , " it added .
ambitious plans e.on said that its long-term goal was to build up a strong position in the rapidly growing industrial regions in the urals , western siberia , volga , as well as in central russia .
the new joint venture , which will be based in tyumen in western siberia , is also aiming to reinforce its market presence in the region by participating in the privatization of russian state power company tgk-10 .
sts is involved in both power production and distribution and supplies some 1.1 million gas and electricity customers in western siberia .
it plans to transfer some of its own generating capacity into the new joint venture , e.on said .
the german company has not revealed how much money it will be investing in its project .
the news comes shortly after e.on 's plans to takeover spain 's endesa failed at the beginning of april .
sector privatization e.on has been keen to gain access to the russian electricity market for some time , but the sector has remained firmly in state hands .
russia 's state-owned holding compay rao ues is now taking steps to liberalize the electricity market to respond to the growing demand for power .
the industry , according to e.on , will require annual investments of some 15 billion euros over the next 15 years .

in an interview , the head of the stasi museum in leipzig explains why the issue is so emotive . tobias hollitzer is the head of the stasi " runde ecke " museum in the eastern german city of leipzig .
a row of sealed jars , each containing a seemingly innocuous yellow dust cloth , forms part of the museum 's permanent exhibition .
but these jars were part of the east german secret police 's collection of scent samples used to keep track of dissidents . hollitzer talked to dw-world.de about the stasi 's collection of people 's smells and what he thinks of law enforcement using the method today . dw-world.de : mr. hollitzer , the east german secret police , the stasi , collected scent samples .
why ? the stasi had a whole range of methods and means to try to track down people who said or did anything critical of the east german communist regime . collecting scent samples was used to try to identify those , for example , who had distributed flyers or who wrote critical graffiti . how did the stasi collect these samples ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained dogs are used to identify people 's smells when they found a piece of graffiti or a flyer then they took a dust cloth , which was usually yellow , and left it for a while lying next to the flyers covered by a protective piece of aluminum foil and then they had their sample .
the cloth was then sealed in a pickling jar and stored .
if the stasi later came across a suspect in the process of the investigation , they tried to get a sample from this person as well - of course , secretly .
a trained dog was given the two smells , and if they matched , the stasi had a concrete name . how did the stasi collected samples from people secretly ? they would often invite someone in for a talk with the police or other officials , for example , and undercover stasi officers pretending to be police officers or an administrative person were usually present at this meeting .
and while the person sat on the chair in the office , they would be , without knowing it , impregnating a yellow cloth hidden under the seat .
when this fictive visit was over , the stasi officer would then put the cloth in the pickle jar - and they had their sample . was scent sampling a method developed by the stasi ? no , it 's a well-known police method used in criminal investigations , but even in the gdr it was n't allowed to be admitted as evidence and that 's why the samples were often collected secretly instead of openly .
the problem is not with scent profiling as such , but rather with collecting scents as a precautionary measure in case they can eventually be used in the future .
this is what the stasi did - they had a giant scent register of dissidents .
they really tried to have a sample of everyone who potentially could have said something critical of the state how many samples are we talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi collected as much information as possible about people i 'm not sure of concrete numbers because in 1989 -lrb- when the berlin wall fell -rrb- the samples were destroyed and they are n't listed in the stasi files .
but just in the leipzig area , it would have certainly been several thousand . what do you think of current reports that german police have collected scent samples from activists who could be involved in violence in the lead-up to the g8 summit ? i think it is important to be very clear that the danger of the method is using it without having a concrete crime .
collecting samples on the suspicion that people could protest or offend in the future clearly harks back to stasi times , when security officials operated without any type of state limitation . in these times of the so-called war on terror , do you think the german state is going too far in its security activities ? the state has being going too far for a very long time - it 's just that now the issues surrounding the collection of scent samples are making this evident because here in germany , the stasi are so strongly associated with this particular method . if you take a look at what has happened here since sept 11. with new security laws , then we have to ask the question of how much freedom we want to sacrifice in the name of security .

in an interview , the head of the stasi museum in leipzig explains why the issue is so emotive . tobias hollitzer is the head of the stasi " runde ecke " museum in the eastern german city of leipzig .
a row of sealed jars , each containing a seemingly innocuous yellow dust cloth , forms part of the museum 's permanent exhibition .
but these jars were part of the east german secret police 's collection of scent samples used to keep track of dissidents . hollitzer talked to dw-world.de about the stasi 's collection of people 's smells and what he thinks of law enforcement using the method today . dw-world.de : mr. hollitzer , the east german secret police , the stasi , collected scent samples .
why ? the stasi had a whole range of methods and means to try to track down people who said or did anything critical of the east german communist regime . collecting scent samples was used to try to identify those , for example , who had distributed flyers or who wrote critical graffiti . how did the stasi collect these samples ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained dogs are used to identify people 's smells when they found a piece of graffiti or a flyer then they took a dust cloth , which was usually yellow , and left it for a while lying next to the flyers covered by a protective piece of aluminum foil and then they had their sample .
the cloth was then sealed in a pickling jar and stored .
if the stasi later came across a suspect in the process of the investigation , they tried to get a sample from this person as well - of course , secretly .
a trained dog was given the two smells , and if they matched , the stasi had a concrete name . how did the stasi collected samples from people secretly ? they would often invite someone in for a talk with the police or other officials , for example , and undercover stasi officers pretending to be police officers or an administrative person were usually present at this meeting .
and while the person sat on the chair in the office , they would be , without knowing it , impregnating a yellow cloth hidden under the seat .
when this fictive visit was over , the stasi officer would then put the cloth in the pickle jar - and they had their sample . was scent sampling a method developed by the stasi ? no , it 's a well-known police method used in criminal investigations , but even in the gdr it was n't allowed to be admitted as evidence and that 's why the samples were often collected secretly instead of openly .
the problem is not with scent profiling as such , but rather with collecting scents as a precautionary measure in case they can eventually be used in the future .
this is what the stasi did - they had a giant scent register of dissidents .
they really tried to have a sample of everyone who potentially could have said something critical of the state how many samples are we talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi collected as much information as possible about people i 'm not sure of concrete numbers because in 1989 -lrb- when the berlin wall fell -rrb- the samples were destroyed and they are n't listed in the stasi files .
but just in the leipzig area , it would have certainly been several thousand . what do you think of current reports that german police have collected scent samples from activists who could be involved in violence in the lead-up to the g8 summit ? i think it is important to be very clear that the danger of the method is using it without having a concrete crime .
collecting samples on the suspicion that people could protest or offend in the future clearly harks back to stasi times , when security officials operated without any type of state limitation . in these times of the so-called war on terror , do you think the german state is going too far in its security activities ? the state has being going too far for a very long time - it 's just that now the issues surrounding the collection of scent samples are making this evident because here in germany , the stasi are so strongly associated with this particular method . if you take a look at what has happened here since sept 11. with new security laws , then we have to ask the question of how much freedom we want to sacrifice in the name of security .

peter danckert : the additional confessions did n't come as a surprise to me .
for quite some time i 've been aware that doping is widespread , not only in germany but also in the international cycling scene .
i expect more to come in the next few days and months .
i also think that the confessions are not going to stop at the german border .
what are the biggest challenges in the fight against doping ?
we are dealing with widespread doping in cycling and other olympic sports that are less in the public eye at the moment .
we are working with deficient analysis systems and the testing labs are lagging behind and trying very painstakingly , despite a lack of financial resources , to track down what the economy and the pharmaceutical industry have put on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping is not limited to cyclists it 's becoming more and more apparent to me , when i make an appeal for amnesty-like regulations , that there are large groups within the organized sport scene that do n't even want this , for reasons that i do n't understand .
there is a considerable lack of information concerning the extent of doping , the structures , and the participation of doctors , managers , trainers and possibly even sponsors .
the very first goal must be to gather a picture of the situation that is as comprehensive as possible .
for me , sanctions are the second priority .
i ca n't expect active athletes to commit social or professional suicide by handing in a confession - and i ca n't offer them anything for it either .
they need a second chance and they can only get one if they have the opportunity to explain themselves openly without having to fear sanctions .
some sports organizations , such as the german olympic sport association -lrb- dosb -rrb- , have said that sanctions are more effective than legal penalties .
why are sanctions less important for you ?
there have to be effective legal measure in place , on the one hand .
we 'll have them when the law that is now on the table is passed in the beginning of july , because then the possession of moderate amounts of doping substances will be punishable by law , which gives the authorities a new and more effective approach .
on the other hand , we need understanding on the part of the sports organization .
they have to recognize that their entire sanction system has not been particularly effective .
they 've continually had cases where the doping test results were positive only by coincidence .
and since the tests are n't very effective , the fact that there are relatively few positive tests is n't proof that doping does n't happen but that the doping investigation methods are n't effective .
are you satisfied with the new anti-doping law that is set to be passed in germany in early july ?
to be honest , it does n't totally fulfil my expectations .
i would have wanted more extensive provisions .
but that 's politics .
when you have a coalition partner , you have to discuss with the partner and reach a solution .
as the old saying goes , " politics is the art of the doable . "
we have a law underway that i believe will offer additional investigation approaches in the future .
the federal bureau of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- will take responsibility , the range of punishment will become broader , telephone surveillance may become possible , and maybe a leniency program as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , it has been difficult to legally implicate doctors involved in doping cases if the sport scene does its part as well , then the chances are good that the situation will improve .
what can the sport scene do ?
and how can the sport scene and the government work together ?
it 's my hope that , after the statements from four professional cyclists and two doctors in the past few days , the sport world has recognized that these are not isolated cases but that mass doping is now the order of the day .
these are not isolated cases , even looking beyond germany 's borders .
i was in rome recently and spoke with recognized doping experts who said that it 's also widespread in italy , not only in cycling but in other olympic sports as well .
there are considerable deficits in many areas that can only be corrected with the help of the sport world .
for example , we have to convince the sponsors to contribute one percent of their sponsoring funds - which in germany alone amount to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - to the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- so that more can be done for prevention , training checks , competition checks and doping analysis .
that 's where the sport world can get involved - but they have to want to .
in many cases , it 's not just the athletes themselves who are involved in a doping case , but also trainers , managers and even doctors .
to what extent should these people also be subject to penalties ?
a lot has been achieved through the amendment to the pharmaceutical laws , which defines the legal penalties that deal with doping .
it used to be the case that only the sale of illegal substances was punishable .
now , when the law is passed in early july , the possession of moderate amounts of illegal substances will also be punishable .
for the police , the prosecutors and later for the courts , this is an additional and very effective way to fight doping .
it 's not only the athlete that is involved but also the trainers , the managers , the doctors and everyone surrounding the athlete that has been legally untouchable until now .
this will be different in the future and , with the federal bureau of criminal investigation , we have a very effective authority to take care of the job .

peter danckert : the additional confessions did n't come as a surprise to me .
for quite some time i 've been aware that doping is widespread , not only in germany but also in the international cycling scene .
i expect more to come in the next few days and months .
i also think that the confessions are not going to stop at the german border .
what are the biggest challenges in the fight against doping ?
we are dealing with widespread doping in cycling and other olympic sports that are less in the public eye at the moment .
we are working with deficient analysis systems and the testing labs are lagging behind and trying very painstakingly , despite a lack of financial resources , to track down what the economy and the pharmaceutical industry have put on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping is not limited to cyclists it 's becoming more and more apparent to me , when i make an appeal for amnesty-like regulations , that there are large groups within the organized sport scene that do n't even want this , for reasons that i do n't understand .
there is a considerable lack of information concerning the extent of doping , the structures , and the participation of doctors , managers , trainers and possibly even sponsors .
the very first goal must be to gather a picture of the situation that is as comprehensive as possible .
for me , sanctions are the second priority .
i ca n't expect active athletes to commit social or professional suicide by handing in a confession - and i ca n't offer them anything for it either .
they need a second chance and they can only get one if they have the opportunity to explain themselves openly without having to fear sanctions .
some sports organizations , such as the german olympic sport association -lrb- dosb -rrb- , have said that sanctions are more effective than legal penalties .
why are sanctions less important for you ?
there have to be effective legal measure in place , on the one hand .
we 'll have them when the law that is now on the table is passed in the beginning of july , because then the possession of moderate amounts of doping substances will be punishable by law , which gives the authorities a new and more effective approach .
on the other hand , we need understanding on the part of the sports organization .
they have to recognize that their entire sanction system has not been particularly effective .
they 've continually had cases where the doping test results were positive only by coincidence .
and since the tests are n't very effective , the fact that there are relatively few positive tests is n't proof that doping does n't happen but that the doping investigation methods are n't effective .
are you satisfied with the new anti-doping law that is set to be passed in germany in early july ?
to be honest , it does n't totally fulfil my expectations .
i would have wanted more extensive provisions .
but that 's politics .
when you have a coalition partner , you have to discuss with the partner and reach a solution .
as the old saying goes , " politics is the art of the doable . "
we have a law underway that i believe will offer additional investigation approaches in the future .
the federal bureau of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- will take responsibility , the range of punishment will become broader , telephone surveillance may become possible , and maybe a leniency program as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , it has been difficult to legally implicate doctors involved in doping cases if the sport scene does its part as well , then the chances are good that the situation will improve .
what can the sport scene do ?
and how can the sport scene and the government work together ?
it 's my hope that , after the statements from four professional cyclists and two doctors in the past few days , the sport world has recognized that these are not isolated cases but that mass doping is now the order of the day .
these are not isolated cases , even looking beyond germany 's borders .
i was in rome recently and spoke with recognized doping experts who said that it 's also widespread in italy , not only in cycling but in other olympic sports as well .
there are considerable deficits in many areas that can only be corrected with the help of the sport world .
for example , we have to convince the sponsors to contribute one percent of their sponsoring funds - which in germany alone amount to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - to the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- so that more can be done for prevention , training checks , competition checks and doping analysis .
that 's where the sport world can get involved - but they have to want to .
in many cases , it 's not just the athletes themselves who are involved in a doping case , but also trainers , managers and even doctors .
to what extent should these people also be subject to penalties ?
a lot has been achieved through the amendment to the pharmaceutical laws , which defines the legal penalties that deal with doping .
it used to be the case that only the sale of illegal substances was punishable .
now , when the law is passed in early july , the possession of moderate amounts of illegal substances will also be punishable .
for the police , the prosecutors and later for the courts , this is an additional and very effective way to fight doping .
it 's not only the athlete that is involved but also the trainers , the managers , the doctors and everyone surrounding the athlete that has been legally untouchable until now .
this will be different in the future and , with the federal bureau of criminal investigation , we have a very effective authority to take care of the job .

for example , we have to convince the sponsors to contribute one percent of their sponsoring funds - which in germany alone amount to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - to the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- so that more can be done for prevention , training checks , competition checks and doping analysis .
that 's where the sport world can get involved - but they have to want to .
in many cases , it 's not just the athletes themselves who are involved in a doping case , but also trainers , managers and even doctors .
to what extent should these people also be subject to penalties ?
a lot has been achieved through the amendment to the pharmaceutical laws , which defines the legal penalties that deal with doping .
it used to be the case that only the sale of illegal substances was punishable .
now , when the law is passed in early july , the possession of moderate amounts of illegal substances will also be punishable .
for the police , the prosecutors and later for the courts , this is an additional and very effective way to fight doping .
it 's not only the athlete that is involved but also the trainers , the managers , the doctors and everyone surrounding the athlete that has been legally untouchable until now .
this will be different in the future and , with the federal bureau of criminal investigation , we have a very effective authority to take care of the job .

in an interview , the head of the stasi museum in leipzig explains why the issue is so emotive . tobias hollitzer is the head of the stasi " runde ecke " museum in the eastern german city of leipzig .
a row of sealed jars , each containing a seemingly innocuous yellow dust cloth , forms part of the museum 's permanent exhibition .
but these jars were part of the east german secret police 's collection of scent samples used to keep track of dissidents . hollitzer talked to dw-world.de about the stasi 's collection of people 's smells and what he thinks of law enforcement using the method today . dw-world.de : mr. hollitzer , the east german secret police , the stasi , collected scent samples .
why ? the stasi had a whole range of methods and means to try to track down people who said or did anything critical of the east german communist regime . collecting scent samples was used to try to identify those , for example , who had distributed flyers or who wrote critical graffiti . how did the stasi collect these samples ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained dogs are used to identify people 's smells when they found a piece of graffiti or a flyer then they took a dust cloth , which was usually yellow , and left it for a while lying next to the flyers covered by a protective piece of aluminum foil and then they had their sample .
the cloth was then sealed in a pickling jar and stored .
if the stasi later came across a suspect in the process of the investigation , they tried to get a sample from this person as well - of course , secretly .
a trained dog was given the two smells , and if they matched , the stasi had a concrete name . how did the stasi collected samples from people secretly ? they would often invite someone in for a talk with the police or other officials , for example , and undercover stasi officers pretending to be police officers or an administrative person were usually present at this meeting .
and while the person sat on the chair in the office , they would be , without knowing it , impregnating a yellow cloth hidden under the seat .
when this fictive visit was over , the stasi officer would then put the cloth in the pickle jar - and they had their sample . was scent sampling a method developed by the stasi ? no , it 's a well-known police method used in criminal investigations , but even in the gdr it was n't allowed to be admitted as evidence and that 's why the samples were often collected secretly instead of openly .
the problem is not with scent profiling as such , but rather with collecting scents as a precautionary measure in case they can eventually be used in the future .
this is what the stasi did - they had a giant scent register of dissidents .
they really tried to have a sample of everyone who potentially could have said something critical of the state how many samples are we talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi collected as much information as possible about people i 'm not sure of concrete numbers because in 1989 -lrb- when the berlin wall fell -rrb- the samples were destroyed and they are n't listed in the stasi files .
but just in the leipzig area , it would have certainly been several thousand . what do you think of current reports that german police have collected scent samples from activists who could be involved in violence in the lead-up to the g8 summit ? i think it is important to be very clear that the danger of the method is using it without having a concrete crime .
collecting samples on the suspicion that people could protest or offend in the future clearly harks back to stasi times , when security officials operated without any type of state limitation . in these times of the so-called war on terror , do you think the german state is going too far in its security activities ? the state has being going too far for a very long time - it 's just that now the issues surrounding the collection of scent samples are making this evident because here in germany , the stasi are so strongly associated with this particular method . if you take a look at what has happened here since sept 11. with new security laws , then we have to ask the question of how much freedom we want to sacrifice in the name of security .
information such as telephone and internet data now has to be saved for at least six months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 24.05.2007 french proposal to end eu crisis makes headway großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a streamlined eu constitution might meet voter support french president nicolas sarkozy 's idea of a simplified treaty designed to end the european union 's constitional crisis appears to be gaining support . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said after talks with sarkozy in brussels on wednesday that a consensus was emerging among eu leaders in support of the plan to scale down the constitution .
" a simplified treaty is the only way forwards , " sarkozy told reporters at the joint press conference .
on his second foreign trip after his inauguration last week , the french leader said he was determined to make sure that agreement was reached at the eu summit next month .
he underlined that it was crucial that the eu break its current deadlock after french and dutch voters rejected the draft eu constitution in referenda in 2005 .
" i am convinced that europe can not remain at a standstill .
we can not remain in this relative paralysis , " said sarkozy .
" we have to find a way out of this impasse , " he added .
slimline treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy clearly wants to put france back at the heart of europe the french president would like to see the streamlined document including provision for a permanent eu presidency to replace the current rotating one , possibilities for " enhanced cooperation " between eu states and a move from unanimity to majority voting .
immigration issues should also be covered by the new treaty , he said .
a new eu rulebook is needed to ensure efficient and rapid decision-making in a bloc which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states over recent years .
the french president emphasised that the scaled-down treaty should be agreed by the member states ' parliaments rather than being put to the people .
during a debate about the constitutional crisis in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the concept of an " eu constitution " had put off many dutch voters who see the document as a threat to national sovereignty .
problematic symbol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is one of the dissenting voices in the debate " it is clear that the symbol of the constitution was an important reason for the no vote , " said balkenende .
he stressed the need for reform , but called for it to be achieved in small steps .
but some important european players reject the idea of scaling down the constitution .
italian prime minister romano prodi has attacked the idea of the french " mini-treaty " and threatened that a vanguard of european nations who want closer integration could go it alone .
germany , which currently holds the rotating six-month eu presidency , has also said repeatedly that it wants the " substance " of the constitution to be preserved and the charter of fundamental rights to be annexed to the new treaty .
chancellor angela merkel has made resurrecting the failed constitution a top priority .
at the eu summit in june she is expected to call on all governments to rally behind her proposals for a new " road map " for europe to be ratified before european parliament elections in summer 2009 . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant e.on drops bid for spanish utility ending a long battle , german energy giant e.on said monday it had abandoned its takeover bid for spanish power company endesa , but planned to buy assets from the group worth about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- .

" it is important that the g8 develops a common understand of how climate change can be tackled and what agreements can be made for the period beyond 2012 , " said merkel , referring to the year when the kyoto protocol expires .
merkel pessimistic about results the chancellor added , however , that she did n't expect concrete results to be achieved during the meeting of the group of eight industrialized countries on june 6-8 in the northern german city of heiligendamm .
" i can say quite openly that i do n't know if we will succeed in that at heiligendamm , " said merkel in her speech .
" but for me it is clear that the big developed nations must take the lead on this issue if we are to have a change at fighting climate change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 has to decide on kyoto 's successor environmental minister sigmar gabriel from the social democratic party said earlier this week in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf that said talks on climate change would be " super difficult " because of the position of the us .
" we have to put the pressure on , " he added .
germany wants code of conduct chancellor merkel on thursday also named hedge-fund transparency as a priority on the g8 agenda .
hedge-funds are an aggressive and risky investment tool estimated to incorporate some 1.5 trillion dollars world-wide .
transparency in the hedge-fund sector is " urgently necessary " to boost " confidence in the economy , " said the chancellor , adding that germany supports the development of an official code of conduct for the branch .
resistance to regulations in the hedge-fund sector has come from the us and britain , where most of the world 's 9,000 hedge-funds are located .
the chancellor acknowledged that steps had been made at the meeting of g8 finance ministers last weekend in potsdam , but , as with the climate change discussion , she also conceded that the negotiation process would need to be continued after the g8 summit .
focus on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono -lrb- left -rrb- and bob geldof have criticized the g8 development aid for africa would be another central discussion topic at the summit , said merkel , affirming that the g8 countries would honor the promises for development aid increases that they had made at their 2005 summit .
" we will keep these promises , " she said .
" the time has come to implement and our credibility is at stake . "
merkel announced that the increase in development aid could be financed with the fees the state exacts from companies for disposing of contaminating waste .
leaders from algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria , senegal and south africa have been invited to join the g8 member states as guests at the conference .
merkel defends police action in addition , merkel addressed g8 protesters .
protest must be peaceful , she said , " those who resort to violence make dialogue impossible . "
at the same time , the chancellor defended the security measures that have been implemented in germany in the run-up to the summit .

" a simplified treaty is the only way forwards , " sarkozy told reporters at the joint press conference .
on his second foreign trip after his inauguration last week , the french leader said he was determined to make sure that agreement was reached at the eu summit next month .
he underlined that it was crucial that the eu break its current deadlock after french and dutch voters rejected the draft eu constitution in referenda in 2005 .
" i am convinced that europe can not remain at a standstill .
we can not remain in this relative paralysis , " said sarkozy .
" we have to find a way out of this impasse , " he added .
slimline treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy clearly wants to put france back at the heart of europe the french president would like to see the streamlined document including provision for a permanent eu presidency to replace the current rotating one , possibilities for " enhanced cooperation " between eu states and a move from unanimity to majority voting .
immigration issues should also be covered by the new treaty , he said .
a new eu rulebook is needed to ensure efficient and rapid decision-making in a bloc which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states over recent years .
the french president emphasised that the scaled-down treaty should be agreed by the member states ' parliaments rather than being put to the people .
during a debate about the constitutional crisis in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the concept of an " eu constitution " had put off many dutch voters who see the document as a threat to national sovereignty .
problematic symbol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is one of the dissenting voices in the debate " it is clear that the symbol of the constitution was an important reason for the no vote , " said balkenende .
he stressed the need for reform , but called for it to be achieved in small steps .
but some important european players reject the idea of scaling down the constitution .
italian prime minister romano prodi has attacked the idea of the french " mini-treaty " and threatened that a vanguard of european nations who want closer integration could go it alone .
germany , which currently holds the rotating six-month eu presidency , has also said repeatedly that it wants the " substance " of the constitution to be preserved and the charter of fundamental rights to be annexed to the new treaty .
chancellor angela merkel has made resurrecting the failed constitution a top priority .
at the eu summit in june she is expected to call on all governments to rally behind her proposals for a new " road map " for europe to be ratified before european parliament elections in summer 2009 . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant e.on drops bid for spanish utility ending a long battle , german energy giant e.on said monday it had abandoned its takeover bid for spanish power company endesa , but planned to buy assets from the group worth about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- .

the french president emphasised that the scaled-down treaty should be agreed by the member states ' parliaments rather than being put to the people .
during a debate about the constitutional crisis in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the concept of an " eu constitution " had put off many dutch voters who see the document as a threat to national sovereignty .
problematic symbol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is one of the dissenting voices in the debate " it is clear that the symbol of the constitution was an important reason for the no vote , " said balkenende .
he stressed the need for reform , but called for it to be achieved in small steps .
but some important european players reject the idea of scaling down the constitution .
italian prime minister romano prodi has attacked the idea of the french " mini-treaty " and threatened that a vanguard of european nations who want closer integration could go it alone .
germany , which currently holds the rotating six-month eu presidency , has also said repeatedly that it wants the " substance " of the constitution to be preserved and the charter of fundamental rights to be annexed to the new treaty .
chancellor angela merkel has made resurrecting the failed constitution a top priority .
at the eu summit in june she is expected to call on all governments to rally behind her proposals for a new " road map " for europe to be ratified before european parliament elections in summer 2009 . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant e.on drops bid for spanish utility ending a long battle , german energy giant e.on said monday it had abandoned its takeover bid for spanish power company endesa , but planned to buy assets from the group worth about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- .

the deal would give e.on access to an electricity market which is growing at an annual rate of five to six percent , the company said in a written statement .
" the upcoming liberalization of russia 's wholesale electricity sector will create an attractive business environment for investment in electricity generation , " it added .
ambitious plans e.on said that its long-term goal was to build up a strong position in the rapidly growing industrial regions in the urals , western siberia , volga , as well as in central russia .
the new joint venture , which will be based in tyumen in western siberia , is also aiming to reinforce its market presence in the region by participating in the privatization of russian state power company tgk-10 .
sts is involved in both power production and distribution and supplies some 1.1 million gas and electricity customers in western siberia .
it plans to transfer some of its own generating capacity into the new joint venture , e.on said .
the german company has not revealed how much money it will be investing in its project .
the news comes shortly after e.on 's plans to takeover spain 's endesa failed at the beginning of april .
sector privatization e.on has been keen to gain access to the russian electricity market for some time , but the sector has remained firmly in state hands .
russia 's state-owned holding compay rao ues is now taking steps to liberalize the electricity market to respond to the growing demand for power .
the industry , according to e.on , will require annual investments of some 15 billion euros over the next 15 years .
this is not merely a matter of modernizing power plants and grids , but also building new plants .

the deal would give e.on access to an electricity market which is growing at an annual rate of five to six percent , the company said in a written statement .
" the upcoming liberalization of russia 's wholesale electricity sector will create an attractive business environment for investment in electricity generation , " it added .
ambitious plans e.on said that its long-term goal was to build up a strong position in the rapidly growing industrial regions in the urals , western siberia , volga , as well as in central russia .
the new joint venture , which will be based in tyumen in western siberia , is also aiming to reinforce its market presence in the region by participating in the privatization of russian state power company tgk-10 .
sts is involved in both power production and distribution and supplies some 1.1 million gas and electricity customers in western siberia .
it plans to transfer some of its own generating capacity into the new joint venture , e.on said .
the german company has not revealed how much money it will be investing in its project .
the news comes shortly after e.on 's plans to takeover spain 's endesa failed at the beginning of april .
sector privatization e.on has been keen to gain access to the russian electricity market for some time , but the sector has remained firmly in state hands .
russia 's state-owned holding compay rao ues is now taking steps to liberalize the electricity market to respond to the growing demand for power .
the industry , according to e.on , will require annual investments of some 15 billion euros over the next 15 years .
this is not merely a matter of modernizing power plants and grids , but also building new plants .
e.on said by increasing the efficiency of russian power plants it will also be able to help improve the environment . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic eon is moving in on the russian energy market feedback send us an e-mail .

it was a triumphant finale to a season which started with the club being docked eight points for their involvement in italy 's match-fixing scandal .
only a successful appeal against an initial , heavier , penalty enabled milan to enter the champions league at all , and they were forced to begin their campaign in the final qualifying round .
defying the odds " it is the greatest victory we have had , " ac milan coach carlo ancelotti said .
" few believed we could do it , but we have actually done something extraordinary that very few people , perhaps nobody , expected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool supporters dreams crushed in athens on wednesday .
liverpool 's chances of pulling a repeat of their 2005 victory over ancelotti 's men were dealt a severe blow by milan 's opening goal : an andrea pirlo free-kick that beat jose reina with the help of a deflection off inzaghi 's shoulder .
the striker had no hesitation in claiming the credit for the goal .
" of course we worked on that in training and sometimes it comes off , " he said , apparently tongue-in-cheek .
liverpool bruised , but gracious liverpool boss rafael benitez was enraged by the scarcity of extra time , but played down his touchline explosion afterwards .
" i do n't want to use this as an excuse , " the spaniard said .
" we were playing well until we conceded the first goal , and they have players with the quality to make the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final in athens : liverpool started out strong , but could n't match filippo inzaghi 's double strike .
" we were controlling the game , going forward and creating chances but we conceded a bad goal at a bad time , " benitez said .
line up changes failed with just under an hour gone , benitez introduced harry kewell .
but he proved no more effective than the man he replaced , bolo zenden .
the manager rejected suggestions he should have been bolder and started with the australian winger rather than packing five men across his midfield .
" kewell could not play a long time , he was ten months without playing , " benitez said . " milan are well organized in defence and good on counter attack .
when you try to attack , you have to keep a balance and not leave big spaces behind .
when you lose the balance against them they just need one opportunity and they will kill you . "
lucky opening goal ancelotti acknowledged that milan 's opening goal had been the lucky break his side needed against opponents who posed them far more problems than manchester united had in the semi-final .
" liverpool did not let us play the way we wanted in the first half , " ancelotti said .
" our midfielders were under pressure and we did not get the ball to kaka and clarence seedorf as much as we wanted . "
but he said this was a tough team and they had managed a difficult situation quite well . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milan face two opponents in liverpool and foolish revenge ac milan have waited two years to avenge the 2005 champions league final defeat to liverpool .

can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .
today our work is more complex and that makes it more difficult .
the suffering is not as striking and not as visible as it was then , but it 's nevertheless just as big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey is on his second mission in darfur chancellor angela merkel was critical this week at the africa summit and said that african states should guarantee that aid actually arrives where it 's needed .
what 's your opinion about this ?
the criticism is valid .
aid is often not given where it 's needed most but where it brings the most political gain .
doctors without borders is active where medical assistance is needed the most .
for this reason , we 're also present in the places where other organizations do n't go .
the darfur conflict will be discussed this week by the un human rights council and again in june at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
what are your expectations for these conferences ?
i 'm hopeful but i do n't have any big expectations .
aside from the meetings , it is my wish that the people wo n't have to live in camps any longer but can live at home and at peace with each other , and that they really have all the medical assistance that they need .
but that 's an optimistic wish .
it 's important that the people here are n't forgotten in the near future , which unfortunately happens often when a conflict drags on for years .
matthias hrubey is a general practitioner and the associate national coordinator for doctors without borders in darfur .

can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .

it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .

liverpool bruised , but gracious liverpool boss rafael benitez was enraged by the scarcity of extra time , but played down his touchline explosion afterwards .
" i do n't want to use this as an excuse , " the spaniard said .
" we were playing well until we conceded the first goal , and they have players with the quality to make the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final in athens : liverpool started out strong , but could n't match filippo inzaghi 's double strike .
" we were controlling the game , going forward and creating chances but we conceded a bad goal at a bad time , " benitez said .
line up changes failed with just under an hour gone , benitez introduced harry kewell .
but he proved no more effective than the man he replaced , bolo zenden .
the manager rejected suggestions he should have been bolder and started with the australian winger rather than packing five men across his midfield .
" kewell could not play a long time , he was ten months without playing , " benitez said . " milan are well organized in defence and good on counter attack .
when you try to attack , you have to keep a balance and not leave big spaces behind .
when you lose the balance against them they just need one opportunity and they will kill you . "
lucky opening goal ancelotti acknowledged that milan 's opening goal had been the lucky break his side needed against opponents who posed them far more problems than manchester united had in the semi-final .
" liverpool did not let us play the way we wanted in the first half , " ancelotti said .
" our midfielders were under pressure and we did not get the ball to kaka and clarence seedorf as much as we wanted . "
but he said this was a tough team and they had managed a difficult situation quite well . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milan face two opponents in liverpool and foolish revenge ac milan have waited two years to avenge the 2005 champions league final defeat to liverpool .

can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .
today our work is more complex and that makes it more difficult .
the suffering is not as striking and not as visible as it was then , but it 's nevertheless just as big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey is on his second mission in darfur chancellor angela merkel was critical this week at the africa summit and said that african states should guarantee that aid actually arrives where it 's needed .
what 's your opinion about this ?
the criticism is valid .
aid is often not given where it 's needed most but where it brings the most political gain .
doctors without borders is active where medical assistance is needed the most .
for this reason , we 're also present in the places where other organizations do n't go .
the darfur conflict will be discussed this week by the un human rights council and again in june at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
what are your expectations for these conferences ?
i 'm hopeful but i do n't have any big expectations .
aside from the meetings , it is my wish that the people wo n't have to live in camps any longer but can live at home and at peace with each other , and that they really have all the medical assistance that they need .
but that 's an optimistic wish .
it 's important that the people here are n't forgotten in the near future , which unfortunately happens often when a conflict drags on for years .
matthias hrubey is a general practitioner and the associate national coordinator for doctors without borders in darfur .
along with 100 international and more than 2,000 local colleagues , he provides medical attention to those who need it .

can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .
today our work is more complex and that makes it more difficult .
the suffering is not as striking and not as visible as it was then , but it 's nevertheless just as big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey is on his second mission in darfur chancellor angela merkel was critical this week at the africa summit and said that african states should guarantee that aid actually arrives where it 's needed .
what 's your opinion about this ?
the criticism is valid .
aid is often not given where it 's needed most but where it brings the most political gain .
doctors without borders is active where medical assistance is needed the most .
for this reason , we 're also present in the places where other organizations do n't go .
the darfur conflict will be discussed this week by the un human rights council and again in june at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
what are your expectations for these conferences ?
i 'm hopeful but i do n't have any big expectations .
aside from the meetings , it is my wish that the people wo n't have to live in camps any longer but can live at home and at peace with each other , and that they really have all the medical assistance that they need .
but that 's an optimistic wish .
it 's important that the people here are n't forgotten in the near future , which unfortunately happens often when a conflict drags on for years .
matthias hrubey is a general practitioner and the associate national coordinator for doctors without borders in darfur .
along with 100 international and more than 2,000 local colleagues , he provides medical attention to those who need it .

it was a triumphant finale to a season which started with the club being docked eight points for their involvement in italy 's match-fixing scandal .
only a successful appeal against an initial , heavier , penalty enabled milan to enter the champions league at all , and they were forced to begin their campaign in the final qualifying round .
defying the odds " it is the greatest victory we have had , " ac milan coach carlo ancelotti said .
" few believed we could do it , but we have actually done something extraordinary that very few people , perhaps nobody , expected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool supporters dreams crushed in athens on wednesday .
liverpool 's chances of pulling a repeat of their 2005 victory over ancelotti 's men were dealt a severe blow by milan 's opening goal : an andrea pirlo free-kick that beat jose reina with the help of a deflection off inzaghi 's shoulder .
the striker had no hesitation in claiming the credit for the goal .
" of course we worked on that in training and sometimes it comes off , " he said , apparently tongue-in-cheek .
liverpool bruised , but gracious liverpool boss rafael benitez was enraged by the scarcity of extra time , but played down his touchline explosion afterwards .
" i do n't want to use this as an excuse , " the spaniard said .
" we were playing well until we conceded the first goal , and they have players with the quality to make the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final in athens : liverpool started out strong , but could n't match filippo inzaghi 's double strike .
" we were controlling the game , going forward and creating chances but we conceded a bad goal at a bad time , " benitez said .
line up changes failed with just under an hour gone , benitez introduced harry kewell .
but he proved no more effective than the man he replaced , bolo zenden .
the manager rejected suggestions he should have been bolder and started with the australian winger rather than packing five men across his midfield .
" kewell could not play a long time , he was ten months without playing , " benitez said . " milan are well organized in defence and good on counter attack .
when you try to attack , you have to keep a balance and not leave big spaces behind .
when you lose the balance against them they just need one opportunity and they will kill you . "
lucky opening goal ancelotti acknowledged that milan 's opening goal had been the lucky break his side needed against opponents who posed them far more problems than manchester united had in the semi-final .
" liverpool did not let us play the way we wanted in the first half , " ancelotti said .
" our midfielders were under pressure and we did not get the ball to kaka and clarence seedorf as much as we wanted . "
but he said this was a tough team and they had managed a difficult situation quite well . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milan face two opponents in liverpool and foolish revenge ac milan have waited two years to avenge the 2005 champions league final defeat to liverpool .

" the presidency urgently appeals to iran to reconsider its policy and to comply with the demands of the international community , " the eu presidency said in statement . it said the european union has taken note of the latest report of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on iran with " great concern . " in the report , iaea director mohamed elbaradei accused iran of failing to cooperate with his agency 's inspectors and said that he agreed with us assessments that iran could acquire nuclear weapons within the next decade . " in other words three to eight years from now , " he said . the eu said the report confirmed that iran has flouted two recent un resolutions demanding that the islamic republic suspend uranium enrichment , which is at the heart of its standoff with the west . " iran has disregarded these appeals and continued to drive forward its nuclear program as well as restricting its cooperation with the iaea . " eu urges tehran to prove " peaceful " program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's ferrero-waldner , steinmeier and solana the eu presidency called on tehran to cooperate with iaea inspectors in order to convince the world of its claims that its nuclear program is of " an exclusively peaceful nature . " it said iran should use talks between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator on may 31 to signal a change in policy that will allow full negotiations to resolve the nuclear standoff to resume . iran 's hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad reacted defiantly to the report and to threats of fresh sanctions from the west , saying iran would not retreat " a single step " on its nuclear program . meanwhile , france and the united states warned that the un security council would have to discuss a third package of sanctions measures against iran unless it made a major about-turn by freezing sensitive nuclear work . but president mahmoud ahmadinejad indicated the islamic republic was in no mood to cave into the demands of the west . " the enemies aim to prevent us from using peaceful nuclear technology , not for scientific reasons but because they want to eradicate the roots of the principles of the islamic republic , " he said on thursday , according to the isna news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- r -rrb- is known for his fiery anti-western speeches " therefore if we stop , even for a moment , they will achieve their aims , " he told a group of elite revolutionary guards commanders . ahmadinejad made the comments a day after the international atomic energy agency said that iran was making substantial advances in uranium enrichment in defiance of world demands to stop . new sanctions threat the iaea board will review its assessement in june , paving the way for a security council meeting on iran that could agree new sanctions in addition to existing measures against iran 's nuclear and ballistics industries . new french foreign minister bernard kouchner said paris backed the rapid adoption of " new sanctions " against iran if it maintains its refusal . " if that is the case , i hope that we can rapidly adopt new sanctions that will show iran that the path it has chosen is unacceptable and will only drive it into growing isolation , " said kouchner , who was on a visit to lebanon . us warning the united states said that unless iran agreed to a longstanding offer to suspend sensitive nuclear work as a prelude to negotiations , there was no other option than a drive for further sanctions . " iran is once again thumbing its nose at the international community , " us under secretary of state nicholas burns said after the iaea report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran inaugurated two minor plants at its bushehr nuclear reactor in april " should it turn down the offer again , i would think what you 'd see is a strong drive " by the us security council for a third sanctions resolution . at issue is iran 's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment , a process that can be used both to make nuclear fuel and highly enriched uranium for the explosive core of an atomic bomb . the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons but the islamic republic insists it just wants to generate energy for a growing population . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran expects " new ideas " from eu to end nuclear standoff iran 's nuclear negotiator ali larijani said wednesday that he expected new ideas from eu foreign policy chief javier solana on breaking the standoff over tehran 's disputed nuclear program .

the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .
today our work is more complex and that makes it more difficult .
the suffering is not as striking and not as visible as it was then , but it 's nevertheless just as big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey is on his second mission in darfur chancellor angela merkel was critical this week at the africa summit and said that african states should guarantee that aid actually arrives where it 's needed .
what 's your opinion about this ?
the criticism is valid .
aid is often not given where it 's needed most but where it brings the most political gain .
doctors without borders is active where medical assistance is needed the most .
for this reason , we 're also present in the places where other organizations do n't go .
the darfur conflict will be discussed this week by the un human rights council and again in june at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
what are your expectations for these conferences ?
i 'm hopeful but i do n't have any big expectations .
aside from the meetings , it is my wish that the people wo n't have to live in camps any longer but can live at home and at peace with each other , and that they really have all the medical assistance that they need .
but that 's an optimistic wish .
it 's important that the people here are n't forgotten in the near future , which unfortunately happens often when a conflict drags on for years .
matthias hrubey is a general practitioner and the associate national coordinator for doctors without borders in darfur .
along with 100 international and more than 2,000 local colleagues , he provides medical attention to those who need it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 24.05.2007 " the people of darfur ca n't be forgotten " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ongoing conflict in darfur has led to hundreds of thousands of refugees matthias hrubey , a german physician who works with doctors without borders in darfur , spoke with dw-world.de about the challenges the ngo is facing in the north african crisis region . dw-world.de : the crisis in darfur is talked about in many political circles .
can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .
today our work is more complex and that makes it more difficult .
the suffering is not as striking and not as visible as it was then , but it 's nevertheless just as big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey is on his second mission in darfur chancellor angela merkel was critical this week at the africa summit and said that african states should guarantee that aid actually arrives where it 's needed .
what 's your opinion about this ?
the criticism is valid .
aid is often not given where it 's needed most but where it brings the most political gain .
doctors without borders is active where medical assistance is needed the most .
for this reason , we 're also present in the places where other organizations do n't go .
the darfur conflict will be discussed this week by the un human rights council and again in june at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
what are your expectations for these conferences ?
i 'm hopeful but i do n't have any big expectations .
aside from the meetings , it is my wish that the people wo n't have to live in camps any longer but can live at home and at peace with each other , and that they really have all the medical assistance that they need .
but that 's an optimistic wish .
it 's important that the people here are n't forgotten in the near future , which unfortunately happens often when a conflict drags on for years .
matthias hrubey is a general practitioner and the associate national coordinator for doctors without borders in darfur .
along with 100 international and more than 2,000 local colleagues , he provides medical attention to those who need it .

the government said it wanted to continue accompanying the peace process in the region and help contain one of the greatest humanitarian catastrophes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 24.05.2007 " mass doping is now the order of the day " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new anti-doping law will make investigators more effective , said peter danckert peter danckert , chairman of the parliamentary committee on sports , spoke with dw-world.de about the recent slough of doping confessions , germany 's new anti-doping law and what the sport world can do better . dw-world.de : mr. danckert , what is your reaction to the most recent doping confessions from telekom cyclists ?
peter danckert : the additional confessions did n't come as a surprise to me .
for quite some time i 've been aware that doping is widespread , not only in germany but also in the international cycling scene .
i expect more to come in the next few days and months .
i also think that the confessions are not going to stop at the german border .
what are the biggest challenges in the fight against doping ?
we are dealing with widespread doping in cycling and other olympic sports that are less in the public eye at the moment .
we are working with deficient analysis systems and the testing labs are lagging behind and trying very painstakingly , despite a lack of financial resources , to track down what the economy and the pharmaceutical industry have put on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping is not limited to cyclists it 's becoming more and more apparent to me , when i make an appeal for amnesty-like regulations , that there are large groups within the organized sport scene that do n't even want this , for reasons that i do n't understand .
there is a considerable lack of information concerning the extent of doping , the structures , and the participation of doctors , managers , trainers and possibly even sponsors .
the very first goal must be to gather a picture of the situation that is as comprehensive as possible .
for me , sanctions are the second priority .
i ca n't expect active athletes to commit social or professional suicide by handing in a confession - and i ca n't offer them anything for it either .
they need a second chance and they can only get one if they have the opportunity to explain themselves openly without having to fear sanctions .
some sports organizations , such as the german olympic sport association -lrb- dosb -rrb- , have said that sanctions are more effective than legal penalties .
why are sanctions less important for you ?
there have to be effective legal measure in place , on the one hand .
we 'll have them when the law that is now on the table is passed in the beginning of july , because then the possession of moderate amounts of doping substances will be punishable by law , which gives the authorities a new and more effective approach .
on the other hand , we need understanding on the part of the sports organization .
they have to recognize that their entire sanction system has not been particularly effective .
they 've continually had cases where the doping test results were positive only by coincidence .
and since the tests are n't very effective , the fact that there are relatively few positive tests is n't proof that doping does n't happen but that the doping investigation methods are n't effective .
are you satisfied with the new anti-doping law that is set to be passed in germany in early july ?
to be honest , it does n't totally fulfil my expectations .
i would have wanted more extensive provisions .
but that 's politics .
when you have a coalition partner , you have to discuss with the partner and reach a solution .
as the old saying goes , " politics is the art of the doable . "

what can the sport scene do ?
and how can the sport scene and the government work together ?
it 's my hope that , after the statements from four professional cyclists and two doctors in the past few days , the sport world has recognized that these are not isolated cases but that mass doping is now the order of the day .
these are not isolated cases , even looking beyond germany 's borders .
i was in rome recently and spoke with recognized doping experts who said that it 's also widespread in italy , not only in cycling but in other olympic sports as well .
there are considerable deficits in many areas that can only be corrected with the help of the sport world .
for example , we have to convince the sponsors to contribute one percent of their sponsoring funds - which in germany alone amount to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - to the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- so that more can be done for prevention , training checks , competition checks and doping analysis .
that 's where the sport world can get involved - but they have to want to .
in many cases , it 's not just the athletes themselves who are involved in a doping case , but also trainers , managers and even doctors .
to what extent should these people also be subject to penalties ?
a lot has been achieved through the amendment to the pharmaceutical laws , which defines the legal penalties that deal with doping .
it used to be the case that only the sale of illegal substances was punishable .
now , when the law is passed in early july , the possession of moderate amounts of illegal substances will also be punishable .
for the police , the prosecutors and later for the courts , this is an additional and very effective way to fight doping .
it 's not only the athlete that is involved but also the trainers , the managers , the doctors and everyone surrounding the athlete that has been legally untouchable until now .

peter danckert : the additional confessions did n't come as a surprise to me .
for quite some time i 've been aware that doping is widespread , not only in germany but also in the international cycling scene .
i expect more to come in the next few days and months .
i also think that the confessions are not going to stop at the german border .
what are the biggest challenges in the fight against doping ?
we are dealing with widespread doping in cycling and other olympic sports that are less in the public eye at the moment .
we are working with deficient analysis systems and the testing labs are lagging behind and trying very painstakingly , despite a lack of financial resources , to track down what the economy and the pharmaceutical industry have put on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping is not limited to cyclists it 's becoming more and more apparent to me , when i make an appeal for amnesty-like regulations , that there are large groups within the organized sport scene that do n't even want this , for reasons that i do n't understand .
there is a considerable lack of information concerning the extent of doping , the structures , and the participation of doctors , managers , trainers and possibly even sponsors .
the very first goal must be to gather a picture of the situation that is as comprehensive as possible .
for me , sanctions are the second priority .
i ca n't expect active athletes to commit social or professional suicide by handing in a confession - and i ca n't offer them anything for it either .
they need a second chance and they can only get one if they have the opportunity to explain themselves openly without having to fear sanctions .
some sports organizations , such as the german olympic sport association -lrb- dosb -rrb- , have said that sanctions are more effective than legal penalties .
why are sanctions less important for you ?
there have to be effective legal measure in place , on the one hand .
we 'll have them when the law that is now on the table is passed in the beginning of july , because then the possession of moderate amounts of doping substances will be punishable by law , which gives the authorities a new and more effective approach .
on the other hand , we need understanding on the part of the sports organization .
they have to recognize that their entire sanction system has not been particularly effective .
they 've continually had cases where the doping test results were positive only by coincidence .
and since the tests are n't very effective , the fact that there are relatively few positive tests is n't proof that doping does n't happen but that the doping investigation methods are n't effective .
are you satisfied with the new anti-doping law that is set to be passed in germany in early july ?
to be honest , it does n't totally fulfil my expectations .
i would have wanted more extensive provisions .
but that 's politics .
when you have a coalition partner , you have to discuss with the partner and reach a solution .
as the old saying goes , " politics is the art of the doable . "
we have a law underway that i believe will offer additional investigation approaches in the future .
the federal bureau of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- will take responsibility , the range of punishment will become broader , telephone surveillance may become possible , and maybe a leniency program as well .

peter danckert : the additional confessions did n't come as a surprise to me .
for quite some time i 've been aware that doping is widespread , not only in germany but also in the international cycling scene .
i expect more to come in the next few days and months .
i also think that the confessions are not going to stop at the german border .
what are the biggest challenges in the fight against doping ?
we are dealing with widespread doping in cycling and other olympic sports that are less in the public eye at the moment .
we are working with deficient analysis systems and the testing labs are lagging behind and trying very painstakingly , despite a lack of financial resources , to track down what the economy and the pharmaceutical industry have put on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping is not limited to cyclists it 's becoming more and more apparent to me , when i make an appeal for amnesty-like regulations , that there are large groups within the organized sport scene that do n't even want this , for reasons that i do n't understand .
there is a considerable lack of information concerning the extent of doping , the structures , and the participation of doctors , managers , trainers and possibly even sponsors .
the very first goal must be to gather a picture of the situation that is as comprehensive as possible .
for me , sanctions are the second priority .
i ca n't expect active athletes to commit social or professional suicide by handing in a confession - and i ca n't offer them anything for it either .
they need a second chance and they can only get one if they have the opportunity to explain themselves openly without having to fear sanctions .
some sports organizations , such as the german olympic sport association -lrb- dosb -rrb- , have said that sanctions are more effective than legal penalties .
why are sanctions less important for you ?
there have to be effective legal measure in place , on the one hand .
we 'll have them when the law that is now on the table is passed in the beginning of july , because then the possession of moderate amounts of doping substances will be punishable by law , which gives the authorities a new and more effective approach .
on the other hand , we need understanding on the part of the sports organization .
they have to recognize that their entire sanction system has not been particularly effective .
they 've continually had cases where the doping test results were positive only by coincidence .
and since the tests are n't very effective , the fact that there are relatively few positive tests is n't proof that doping does n't happen but that the doping investigation methods are n't effective .
are you satisfied with the new anti-doping law that is set to be passed in germany in early july ?
to be honest , it does n't totally fulfil my expectations .
i would have wanted more extensive provisions .
but that 's politics .
when you have a coalition partner , you have to discuss with the partner and reach a solution .
as the old saying goes , " politics is the art of the doable . "
we have a law underway that i believe will offer additional investigation approaches in the future .
the federal bureau of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- will take responsibility , the range of punishment will become broader , telephone surveillance may become possible , and maybe a leniency program as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , it has been difficult to legally implicate doctors involved in doping cases if the sport scene does its part as well , then the chances are good that the situation will improve .
what can the sport scene do ?
and how can the sport scene and the government work together ?
it 's my hope that , after the statements from four professional cyclists and two doctors in the past few days , the sport world has recognized that these are not isolated cases but that mass doping is now the order of the day .
these are not isolated cases , even looking beyond germany 's borders .
i was in rome recently and spoke with recognized doping experts who said that it 's also widespread in italy , not only in cycling but in other olympic sports as well .
there are considerable deficits in many areas that can only be corrected with the help of the sport world .
for example , we have to convince the sponsors to contribute one percent of their sponsoring funds - which in germany alone amount to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - to the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- so that more can be done for prevention , training checks , competition checks and doping analysis .
that 's where the sport world can get involved - but they have to want to .
in many cases , it 's not just the athletes themselves who are involved in a doping case , but also trainers , managers and even doctors .
to what extent should these people also be subject to penalties ?
a lot has been achieved through the amendment to the pharmaceutical laws , which defines the legal penalties that deal with doping .
it used to be the case that only the sale of illegal substances was punishable .
now , when the law is passed in early july , the possession of moderate amounts of illegal substances will also be punishable .
for the police , the prosecutors and later for the courts , this is an additional and very effective way to fight doping .
it 's not only the athlete that is involved but also the trainers , the managers , the doctors and everyone surrounding the athlete that has been legally untouchable until now .
this will be different in the future and , with the federal bureau of criminal investigation , we have a very effective authority to take care of the job .

" a simplified treaty is the only way forwards , " sarkozy told reporters at the joint press conference .
on his second foreign trip after his inauguration last week , the french leader said he was determined to make sure that agreement was reached at the eu summit next month .
he underlined that it was crucial that the eu break its current deadlock after french and dutch voters rejected the draft eu constitution in referenda in 2005 .
" i am convinced that europe can not remain at a standstill .
we can not remain in this relative paralysis , " said sarkozy .
" we have to find a way out of this impasse , " he added .
slimline treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy clearly wants to put france back at the heart of europe the french president would like to see the streamlined document including provision for a permanent eu presidency to replace the current rotating one , possibilities for " enhanced cooperation " between eu states and a move from unanimity to majority voting .
immigration issues should also be covered by the new treaty , he said .
a new eu rulebook is needed to ensure efficient and rapid decision-making in a bloc which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states over recent years .
the french president emphasised that the scaled-down treaty should be agreed by the member states ' parliaments rather than being put to the people .
during a debate about the constitutional crisis in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the concept of an " eu constitution " had put off many dutch voters who see the document as a threat to national sovereignty .
problematic symbol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is one of the dissenting voices in the debate " it is clear that the symbol of the constitution was an important reason for the no vote , " said balkenende .
he stressed the need for reform , but called for it to be achieved in small steps .
but some important european players reject the idea of scaling down the constitution .
italian prime minister romano prodi has attacked the idea of the french " mini-treaty " and threatened that a vanguard of european nations who want closer integration could go it alone .
germany , which currently holds the rotating six-month eu presidency , has also said repeatedly that it wants the " substance " of the constitution to be preserved and the charter of fundamental rights to be annexed to the new treaty .
chancellor angela merkel has made resurrecting the failed constitution a top priority .
at the eu summit in june she is expected to call on all governments to rally behind her proposals for a new " road map " for europe to be ratified before european parliament elections in summer 2009 . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant e.on drops bid for spanish utility ending a long battle , german energy giant e.on said monday it had abandoned its takeover bid for spanish power company endesa , but planned to buy assets from the group worth about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- .

it was a triumphant finale to a season which started with the club being docked eight points for their involvement in italy 's match-fixing scandal .
only a successful appeal against an initial , heavier , penalty enabled milan to enter the champions league at all , and they were forced to begin their campaign in the final qualifying round .

liverpool 's chances of pulling a repeat of their 2005 victory over ancelotti 's men were dealt a severe blow by milan 's opening goal : an andrea pirlo free-kick that beat jose reina with the help of a deflection off inzaghi 's shoulder .
the striker had no hesitation in claiming the credit for the goal .
" of course we worked on that in training and sometimes it comes off , " he said , apparently tongue-in-cheek .
liverpool bruised , but gracious liverpool boss rafael benitez was enraged by the scarcity of extra time , but played down his touchline explosion afterwards .

line up changes failed with just under an hour gone , benitez introduced harry kewell .
but he proved no more effective than the man he replaced , bolo zenden .
the manager rejected suggestions he should have been bolder and started with the australian winger rather than packing five men across his midfield .

" liverpool did not let us play the way we wanted in the first half , " ancelotti said .

it was a triumphant finale to a season which started with the club being docked eight points for their involvement in italy 's match-fixing scandal .
only a successful appeal against an initial , heavier , penalty enabled milan to enter the champions league at all , and they were forced to begin their campaign in the final qualifying round .

" few believed we could do it , but we have actually done something extraordinary that very few people , perhaps nobody , expected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool supporters dreams crushed in athens on wednesday .
liverpool 's chances of pulling a repeat of their 2005 victory over ancelotti 's men were dealt a severe blow by milan 's opening goal : an andrea pirlo free-kick that beat jose reina with the help of a deflection off inzaghi 's shoulder .
the striker had no hesitation in claiming the credit for the goal .
" of course we worked on that in training and sometimes it comes off , " he said , apparently tongue-in-cheek .
liverpool bruised , but gracious liverpool boss rafael benitez was enraged by the scarcity of extra time , but played down his touchline explosion afterwards .

line up changes failed with just under an hour gone , benitez introduced harry kewell .
but he proved no more effective than the man he replaced , bolo zenden .
the manager rejected suggestions he should have been bolder and started with the australian winger rather than packing five men across his midfield .
" kewell could not play a long time , he was ten months without playing , " benitez said . " milan are well organized in defence and good on counter attack .
when you try to attack , you have to keep a balance and not leave big spaces behind .
when you lose the balance against them they just need one opportunity and they will kill you . "

" liverpool did not let us play the way we wanted in the first half , " ancelotti said .

" it is important that the g8 develops a common understand of how climate change can be tackled and what agreements can be made for the period beyond 2012 , " said merkel , referring to the year when the kyoto protocol expires .
merkel pessimistic about results the chancellor added , however , that she did n't expect concrete results to be achieved during the meeting of the group of eight industrialized countries on june 6-8 in the northern german city of heiligendamm .
" i can say quite openly that i do n't know if we will succeed in that at heiligendamm , " said merkel in her speech .
" but for me it is clear that the big developed nations must take the lead on this issue if we are to have a change at fighting climate change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 has to decide on kyoto 's successor environmental minister sigmar gabriel from the social democratic party said earlier this week in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf that said talks on climate change would be " super difficult " because of the position of the us .
" we have to put the pressure on , " he added .
germany wants code of conduct chancellor merkel on thursday also named hedge-fund transparency as a priority on the g8 agenda .
hedge-funds are an aggressive and risky investment tool estimated to incorporate some 1.5 trillion dollars world-wide .
transparency in the hedge-fund sector is " urgently necessary " to boost " confidence in the economy , " said the chancellor , adding that germany supports the development of an official code of conduct for the branch .
resistance to regulations in the hedge-fund sector has come from the us and britain , where most of the world 's 9,000 hedge-funds are located .
the chancellor acknowledged that steps had been made at the meeting of g8 finance ministers last weekend in potsdam , but , as with the climate change discussion , she also conceded that the negotiation process would need to be continued after the g8 summit .
focus on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono -lrb- left -rrb- and bob geldof have criticized the g8 development aid for africa would be another central discussion topic at the summit , said merkel , affirming that the g8 countries would honor the promises for development aid increases that they had made at their 2005 summit .
" we will keep these promises , " she said .
" the time has come to implement and our credibility is at stake . "
merkel announced that the increase in development aid could be financed with the fees the state exacts from companies for disposing of contaminating waste .
leaders from algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria , senegal and south africa have been invited to join the g8 member states as guests at the conference .
merkel defends police action in addition , merkel addressed g8 protesters .
protest must be peaceful , she said , " those who resort to violence make dialogue impossible . "
at the same time , the chancellor defended the security measures that have been implemented in germany in the run-up to the summit .
police have recently come under fire for raiding the offices of left-wing groups and taking body scent samples to be used in the event of a crime .
numerous parliamentarians have spoken out against the scent samples , making a comparison to the practices of the secret police in former east germany . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rich g8 countries need to fulfill promises professor jeffrey sachs , director of the earth institute at columbia university and special advisor to un secretary-general ban ki-moon outlines what action the g8 must take to end poverty and retain credibility .

" it is important that the g8 develops a common understand of how climate change can be tackled and what agreements can be made for the period beyond 2012 , " said merkel , referring to the year when the kyoto protocol expires .
merkel pessimistic about results the chancellor added , however , that she did n't expect concrete results to be achieved during the meeting of the group of eight industrialized countries on june 6-8 in the northern german city of heiligendamm .
" i can say quite openly that i do n't know if we will succeed in that at heiligendamm , " said merkel in her speech .

germany wants code of conduct chancellor merkel on thursday also named hedge-fund transparency as a priority on the g8 agenda .

transparency in the hedge-fund sector is " urgently necessary " to boost " confidence in the economy , " said the chancellor , adding that germany supports the development of an official code of conduct for the branch .
resistance to regulations in the hedge-fund sector has come from the us and britain , where most of the world 's 9,000 hedge-funds are located .

" we will keep these promises , " she said .
" the time has come to implement and our credibility is at stake . "
merkel announced that the increase in development aid could be financed with the fees the state exacts from companies for disposing of contaminating waste .
leaders from algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria , senegal and south africa have been invited to join the g8 member states as guests at the conference .
merkel defends police action in addition , merkel addressed g8 protesters .
protest must be peaceful , she said , " those who resort to violence make dialogue impossible . "

resistance to regulations in the hedge-fund sector has come from the us and britain , where most of the world 's 9,000 hedge-funds are located .
the chancellor acknowledged that steps had been made at the meeting of g8 finance ministers last weekend in potsdam , but , as with the climate change discussion , she also conceded that the negotiation process would need to be continued after the g8 summit .

" we will keep these promises , " she said .
" the time has come to implement and our credibility is at stake . "
merkel announced that the increase in development aid could be financed with the fees the state exacts from companies for disposing of contaminating waste .

merkel defends police action in addition , merkel addressed g8 protesters .
protest must be peaceful , she said , " those who resort to violence make dialogue impossible . "
at the same time , the chancellor defended the security measures that have been implemented in germany in the run-up to the summit .

the deal would give e.on access to an electricity market which is growing at an annual rate of five to six percent , the company said in a written statement .
" the upcoming liberalization of russia 's wholesale electricity sector will create an attractive business environment for investment in electricity generation , " it added .
ambitious plans e.on said that its long-term goal was to build up a strong position in the rapidly growing industrial regions in the urals , western siberia , volga , as well as in central russia .
the new joint venture , which will be based in tyumen in western siberia , is also aiming to reinforce its market presence in the region by participating in the privatization of russian state power company tgk-10 .
sts is involved in both power production and distribution and supplies some 1.1 million gas and electricity customers in western siberia .
it plans to transfer some of its own generating capacity into the new joint venture , e.on said .
the german company has not revealed how much money it will be investing in its project .
the news comes shortly after e.on 's plans to takeover spain 's endesa failed at the beginning of april .
sector privatization e.on has been keen to gain access to the russian electricity market for some time , but the sector has remained firmly in state hands .
russia 's state-owned holding compay rao ues is now taking steps to liberalize the electricity market to respond to the growing demand for power .
the industry , according to e.on , will require annual investments of some 15 billion euros over the next 15 years .
this is not merely a matter of modernizing power plants and grids , but also building new plants .

the deal would give e.on access to an electricity market which is growing at an annual rate of five to six percent , the company said in a written statement .
" the upcoming liberalization of russia 's wholesale electricity sector will create an attractive business environment for investment in electricity generation , " it added .
ambitious plans e.on said that its long-term goal was to build up a strong position in the rapidly growing industrial regions in the urals , western siberia , volga , as well as in central russia .
the new joint venture , which will be based in tyumen in western siberia , is also aiming to reinforce its market presence in the region by participating in the privatization of russian state power company tgk-10 .
sts is involved in both power production and distribution and supplies some 1.1 million gas and electricity customers in western siberia .
it plans to transfer some of its own generating capacity into the new joint venture , e.on said .
the german company has not revealed how much money it will be investing in its project .
the news comes shortly after e.on 's plans to takeover spain 's endesa failed at the beginning of april .
sector privatization e.on has been keen to gain access to the russian electricity market for some time , but the sector has remained firmly in state hands .
russia 's state-owned holding compay rao ues is now taking steps to liberalize the electricity market to respond to the growing demand for power .
the industry , according to e.on , will require annual investments of some 15 billion euros over the next 15 years .

in an interview , the head of the stasi museum in leipzig explains why the issue is so emotive . tobias hollitzer is the head of the stasi " runde ecke " museum in the eastern german city of leipzig .
a row of sealed jars , each containing a seemingly innocuous yellow dust cloth , forms part of the museum 's permanent exhibition .
but these jars were part of the east german secret police 's collection of scent samples used to keep track of dissidents . hollitzer talked to dw-world.de about the stasi 's collection of people 's smells and what he thinks of law enforcement using the method today . dw-world.de : mr. hollitzer , the east german secret police , the stasi , collected scent samples .
why ? the stasi had a whole range of methods and means to try to track down people who said or did anything critical of the east german communist regime . collecting scent samples was used to try to identify those , for example , who had distributed flyers or who wrote critical graffiti . how did the stasi collect these samples ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained dogs are used to identify people 's smells when they found a piece of graffiti or a flyer then they took a dust cloth , which was usually yellow , and left it for a while lying next to the flyers covered by a protective piece of aluminum foil and then they had their sample .
the cloth was then sealed in a pickling jar and stored .
if the stasi later came across a suspect in the process of the investigation , they tried to get a sample from this person as well - of course , secretly .
a trained dog was given the two smells , and if they matched , the stasi had a concrete name . how did the stasi collected samples from people secretly ? they would often invite someone in for a talk with the police or other officials , for example , and undercover stasi officers pretending to be police officers or an administrative person were usually present at this meeting .
and while the person sat on the chair in the office , they would be , without knowing it , impregnating a yellow cloth hidden under the seat .
when this fictive visit was over , the stasi officer would then put the cloth in the pickle jar - and they had their sample . was scent sampling a method developed by the stasi ? no , it 's a well-known police method used in criminal investigations , but even in the gdr it was n't allowed to be admitted as evidence and that 's why the samples were often collected secretly instead of openly .
the problem is not with scent profiling as such , but rather with collecting scents as a precautionary measure in case they can eventually be used in the future .
this is what the stasi did - they had a giant scent register of dissidents .
they really tried to have a sample of everyone who potentially could have said something critical of the state how many samples are we talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi collected as much information as possible about people i 'm not sure of concrete numbers because in 1989 -lrb- when the berlin wall fell -rrb- the samples were destroyed and they are n't listed in the stasi files .
but just in the leipzig area , it would have certainly been several thousand . what do you think of current reports that german police have collected scent samples from activists who could be involved in violence in the lead-up to the g8 summit ? i think it is important to be very clear that the danger of the method is using it without having a concrete crime .
collecting samples on the suspicion that people could protest or offend in the future clearly harks back to stasi times , when security officials operated without any type of state limitation . in these times of the so-called war on terror , do you think the german state is going too far in its security activities ? the state has being going too far for a very long time - it 's just that now the issues surrounding the collection of scent samples are making this evident because here in germany , the stasi are so strongly associated with this particular method . if you take a look at what has happened here since sept 11. with new security laws , then we have to ask the question of how much freedom we want to sacrifice in the name of security .

can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .
today our work is more complex and that makes it more difficult .
the suffering is not as striking and not as visible as it was then , but it 's nevertheless just as big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey is on his second mission in darfur chancellor angela merkel was critical this week at the africa summit and said that african states should guarantee that aid actually arrives where it 's needed .
what 's your opinion about this ?
the criticism is valid .
aid is often not given where it 's needed most but where it brings the most political gain .
doctors without borders is active where medical assistance is needed the most .
for this reason , we 're also present in the places where other organizations do n't go .
the darfur conflict will be discussed this week by the un human rights council and again in june at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
what are your expectations for these conferences ?
i 'm hopeful but i do n't have any big expectations .
aside from the meetings , it is my wish that the people wo n't have to live in camps any longer but can live at home and at peace with each other , and that they really have all the medical assistance that they need .
but that 's an optimistic wish .
it 's important that the people here are n't forgotten in the near future , which unfortunately happens often when a conflict drags on for years .
matthias hrubey is a general practitioner and the associate national coordinator for doctors without borders in darfur .
along with 100 international and more than 2,000 local colleagues , he provides medical attention to those who need it .

" the presidency urgently appeals to iran to reconsider its policy and to comply with the demands of the international community , " the eu presidency said in statement . it said the european union has taken note of the latest report of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on iran with " great concern . " in the report , iaea director mohamed elbaradei accused iran of failing to cooperate with his agency 's inspectors and said that he agreed with us assessments that iran could acquire nuclear weapons within the next decade . " in other words three to eight years from now , " he said . the eu said the report confirmed that iran has flouted two recent un resolutions demanding that the islamic republic suspend uranium enrichment , which is at the heart of its standoff with the west .

peter danckert : the additional confessions did n't come as a surprise to me .
for quite some time i 've been aware that doping is widespread , not only in germany but also in the international cycling scene .
i expect more to come in the next few days and months .
i also think that the confessions are not going to stop at the german border .
what are the biggest challenges in the fight against doping ?
we are dealing with widespread doping in cycling and other olympic sports that are less in the public eye at the moment .
we are working with deficient analysis systems and the testing labs are lagging behind and trying very painstakingly , despite a lack of financial resources , to track down what the economy and the pharmaceutical industry have put on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping is not limited to cyclists it 's becoming more and more apparent to me , when i make an appeal for amnesty-like regulations , that there are large groups within the organized sport scene that do n't even want this , for reasons that i do n't understand .
there is a considerable lack of information concerning the extent of doping , the structures , and the participation of doctors , managers , trainers and possibly even sponsors .
the very first goal must be to gather a picture of the situation that is as comprehensive as possible .
for me , sanctions are the second priority .
i ca n't expect active athletes to commit social or professional suicide by handing in a confession - and i ca n't offer them anything for it either .
they need a second chance and they can only get one if they have the opportunity to explain themselves openly without having to fear sanctions .
some sports organizations , such as the german olympic sport association -lrb- dosb -rrb- , have said that sanctions are more effective than legal penalties .
why are sanctions less important for you ?
there have to be effective legal measure in place , on the one hand .
we 'll have them when the law that is now on the table is passed in the beginning of july , because then the possession of moderate amounts of doping substances will be punishable by law , which gives the authorities a new and more effective approach .
on the other hand , we need understanding on the part of the sports organization .
they have to recognize that their entire sanction system has not been particularly effective .
they 've continually had cases where the doping test results were positive only by coincidence .
and since the tests are n't very effective , the fact that there are relatively few positive tests is n't proof that doping does n't happen but that the doping investigation methods are n't effective .
are you satisfied with the new anti-doping law that is set to be passed in germany in early july ?
to be honest , it does n't totally fulfil my expectations .
i would have wanted more extensive provisions .
but that 's politics .
when you have a coalition partner , you have to discuss with the partner and reach a solution .
as the old saying goes , " politics is the art of the doable . "
we have a law underway that i believe will offer additional investigation approaches in the future .
the federal bureau of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- will take responsibility , the range of punishment will become broader , telephone surveillance may become possible , and maybe a leniency program as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , it has been difficult to legally implicate doctors involved in doping cases if the sport scene does its part as well , then the chances are good that the situation will improve .
what can the sport scene do ?
and how can the sport scene and the government work together ?
it 's my hope that , after the statements from four professional cyclists and two doctors in the past few days , the sport world has recognized that these are not isolated cases but that mass doping is now the order of the day .
these are not isolated cases , even looking beyond germany 's borders .
i was in rome recently and spoke with recognized doping experts who said that it 's also widespread in italy , not only in cycling but in other olympic sports as well .
there are considerable deficits in many areas that can only be corrected with the help of the sport world .
for example , we have to convince the sponsors to contribute one percent of their sponsoring funds - which in germany alone amount to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - to the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- so that more can be done for prevention , training checks , competition checks and doping analysis .
that 's where the sport world can get involved - but they have to want to .
in many cases , it 's not just the athletes themselves who are involved in a doping case , but also trainers , managers and even doctors .
to what extent should these people also be subject to penalties ?
a lot has been achieved through the amendment to the pharmaceutical laws , which defines the legal penalties that deal with doping .
it used to be the case that only the sale of illegal substances was punishable .
now , when the law is passed in early july , the possession of moderate amounts of illegal substances will also be punishable .
for the police , the prosecutors and later for the courts , this is an additional and very effective way to fight doping .
it 's not only the athlete that is involved but also the trainers , the managers , the doctors and everyone surrounding the athlete that has been legally untouchable until now .
this will be different in the future and , with the federal bureau of criminal investigation , we have a very effective authority to take care of the job .

i also think that the confessions are not going to stop at the german border .
what are the biggest challenges in the fight against doping ?
we are dealing with widespread doping in cycling and other olympic sports that are less in the public eye at the moment .

can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .
today our work is more complex and that makes it more difficult .
the suffering is not as striking and not as visible as it was then , but it 's nevertheless just as big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey is on his second mission in darfur chancellor angela merkel was critical this week at the africa summit and said that african states should guarantee that aid actually arrives where it 's needed .
what 's your opinion about this ?
the criticism is valid .
aid is often not given where it 's needed most but where it brings the most political gain .
doctors without borders is active where medical assistance is needed the most .
for this reason , we 're also present in the places where other organizations do n't go .
the darfur conflict will be discussed this week by the un human rights council and again in june at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
what are your expectations for these conferences ?
i 'm hopeful but i do n't have any big expectations .
aside from the meetings , it is my wish that the people wo n't have to live in camps any longer but can live at home and at peace with each other , and that they really have all the medical assistance that they need .
but that 's an optimistic wish .
it 's important that the people here are n't forgotten in the near future , which unfortunately happens often when a conflict drags on for years .
matthias hrubey is a general practitioner and the associate national coordinator for doctors without borders in darfur .
along with 100 international and more than 2,000 local colleagues , he provides medical attention to those who need it .

it was a triumphant finale to a season which started with the club being docked eight points for their involvement in italy 's match-fixing scandal .
only a successful appeal against an initial , heavier , penalty enabled milan to enter the champions league at all , and they were forced to begin their campaign in the final qualifying round .
defying the odds " it is the greatest victory we have had , " ac milan coach carlo ancelotti said .
" few believed we could do it , but we have actually done something extraordinary that very few people , perhaps nobody , expected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool supporters dreams crushed in athens on wednesday .
liverpool 's chances of pulling a repeat of their 2005 victory over ancelotti 's men were dealt a severe blow by milan 's opening goal : an andrea pirlo free-kick that beat jose reina with the help of a deflection off inzaghi 's shoulder .
the striker had no hesitation in claiming the credit for the goal .
" of course we worked on that in training and sometimes it comes off , " he said , apparently tongue-in-cheek .
liverpool bruised , but gracious liverpool boss rafael benitez was enraged by the scarcity of extra time , but played down his touchline explosion afterwards .
" i do n't want to use this as an excuse , " the spaniard said .
" we were playing well until we conceded the first goal , and they have players with the quality to make the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final in athens : liverpool started out strong , but could n't match filippo inzaghi 's double strike .
" we were controlling the game , going forward and creating chances but we conceded a bad goal at a bad time , " benitez said .
line up changes failed with just under an hour gone , benitez introduced harry kewell .
but he proved no more effective than the man he replaced , bolo zenden .
the manager rejected suggestions he should have been bolder and started with the australian winger rather than packing five men across his midfield .
" kewell could not play a long time , he was ten months without playing , " benitez said . " milan are well organized in defence and good on counter attack .
when you try to attack , you have to keep a balance and not leave big spaces behind .
when you lose the balance against them they just need one opportunity and they will kill you . "
lucky opening goal ancelotti acknowledged that milan 's opening goal had been the lucky break his side needed against opponents who posed them far more problems than manchester united had in the semi-final .
" liverpool did not let us play the way we wanted in the first half , " ancelotti said .
" our midfielders were under pressure and we did not get the ball to kaka and clarence seedorf as much as we wanted . "

can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .
today our work is more complex and that makes it more difficult .
the suffering is not as striking and not as visible as it was then , but it 's nevertheless just as big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey is on his second mission in darfur chancellor angela merkel was critical this week at the africa summit and said that african states should guarantee that aid actually arrives where it 's needed .
what 's your opinion about this ?
the criticism is valid .
aid is often not given where it 's needed most but where it brings the most political gain .
doctors without borders is active where medical assistance is needed the most .
for this reason , we 're also present in the places where other organizations do n't go .
the darfur conflict will be discussed this week by the un human rights council and again in june at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
what are your expectations for these conferences ?
i 'm hopeful but i do n't have any big expectations .
aside from the meetings , it is my wish that the people wo n't have to live in camps any longer but can live at home and at peace with each other , and that they really have all the medical assistance that they need .
but that 's an optimistic wish .
it 's important that the people here are n't forgotten in the near future , which unfortunately happens often when a conflict drags on for years .
matthias hrubey is a general practitioner and the associate national coordinator for doctors without borders in darfur .
along with 100 international and more than 2,000 local colleagues , he provides medical attention to those who need it .

can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .
today our work is more complex and that makes it more difficult .
the suffering is not as striking and not as visible as it was then , but it 's nevertheless just as big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey is on his second mission in darfur chancellor angela merkel was critical this week at the africa summit and said that african states should guarantee that aid actually arrives where it 's needed .
what 's your opinion about this ?
the criticism is valid .
aid is often not given where it 's needed most but where it brings the most political gain .
doctors without borders is active where medical assistance is needed the most .
for this reason , we 're also present in the places where other organizations do n't go .
the darfur conflict will be discussed this week by the un human rights council and again in june at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
what are your expectations for these conferences ?
i 'm hopeful but i do n't have any big expectations .
aside from the meetings , it is my wish that the people wo n't have to live in camps any longer but can live at home and at peace with each other , and that they really have all the medical assistance that they need .
but that 's an optimistic wish .
it 's important that the people here are n't forgotten in the near future , which unfortunately happens often when a conflict drags on for years .
matthias hrubey is a general practitioner and the associate national coordinator for doctors without borders in darfur .
along with 100 international and more than 2,000 local colleagues , he provides medical attention to those who need it .

it was a triumphant finale to a season which started with the club being docked eight points for their involvement in italy 's match-fixing scandal .
only a successful appeal against an initial , heavier , penalty enabled milan to enter the champions league at all , and they were forced to begin their campaign in the final qualifying round .
defying the odds " it is the greatest victory we have had , " ac milan coach carlo ancelotti said .
" few believed we could do it , but we have actually done something extraordinary that very few people , perhaps nobody , expected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool supporters dreams crushed in athens on wednesday .
liverpool 's chances of pulling a repeat of their 2005 victory over ancelotti 's men were dealt a severe blow by milan 's opening goal : an andrea pirlo free-kick that beat jose reina with the help of a deflection off inzaghi 's shoulder .
the striker had no hesitation in claiming the credit for the goal .
" of course we worked on that in training and sometimes it comes off , " he said , apparently tongue-in-cheek .
liverpool bruised , but gracious liverpool boss rafael benitez was enraged by the scarcity of extra time , but played down his touchline explosion afterwards .
" i do n't want to use this as an excuse , " the spaniard said .
" we were playing well until we conceded the first goal , and they have players with the quality to make the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final in athens : liverpool started out strong , but could n't match filippo inzaghi 's double strike .
" we were controlling the game , going forward and creating chances but we conceded a bad goal at a bad time , " benitez said .
line up changes failed with just under an hour gone , benitez introduced harry kewell .
but he proved no more effective than the man he replaced , bolo zenden .
the manager rejected suggestions he should have been bolder and started with the australian winger rather than packing five men across his midfield .
" kewell could not play a long time , he was ten months without playing , " benitez said . " milan are well organized in defence and good on counter attack .
when you try to attack , you have to keep a balance and not leave big spaces behind .
when you lose the balance against them they just need one opportunity and they will kill you . "
lucky opening goal ancelotti acknowledged that milan 's opening goal had been the lucky break his side needed against opponents who posed them far more problems than manchester united had in the semi-final .
" liverpool did not let us play the way we wanted in the first half , " ancelotti said .
" our midfielders were under pressure and we did not get the ball to kaka and clarence seedorf as much as we wanted . "
but he said this was a tough team and they had managed a difficult situation quite well . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milan face two opponents in liverpool and foolish revenge ac milan have waited two years to avenge the 2005 champions league final defeat to liverpool .

" it is important that the g8 develops a common understand of how climate change can be tackled and what agreements can be made for the period beyond 2012 , " said merkel , referring to the year when the kyoto protocol expires .
merkel pessimistic about results the chancellor added , however , that she did n't expect concrete results to be achieved during the meeting of the group of eight industrialized countries on june 6-8 in the northern german city of heiligendamm .
" i can say quite openly that i do n't know if we will succeed in that at heiligendamm , " said merkel in her speech .
" but for me it is clear that the big developed nations must take the lead on this issue if we are to have a change at fighting climate change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 has to decide on kyoto 's successor environmental minister sigmar gabriel from the social democratic party said earlier this week in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf that said talks on climate change would be " super difficult " because of the position of the us .
" we have to put the pressure on , " he added .
germany wants code of conduct chancellor merkel on thursday also named hedge-fund transparency as a priority on the g8 agenda .
hedge-funds are an aggressive and risky investment tool estimated to incorporate some 1.5 trillion dollars world-wide .
transparency in the hedge-fund sector is " urgently necessary " to boost " confidence in the economy , " said the chancellor , adding that germany supports the development of an official code of conduct for the branch .
resistance to regulations in the hedge-fund sector has come from the us and britain , where most of the world 's 9,000 hedge-funds are located .
the chancellor acknowledged that steps had been made at the meeting of g8 finance ministers last weekend in potsdam , but , as with the climate change discussion , she also conceded that the negotiation process would need to be continued after the g8 summit .
focus on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono -lrb- left -rrb- and bob geldof have criticized the g8 development aid for africa would be another central discussion topic at the summit , said merkel , affirming that the g8 countries would honor the promises for development aid increases that they had made at their 2005 summit .
" we will keep these promises , " she said .
" the time has come to implement and our credibility is at stake . "
merkel announced that the increase in development aid could be financed with the fees the state exacts from companies for disposing of contaminating waste .
leaders from algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria , senegal and south africa have been invited to join the g8 member states as guests at the conference .
merkel defends police action in addition , merkel addressed g8 protesters .
protest must be peaceful , she said , " those who resort to violence make dialogue impossible . "
at the same time , the chancellor defended the security measures that have been implemented in germany in the run-up to the summit .

" it is important that the g8 develops a common understand of how climate change can be tackled and what agreements can be made for the period beyond 2012 , " said merkel , referring to the year when the kyoto protocol expires .
merkel pessimistic about results the chancellor added , however , that she did n't expect concrete results to be achieved during the meeting of the group of eight industrialized countries on june 6-8 in the northern german city of heiligendamm .
" i can say quite openly that i do n't know if we will succeed in that at heiligendamm , " said merkel in her speech .
" but for me it is clear that the big developed nations must take the lead on this issue if we are to have a change at fighting climate change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 has to decide on kyoto 's successor environmental minister sigmar gabriel from the social democratic party said earlier this week in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf that said talks on climate change would be " super difficult " because of the position of the us .
" we have to put the pressure on , " he added .
germany wants code of conduct chancellor merkel on thursday also named hedge-fund transparency as a priority on the g8 agenda .
hedge-funds are an aggressive and risky investment tool estimated to incorporate some 1.5 trillion dollars world-wide .
transparency in the hedge-fund sector is " urgently necessary " to boost " confidence in the economy , " said the chancellor , adding that germany supports the development of an official code of conduct for the branch .
resistance to regulations in the hedge-fund sector has come from the us and britain , where most of the world 's 9,000 hedge-funds are located .
the chancellor acknowledged that steps had been made at the meeting of g8 finance ministers last weekend in potsdam , but , as with the climate change discussion , she also conceded that the negotiation process would need to be continued after the g8 summit .
focus on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono -lrb- left -rrb- and bob geldof have criticized the g8 development aid for africa would be another central discussion topic at the summit , said merkel , affirming that the g8 countries would honor the promises for development aid increases that they had made at their 2005 summit .
" we will keep these promises , " she said .
" the time has come to implement and our credibility is at stake . "
merkel announced that the increase in development aid could be financed with the fees the state exacts from companies for disposing of contaminating waste .
leaders from algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria , senegal and south africa have been invited to join the g8 member states as guests at the conference .
merkel defends police action in addition , merkel addressed g8 protesters .
protest must be peaceful , she said , " those who resort to violence make dialogue impossible . "

" a simplified treaty is the only way forwards , " sarkozy told reporters at the joint press conference .
on his second foreign trip after his inauguration last week , the french leader said he was determined to make sure that agreement was reached at the eu summit next month .
he underlined that it was crucial that the eu break its current deadlock after french and dutch voters rejected the draft eu constitution in referenda in 2005 .
" i am convinced that europe can not remain at a standstill .
we can not remain in this relative paralysis , " said sarkozy .
" we have to find a way out of this impasse , " he added .
slimline treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy clearly wants to put france back at the heart of europe the french president would like to see the streamlined document including provision for a permanent eu presidency to replace the current rotating one , possibilities for " enhanced cooperation " between eu states and a move from unanimity to majority voting .
immigration issues should also be covered by the new treaty , he said .
a new eu rulebook is needed to ensure efficient and rapid decision-making in a bloc which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states over recent years .
the french president emphasised that the scaled-down treaty should be agreed by the member states ' parliaments rather than being put to the people .
during a debate about the constitutional crisis in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the concept of an " eu constitution " had put off many dutch voters who see the document as a threat to national sovereignty .
problematic symbol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is one of the dissenting voices in the debate " it is clear that the symbol of the constitution was an important reason for the no vote , " said balkenende .
he stressed the need for reform , but called for it to be achieved in small steps .
but some important european players reject the idea of scaling down the constitution .
italian prime minister romano prodi has attacked the idea of the french " mini-treaty " and threatened that a vanguard of european nations who want closer integration could go it alone .
germany , which currently holds the rotating six-month eu presidency , has also said repeatedly that it wants the " substance " of the constitution to be preserved and the charter of fundamental rights to be annexed to the new treaty .
chancellor angela merkel has made resurrecting the failed constitution a top priority .

" a simplified treaty is the only way forwards , " sarkozy told reporters at the joint press conference .
on his second foreign trip after his inauguration last week , the french leader said he was determined to make sure that agreement was reached at the eu summit next month .
he underlined that it was crucial that the eu break its current deadlock after french and dutch voters rejected the draft eu constitution in referenda in 2005 .
" i am convinced that europe can not remain at a standstill .
we can not remain in this relative paralysis , " said sarkozy .
" we have to find a way out of this impasse , " he added .
slimline treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy clearly wants to put france back at the heart of europe the french president would like to see the streamlined document including provision for a permanent eu presidency to replace the current rotating one , possibilities for " enhanced cooperation " between eu states and a move from unanimity to majority voting .
immigration issues should also be covered by the new treaty , he said .
a new eu rulebook is needed to ensure efficient and rapid decision-making in a bloc which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states over recent years .
the french president emphasised that the scaled-down treaty should be agreed by the member states ' parliaments rather than being put to the people .
during a debate about the constitutional crisis in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the concept of an " eu constitution " had put off many dutch voters who see the document as a threat to national sovereignty .
problematic symbol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is one of the dissenting voices in the debate " it is clear that the symbol of the constitution was an important reason for the no vote , " said balkenende .
he stressed the need for reform , but called for it to be achieved in small steps .
but some important european players reject the idea of scaling down the constitution .
italian prime minister romano prodi has attacked the idea of the french " mini-treaty " and threatened that a vanguard of european nations who want closer integration could go it alone .
germany , which currently holds the rotating six-month eu presidency , has also said repeatedly that it wants the " substance " of the constitution to be preserved and the charter of fundamental rights to be annexed to the new treaty .
chancellor angela merkel has made resurrecting the failed constitution a top priority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.05.2007 rich g8 countries need to fulfill promises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is time to hold governments accountable , says jeffrey sachs jeffrey sachs , director of the earth institute at columbia university and special advisor to un secretary general ban ki-moon , outlines what action the g8 must take to end poverty and retain credibility . the millennium development goals are the world ’ s agreed goals to cut poverty , hunger , and disease . they were established in 2000 , with targets for 2015 . we are at the half-way point to meet the goals .
so far , the rich g8 countries are not meeting their part of the bargain , despite endless words from the rich countries about increasing their aid to the poor countries . when new donor countries such as china enter the scene , the us and europe tend to complain , as if their monopoly over low-income africa and asia is being broken . the political standing of the g8 in the world will plummet if it is unable or unwilling to follow through on its word . though the g8 promised to double aid to africa at the 2005 gleneagles summit , there is no plan on how to do so . for the first year after gleneagles , the reported aid numbers were padded by misleading accounting on debt cancellation operations . with those debt cancellation operations largely completed , the data are now revealing the stark truth . development aid to africa , and to poor countries more generally , is stagnant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles 2005 - it is now time to fulfil those promises specifically , between 2005 and 2006 , overall aid to africa , excluding debt cancellation operations , showed a meager increase of 2 percent , far off track from a path of doubling aid . total official development assistance to all recipient countries , net of debt cancellation , actually declined by 2 percent between 2005 and 2006 . even the world bank , usually taking the donors ’ point of view , recently acknowledged that except for debt cancellation , “ promises of scaled up aid have not been delivered . ” all of this would seem to be insurmountable if the basic economics were not so clear . we are not talking about an unachievable amount of money from the rich countries . indeed what we are talking about is minuscule . the g8 , representing nearly 1 billion people in high-income countries , has promised to increase aid to africa from $ 25 billion in 2004 to $ 50 billion in 2010 . that $ 25 billion is less than one-tenth of one percent of the income of the rich donor world ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the christmas bonuses this year on wall street amounted to $ 24 billion " to put it in perspective , the christmas bonuses this year on wall street - just the bonuses - amounted to $ 24 billion ! the spending on the war in iraq , which accomplishes nothing but violence , is more than $ 100 billion per year . the g8 could easily honor its commitments , if the rich countries had the slightest concern to do so . to salvage the g8 ’ s dwindling credibility , here is what needs to be done . first , the g8 needs to make crystal clear that it will honor its commitment to increase aid to africa by $ 25 billion per year , so that total aid reaches $ 50 billion per year .
that way , the cynics within the g8 governments can understand their assignments . second , the g8 needs to put forward a plan of action . the lack of specific commitments by specific countries is shocking , and a display of governance at its poorest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " progress in the fight against poverty will contribute not only to survival and human dignity , but also to peace " third , the recipient countries need to be told of the year-to-year increases in aid that they can expect , so that they can plan ahead to the year 2010 . the increased aid should be directed at building roads , power grids , schools , and clinics , and at training teachers , doctors , and community health workers . yet all of that investment requires plans and years of implementation . aid needs to be committed in clear terms over a period of several years , so that recipient countries can use it sensibly and accountably . african countries have already identified their high-priority investments in health , education , agriculture , and infrastructure -lrb- including roads , power , and internet connectivity -rrb- . these investments could be increased systematically during the period from now until 2015 , in order to enable those countries to achieve the millennium development goals . it ’ s time for the rich countries to stop giving lectures to the poor , and instead to follow through on their own words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey sachs progress in the fight against poverty will contribute not only to survival and human dignity , but also to peace . it is time , therefore , to hold our governments accountable for what they have pledged but not delivered . professor jeffrey sachs is director of the earth institute at columbia university and special advisor to un secretary general ban ki-moon .

in an interview , the head of the stasi museum in leipzig explains why the issue is so emotive . tobias hollitzer is the head of the stasi " runde ecke " museum in the eastern german city of leipzig .
a row of sealed jars , each containing a seemingly innocuous yellow dust cloth , forms part of the museum 's permanent exhibition .
but these jars were part of the east german secret police 's collection of scent samples used to keep track of dissidents . hollitzer talked to dw-world.de about the stasi 's collection of people 's smells and what he thinks of law enforcement using the method today . dw-world.de : mr. hollitzer , the east german secret police , the stasi , collected scent samples .
why ? the stasi had a whole range of methods and means to try to track down people who said or did anything critical of the east german communist regime . collecting scent samples was used to try to identify those , for example , who had distributed flyers or who wrote critical graffiti . how did the stasi collect these samples ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained dogs are used to identify people 's smells when they found a piece of graffiti or a flyer then they took a dust cloth , which was usually yellow , and left it for a while lying next to the flyers covered by a protective piece of aluminum foil and then they had their sample .
the cloth was then sealed in a pickling jar and stored .
if the stasi later came across a suspect in the process of the investigation , they tried to get a sample from this person as well - of course , secretly .
a trained dog was given the two smells , and if they matched , the stasi had a concrete name . how did the stasi collected samples from people secretly ? they would often invite someone in for a talk with the police or other officials , for example , and undercover stasi officers pretending to be police officers or an administrative person were usually present at this meeting .
and while the person sat on the chair in the office , they would be , without knowing it , impregnating a yellow cloth hidden under the seat .
when this fictive visit was over , the stasi officer would then put the cloth in the pickle jar - and they had their sample . was scent sampling a method developed by the stasi ? no , it 's a well-known police method used in criminal investigations , but even in the gdr it was n't allowed to be admitted as evidence and that 's why the samples were often collected secretly instead of openly .
the problem is not with scent profiling as such , but rather with collecting scents as a precautionary measure in case they can eventually be used in the future .
this is what the stasi did - they had a giant scent register of dissidents .
they really tried to have a sample of everyone who potentially could have said something critical of the state how many samples are we talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi collected as much information as possible about people i 'm not sure of concrete numbers because in 1989 -lrb- when the berlin wall fell -rrb- the samples were destroyed and they are n't listed in the stasi files .
but just in the leipzig area , it would have certainly been several thousand . what do you think of current reports that german police have collected scent samples from activists who could be involved in violence in the lead-up to the g8 summit ? i think it is important to be very clear that the danger of the method is using it without having a concrete crime .
collecting samples on the suspicion that people could protest or offend in the future clearly harks back to stasi times , when security officials operated without any type of state limitation . in these times of the so-called war on terror , do you think the german state is going too far in its security activities ? the state has being going too far for a very long time - it 's just that now the issues surrounding the collection of scent samples are making this evident because here in germany , the stasi are so strongly associated with this particular method . if you take a look at what has happened here since sept 11. with new security laws , then we have to ask the question of how much freedom we want to sacrifice in the name of security .

in an interview , the head of the stasi museum in leipzig explains why the issue is so emotive . tobias hollitzer is the head of the stasi " runde ecke " museum in the eastern german city of leipzig .
a row of sealed jars , each containing a seemingly innocuous yellow dust cloth , forms part of the museum 's permanent exhibition .
but these jars were part of the east german secret police 's collection of scent samples used to keep track of dissidents . hollitzer talked to dw-world.de about the stasi 's collection of people 's smells and what he thinks of law enforcement using the method today . dw-world.de : mr. hollitzer , the east german secret police , the stasi , collected scent samples .
why ? the stasi had a whole range of methods and means to try to track down people who said or did anything critical of the east german communist regime . collecting scent samples was used to try to identify those , for example , who had distributed flyers or who wrote critical graffiti . how did the stasi collect these samples ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained dogs are used to identify people 's smells when they found a piece of graffiti or a flyer then they took a dust cloth , which was usually yellow , and left it for a while lying next to the flyers covered by a protective piece of aluminum foil and then they had their sample .
the cloth was then sealed in a pickling jar and stored .
if the stasi later came across a suspect in the process of the investigation , they tried to get a sample from this person as well - of course , secretly .
a trained dog was given the two smells , and if they matched , the stasi had a concrete name . how did the stasi collected samples from people secretly ? they would often invite someone in for a talk with the police or other officials , for example , and undercover stasi officers pretending to be police officers or an administrative person were usually present at this meeting .
and while the person sat on the chair in the office , they would be , without knowing it , impregnating a yellow cloth hidden under the seat .
when this fictive visit was over , the stasi officer would then put the cloth in the pickle jar - and they had their sample . was scent sampling a method developed by the stasi ? no , it 's a well-known police method used in criminal investigations , but even in the gdr it was n't allowed to be admitted as evidence and that 's why the samples were often collected secretly instead of openly .
the problem is not with scent profiling as such , but rather with collecting scents as a precautionary measure in case they can eventually be used in the future .
this is what the stasi did - they had a giant scent register of dissidents .
they really tried to have a sample of everyone who potentially could have said something critical of the state how many samples are we talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi collected as much information as possible about people i 'm not sure of concrete numbers because in 1989 -lrb- when the berlin wall fell -rrb- the samples were destroyed and they are n't listed in the stasi files .
but just in the leipzig area , it would have certainly been several thousand . what do you think of current reports that german police have collected scent samples from activists who could be involved in violence in the lead-up to the g8 summit ? i think it is important to be very clear that the danger of the method is using it without having a concrete crime .
collecting samples on the suspicion that people could protest or offend in the future clearly harks back to stasi times , when security officials operated without any type of state limitation . in these times of the so-called war on terror , do you think the german state is going too far in its security activities ? the state has being going too far for a very long time - it 's just that now the issues surrounding the collection of scent samples are making this evident because here in germany , the stasi are so strongly associated with this particular method . if you take a look at what has happened here since sept 11. with new security laws , then we have to ask the question of how much freedom we want to sacrifice in the name of security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.05.2007 rich g8 countries need to fulfill promises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is time to hold governments accountable , says jeffrey sachs jeffrey sachs , director of the earth institute at columbia university and special advisor to un secretary general ban ki-moon , outlines what action the g8 must take to end poverty and retain credibility . the millennium development goals are the world ’ s agreed goals to cut poverty , hunger , and disease . they were established in 2000 , with targets for 2015 . we are at the half-way point to meet the goals .
so far , the rich g8 countries are not meeting their part of the bargain , despite endless words from the rich countries about increasing their aid to the poor countries . when new donor countries such as china enter the scene , the us and europe tend to complain , as if their monopoly over low-income africa and asia is being broken . the political standing of the g8 in the world will plummet if it is unable or unwilling to follow through on its word . though the g8 promised to double aid to africa at the 2005 gleneagles summit , there is no plan on how to do so . for the first year after gleneagles , the reported aid numbers were padded by misleading accounting on debt cancellation operations . with those debt cancellation operations largely completed , the data are now revealing the stark truth . development aid to africa , and to poor countries more generally , is stagnant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles 2005 - it is now time to fulfil those promises specifically , between 2005 and 2006 , overall aid to africa , excluding debt cancellation operations , showed a meager increase of 2 percent , far off track from a path of doubling aid . total official development assistance to all recipient countries , net of debt cancellation , actually declined by 2 percent between 2005 and 2006 . even the world bank , usually taking the donors ’ point of view , recently acknowledged that except for debt cancellation , “ promises of scaled up aid have not been delivered . ” all of this would seem to be insurmountable if the basic economics were not so clear . we are not talking about an unachievable amount of money from the rich countries . indeed what we are talking about is minuscule . the g8 , representing nearly 1 billion people in high-income countries , has promised to increase aid to africa from $ 25 billion in 2004 to $ 50 billion in 2010 . that $ 25 billion is less than one-tenth of one percent of the income of the rich donor world ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the christmas bonuses this year on wall street amounted to $ 24 billion " to put it in perspective , the christmas bonuses this year on wall street - just the bonuses - amounted to $ 24 billion ! the spending on the war in iraq , which accomplishes nothing but violence , is more than $ 100 billion per year . the g8 could easily honor its commitments , if the rich countries had the slightest concern to do so . to salvage the g8 ’ s dwindling credibility , here is what needs to be done . first , the g8 needs to make crystal clear that it will honor its commitment to increase aid to africa by $ 25 billion per year , so that total aid reaches $ 50 billion per year .
that way , the cynics within the g8 governments can understand their assignments . second , the g8 needs to put forward a plan of action . the lack of specific commitments by specific countries is shocking , and a display of governance at its poorest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " progress in the fight against poverty will contribute not only to survival and human dignity , but also to peace " third , the recipient countries need to be told of the year-to-year increases in aid that they can expect , so that they can plan ahead to the year 2010 . the increased aid should be directed at building roads , power grids , schools , and clinics , and at training teachers , doctors , and community health workers . yet all of that investment requires plans and years of implementation . aid needs to be committed in clear terms over a period of several years , so that recipient countries can use it sensibly and accountably . african countries have already identified their high-priority investments in health , education , agriculture , and infrastructure -lrb- including roads , power , and internet connectivity -rrb- . these investments could be increased systematically during the period from now until 2015 , in order to enable those countries to achieve the millennium development goals . it ’ s time for the rich countries to stop giving lectures to the poor , and instead to follow through on their own words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey sachs progress in the fight against poverty will contribute not only to survival and human dignity , but also to peace . it is time , therefore , to hold our governments accountable for what they have pledged but not delivered . professor jeffrey sachs is director of the earth institute at columbia university and special advisor to un secretary general ban ki-moon .

so far , the rich g8 countries are not meeting their part of the bargain , despite endless words from the rich countries about increasing their aid to the poor countries . when new donor countries such as china enter the scene , the us and europe tend to complain , as if their monopoly over low-income africa and asia is being broken . the political standing of the g8 in the world will plummet if it is unable or unwilling to follow through on its word . though the g8 promised to double aid to africa at the 2005 gleneagles summit , there is no plan on how to do so . for the first year after gleneagles , the reported aid numbers were padded by misleading accounting on debt cancellation operations . with those debt cancellation operations largely completed , the data are now revealing the stark truth . development aid to africa , and to poor countries more generally , is stagnant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles 2005 - it is now time to fulfil those promises specifically , between 2005 and 2006 , overall aid to africa , excluding debt cancellation operations , showed a meager increase of 2 percent , far off track from a path of doubling aid . total official development assistance to all recipient countries , net of debt cancellation , actually declined by 2 percent between 2005 and 2006 . even the world bank , usually taking the donors ’ point of view , recently acknowledged that except for debt cancellation , “ promises of scaled up aid have not been delivered . ” all of this would seem to be insurmountable if the basic economics were not so clear . we are not talking about an unachievable amount of money from the rich countries . indeed what we are talking about is minuscule . the g8 , representing nearly 1 billion people in high-income countries , has promised to increase aid to africa from $ 25 billion in 2004 to $ 50 billion in 2010 . that $ 25 billion is less than one-tenth of one percent of the income of the rich donor world ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the christmas bonuses this year on wall street amounted to $ 24 billion " to put it in perspective , the christmas bonuses this year on wall street - just the bonuses - amounted to $ 24 billion ! the spending on the war in iraq , which accomplishes nothing but violence , is more than $ 100 billion per year . the g8 could easily honor its commitments , if the rich countries had the slightest concern to do so . to salvage the g8 ’ s dwindling credibility , here is what needs to be done . first , the g8 needs to make crystal clear that it will honor its commitment to increase aid to africa by $ 25 billion per year , so that total aid reaches $ 50 billion per year .
that way , the cynics within the g8 governments can understand their assignments . second , the g8 needs to put forward a plan of action . the lack of specific commitments by specific countries is shocking , and a display of governance at its poorest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " progress in the fight against poverty will contribute not only to survival and human dignity , but also to peace " third , the recipient countries need to be told of the year-to-year increases in aid that they can expect , so that they can plan ahead to the year 2010 . the increased aid should be directed at building roads , power grids , schools , and clinics , and at training teachers , doctors , and community health workers . yet all of that investment requires plans and years of implementation . aid needs to be committed in clear terms over a period of several years , so that recipient countries can use it sensibly and accountably . african countries have already identified their high-priority investments in health , education , agriculture , and infrastructure -lrb- including roads , power , and internet connectivity -rrb- . these investments could be increased systematically during the period from now until 2015 , in order to enable those countries to achieve the millennium development goals . it ’ s time for the rich countries to stop giving lectures to the poor , and instead to follow through on their own words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey sachs progress in the fight against poverty will contribute not only to survival and human dignity , but also to peace . it is time , therefore , to hold our governments accountable for what they have pledged but not delivered . professor jeffrey sachs is director of the earth institute at columbia university and special advisor to un secretary general ban ki-moon .

the deal would give e.on access to an electricity market which is growing at an annual rate of five to six percent , the company said in a written statement .
" the upcoming liberalization of russia 's wholesale electricity sector will create an attractive business environment for investment in electricity generation , " it added .
ambitious plans e.on said that its long-term goal was to build up a strong position in the rapidly growing industrial regions in the urals , western siberia , volga , as well as in central russia .
the new joint venture , which will be based in tyumen in western siberia , is also aiming to reinforce its market presence in the region by participating in the privatization of russian state power company tgk-10 .
sts is involved in both power production and distribution and supplies some 1.1 million gas and electricity customers in western siberia .
it plans to transfer some of its own generating capacity into the new joint venture , e.on said .
the german company has not revealed how much money it will be investing in its project .
the news comes shortly after e.on 's plans to takeover spain 's endesa failed at the beginning of april .
sector privatization e.on has been keen to gain access to the russian electricity market for some time , but the sector has remained firmly in state hands .
russia 's state-owned holding compay rao ues is now taking steps to liberalize the electricity market to respond to the growing demand for power .
the industry , according to e.on , will require annual investments of some 15 billion euros over the next 15 years .
this is not merely a matter of modernizing power plants and grids , but also building new plants .
e.on said by increasing the efficiency of russian power plants it will also be able to help improve the environment . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic eon is moving in on the russian energy market feedback send us an e-mail .

peter danckert : the additional confessions did n't come as a surprise to me .
for quite some time i 've been aware that doping is widespread , not only in germany but also in the international cycling scene .
i expect more to come in the next few days and months .
i also think that the confessions are not going to stop at the german border .
what are the biggest challenges in the fight against doping ?
we are dealing with widespread doping in cycling and other olympic sports that are less in the public eye at the moment .
we are working with deficient analysis systems and the testing labs are lagging behind and trying very painstakingly , despite a lack of financial resources , to track down what the economy and the pharmaceutical industry have put on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping is not limited to cyclists it 's becoming more and more apparent to me , when i make an appeal for amnesty-like regulations , that there are large groups within the organized sport scene that do n't even want this , for reasons that i do n't understand .
there is a considerable lack of information concerning the extent of doping , the structures , and the participation of doctors , managers , trainers and possibly even sponsors .
the very first goal must be to gather a picture of the situation that is as comprehensive as possible .
for me , sanctions are the second priority .
i ca n't expect active athletes to commit social or professional suicide by handing in a confession - and i ca n't offer them anything for it either .
they need a second chance and they can only get one if they have the opportunity to explain themselves openly without having to fear sanctions .
some sports organizations , such as the german olympic sport association -lrb- dosb -rrb- , have said that sanctions are more effective than legal penalties .
why are sanctions less important for you ?
there have to be effective legal measure in place , on the one hand .
we 'll have them when the law that is now on the table is passed in the beginning of july , because then the possession of moderate amounts of doping substances will be punishable by law , which gives the authorities a new and more effective approach .
on the other hand , we need understanding on the part of the sports organization .
they have to recognize that their entire sanction system has not been particularly effective .
they 've continually had cases where the doping test results were positive only by coincidence .
and since the tests are n't very effective , the fact that there are relatively few positive tests is n't proof that doping does n't happen but that the doping investigation methods are n't effective .
are you satisfied with the new anti-doping law that is set to be passed in germany in early july ?
to be honest , it does n't totally fulfil my expectations .
i would have wanted more extensive provisions .
but that 's politics .
when you have a coalition partner , you have to discuss with the partner and reach a solution .
as the old saying goes , " politics is the art of the doable . "
we have a law underway that i believe will offer additional investigation approaches in the future .
the federal bureau of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- will take responsibility , the range of punishment will become broader , telephone surveillance may become possible , and maybe a leniency program as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , it has been difficult to legally implicate doctors involved in doping cases if the sport scene does its part as well , then the chances are good that the situation will improve .
what can the sport scene do ?
and how can the sport scene and the government work together ?
it 's my hope that , after the statements from four professional cyclists and two doctors in the past few days , the sport world has recognized that these are not isolated cases but that mass doping is now the order of the day .
these are not isolated cases , even looking beyond germany 's borders .
i was in rome recently and spoke with recognized doping experts who said that it 's also widespread in italy , not only in cycling but in other olympic sports as well .
there are considerable deficits in many areas that can only be corrected with the help of the sport world .
for example , we have to convince the sponsors to contribute one percent of their sponsoring funds - which in germany alone amount to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - to the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- so that more can be done for prevention , training checks , competition checks and doping analysis .
that 's where the sport world can get involved - but they have to want to .
in many cases , it 's not just the athletes themselves who are involved in a doping case , but also trainers , managers and even doctors .
to what extent should these people also be subject to penalties ?
a lot has been achieved through the amendment to the pharmaceutical laws , which defines the legal penalties that deal with doping .
it used to be the case that only the sale of illegal substances was punishable .
now , when the law is passed in early july , the possession of moderate amounts of illegal substances will also be punishable .
for the police , the prosecutors and later for the courts , this is an additional and very effective way to fight doping .
it 's not only the athlete that is involved but also the trainers , the managers , the doctors and everyone surrounding the athlete that has been legally untouchable until now .
this will be different in the future and , with the federal bureau of criminal investigation , we have a very effective authority to take care of the job .

in an interview , the head of the stasi museum in leipzig explains why the issue is so emotive . tobias hollitzer is the head of the stasi " runde ecke " museum in the eastern german city of leipzig .
a row of sealed jars , each containing a seemingly innocuous yellow dust cloth , forms part of the museum 's permanent exhibition .
but these jars were part of the east german secret police 's collection of scent samples used to keep track of dissidents . hollitzer talked to dw-world.de about the stasi 's collection of people 's smells and what he thinks of law enforcement using the method today . dw-world.de : mr. hollitzer , the east german secret police , the stasi , collected scent samples .
why ? the stasi had a whole range of methods and means to try to track down people who said or did anything critical of the east german communist regime . collecting scent samples was used to try to identify those , for example , who had distributed flyers or who wrote critical graffiti . how did the stasi collect these samples ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained dogs are used to identify people 's smells when they found a piece of graffiti or a flyer then they took a dust cloth , which was usually yellow , and left it for a while lying next to the flyers covered by a protective piece of aluminum foil and then they had their sample .
the cloth was then sealed in a pickling jar and stored .
if the stasi later came across a suspect in the process of the investigation , they tried to get a sample from this person as well - of course , secretly .
a trained dog was given the two smells , and if they matched , the stasi had a concrete name . how did the stasi collected samples from people secretly ? they would often invite someone in for a talk with the police or other officials , for example , and undercover stasi officers pretending to be police officers or an administrative person were usually present at this meeting .
and while the person sat on the chair in the office , they would be , without knowing it , impregnating a yellow cloth hidden under the seat .
when this fictive visit was over , the stasi officer would then put the cloth in the pickle jar - and they had their sample . was scent sampling a method developed by the stasi ? no , it 's a well-known police method used in criminal investigations , but even in the gdr it was n't allowed to be admitted as evidence and that 's why the samples were often collected secretly instead of openly .
the problem is not with scent profiling as such , but rather with collecting scents as a precautionary measure in case they can eventually be used in the future .
this is what the stasi did - they had a giant scent register of dissidents .
they really tried to have a sample of everyone who potentially could have said something critical of the state how many samples are we talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi collected as much information as possible about people i 'm not sure of concrete numbers because in 1989 -lrb- when the berlin wall fell -rrb- the samples were destroyed and they are n't listed in the stasi files .
but just in the leipzig area , it would have certainly been several thousand . what do you think of current reports that german police have collected scent samples from activists who could be involved in violence in the lead-up to the g8 summit ? i think it is important to be very clear that the danger of the method is using it without having a concrete crime .
collecting samples on the suspicion that people could protest or offend in the future clearly harks back to stasi times , when security officials operated without any type of state limitation . in these times of the so-called war on terror , do you think the german state is going too far in its security activities ? the state has being going too far for a very long time - it 's just that now the issues surrounding the collection of scent samples are making this evident because here in germany , the stasi are so strongly associated with this particular method . if you take a look at what has happened here since sept 11. with new security laws , then we have to ask the question of how much freedom we want to sacrifice in the name of security .
information such as telephone and internet data now has to be saved for at least six months .

can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .
today our work is more complex and that makes it more difficult .
the suffering is not as striking and not as visible as it was then , but it 's nevertheless just as big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey is on his second mission in darfur chancellor angela merkel was critical this week at the africa summit and said that african states should guarantee that aid actually arrives where it 's needed .
what 's your opinion about this ?
the criticism is valid .
aid is often not given where it 's needed most but where it brings the most political gain .
doctors without borders is active where medical assistance is needed the most .
for this reason , we 're also present in the places where other organizations do n't go .
the darfur conflict will be discussed this week by the un human rights council and again in june at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
what are your expectations for these conferences ?
i 'm hopeful but i do n't have any big expectations .
aside from the meetings , it is my wish that the people wo n't have to live in camps any longer but can live at home and at peace with each other , and that they really have all the medical assistance that they need .
but that 's an optimistic wish .
it 's important that the people here are n't forgotten in the near future , which unfortunately happens often when a conflict drags on for years .
matthias hrubey is a general practitioner and the associate national coordinator for doctors without borders in darfur .
along with 100 international and more than 2,000 local colleagues , he provides medical attention to those who need it .

" a simplified treaty is the only way forwards , " sarkozy told reporters at the joint press conference .
on his second foreign trip after his inauguration last week , the french leader said he was determined to make sure that agreement was reached at the eu summit next month .
he underlined that it was crucial that the eu break its current deadlock after french and dutch voters rejected the draft eu constitution in referenda in 2005 .
" i am convinced that europe can not remain at a standstill .
we can not remain in this relative paralysis , " said sarkozy .
" we have to find a way out of this impasse , " he added .
slimline treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy clearly wants to put france back at the heart of europe the french president would like to see the streamlined document including provision for a permanent eu presidency to replace the current rotating one , possibilities for " enhanced cooperation " between eu states and a move from unanimity to majority voting .
immigration issues should also be covered by the new treaty , he said .
a new eu rulebook is needed to ensure efficient and rapid decision-making in a bloc which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states over recent years .
the french president emphasised that the scaled-down treaty should be agreed by the member states ' parliaments rather than being put to the people .
during a debate about the constitutional crisis in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the concept of an " eu constitution " had put off many dutch voters who see the document as a threat to national sovereignty .
problematic symbol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is one of the dissenting voices in the debate " it is clear that the symbol of the constitution was an important reason for the no vote , " said balkenende .
he stressed the need for reform , but called for it to be achieved in small steps .
but some important european players reject the idea of scaling down the constitution .
italian prime minister romano prodi has attacked the idea of the french " mini-treaty " and threatened that a vanguard of european nations who want closer integration could go it alone .
germany , which currently holds the rotating six-month eu presidency , has also said repeatedly that it wants the " substance " of the constitution to be preserved and the charter of fundamental rights to be annexed to the new treaty .

it was a triumphant finale to a season which started with the club being docked eight points for their involvement in italy 's match-fixing scandal .
only a successful appeal against an initial , heavier , penalty enabled milan to enter the champions league at all , and they were forced to begin their campaign in the final qualifying round .
defying the odds " it is the greatest victory we have had , " ac milan coach carlo ancelotti said .
" few believed we could do it , but we have actually done something extraordinary that very few people , perhaps nobody , expected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool supporters dreams crushed in athens on wednesday .
liverpool 's chances of pulling a repeat of their 2005 victory over ancelotti 's men were dealt a severe blow by milan 's opening goal : an andrea pirlo free-kick that beat jose reina with the help of a deflection off inzaghi 's shoulder .
the striker had no hesitation in claiming the credit for the goal .
" of course we worked on that in training and sometimes it comes off , " he said , apparently tongue-in-cheek .
liverpool bruised , but gracious liverpool boss rafael benitez was enraged by the scarcity of extra time , but played down his touchline explosion afterwards .
" i do n't want to use this as an excuse , " the spaniard said .
" we were playing well until we conceded the first goal , and they have players with the quality to make the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final in athens : liverpool started out strong , but could n't match filippo inzaghi 's double strike .
" we were controlling the game , going forward and creating chances but we conceded a bad goal at a bad time , " benitez said .
line up changes failed with just under an hour gone , benitez introduced harry kewell .
but he proved no more effective than the man he replaced , bolo zenden .
the manager rejected suggestions he should have been bolder and started with the australian winger rather than packing five men across his midfield .
" kewell could not play a long time , he was ten months without playing , " benitez said . " milan are well organized in defence and good on counter attack .
when you try to attack , you have to keep a balance and not leave big spaces behind .
when you lose the balance against them they just need one opportunity and they will kill you . "
lucky opening goal ancelotti acknowledged that milan 's opening goal had been the lucky break his side needed against opponents who posed them far more problems than manchester united had in the semi-final .
" liverpool did not let us play the way we wanted in the first half , " ancelotti said .
" our midfielders were under pressure and we did not get the ball to kaka and clarence seedorf as much as we wanted . "
but he said this was a tough team and they had managed a difficult situation quite well . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milan face two opponents in liverpool and foolish revenge ac milan have waited two years to avenge the 2005 champions league final defeat to liverpool .

" a simplified treaty is the only way forwards , " sarkozy told reporters at the joint press conference .
on his second foreign trip after his inauguration last week , the french leader said he was determined to make sure that agreement was reached at the eu summit next month .
he underlined that it was crucial that the eu break its current deadlock after french and dutch voters rejected the draft eu constitution in referenda in 2005 .
" i am convinced that europe can not remain at a standstill .
we can not remain in this relative paralysis , " said sarkozy .
" we have to find a way out of this impasse , " he added .
slimline treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy clearly wants to put france back at the heart of europe the french president would like to see the streamlined document including provision for a permanent eu presidency to replace the current rotating one , possibilities for " enhanced cooperation " between eu states and a move from unanimity to majority voting .
immigration issues should also be covered by the new treaty , he said .
a new eu rulebook is needed to ensure efficient and rapid decision-making in a bloc which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states over recent years .
the french president emphasised that the scaled-down treaty should be agreed by the member states ' parliaments rather than being put to the people .
during a debate about the constitutional crisis in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the concept of an " eu constitution " had put off many dutch voters who see the document as a threat to national sovereignty .
problematic symbol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is one of the dissenting voices in the debate " it is clear that the symbol of the constitution was an important reason for the no vote , " said balkenende .
he stressed the need for reform , but called for it to be achieved in small steps .
but some important european players reject the idea of scaling down the constitution .
italian prime minister romano prodi has attacked the idea of the french " mini-treaty " and threatened that a vanguard of european nations who want closer integration could go it alone .
germany , which currently holds the rotating six-month eu presidency , has also said repeatedly that it wants the " substance " of the constitution to be preserved and the charter of fundamental rights to be annexed to the new treaty .
chancellor angela merkel has made resurrecting the failed constitution a top priority .
at the eu summit in june she is expected to call on all governments to rally behind her proposals for a new " road map " for europe to be ratified before european parliament elections in summer 2009 . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant e.on drops bid for spanish utility ending a long battle , german energy giant e.on said monday it had abandoned its takeover bid for spanish power company endesa , but planned to buy assets from the group worth about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- .

peter danckert : the additional confessions did n't come as a surprise to me .
for quite some time i 've been aware that doping is widespread , not only in germany but also in the international cycling scene .
i expect more to come in the next few days and months .
i also think that the confessions are not going to stop at the german border .
what are the biggest challenges in the fight against doping ?
we are dealing with widespread doping in cycling and other olympic sports that are less in the public eye at the moment .
we are working with deficient analysis systems and the testing labs are lagging behind and trying very painstakingly , despite a lack of financial resources , to track down what the economy and the pharmaceutical industry have put on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping is not limited to cyclists it 's becoming more and more apparent to me , when i make an appeal for amnesty-like regulations , that there are large groups within the organized sport scene that do n't even want this , for reasons that i do n't understand .
there is a considerable lack of information concerning the extent of doping , the structures , and the participation of doctors , managers , trainers and possibly even sponsors .
the very first goal must be to gather a picture of the situation that is as comprehensive as possible .
for me , sanctions are the second priority .
i ca n't expect active athletes to commit social or professional suicide by handing in a confession - and i ca n't offer them anything for it either .
they need a second chance and they can only get one if they have the opportunity to explain themselves openly without having to fear sanctions .
some sports organizations , such as the german olympic sport association -lrb- dosb -rrb- , have said that sanctions are more effective than legal penalties .
why are sanctions less important for you ?
there have to be effective legal measure in place , on the one hand .
we 'll have them when the law that is now on the table is passed in the beginning of july , because then the possession of moderate amounts of doping substances will be punishable by law , which gives the authorities a new and more effective approach .
on the other hand , we need understanding on the part of the sports organization .
they have to recognize that their entire sanction system has not been particularly effective .
they 've continually had cases where the doping test results were positive only by coincidence .
and since the tests are n't very effective , the fact that there are relatively few positive tests is n't proof that doping does n't happen but that the doping investigation methods are n't effective .
are you satisfied with the new anti-doping law that is set to be passed in germany in early july ?
to be honest , it does n't totally fulfil my expectations .
i would have wanted more extensive provisions .
but that 's politics .
when you have a coalition partner , you have to discuss with the partner and reach a solution .
as the old saying goes , " politics is the art of the doable . "
we have a law underway that i believe will offer additional investigation approaches in the future .
the federal bureau of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- will take responsibility , the range of punishment will become broader , telephone surveillance may become possible , and maybe a leniency program as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , it has been difficult to legally implicate doctors involved in doping cases if the sport scene does its part as well , then the chances are good that the situation will improve .
what can the sport scene do ?
and how can the sport scene and the government work together ?
it 's my hope that , after the statements from four professional cyclists and two doctors in the past few days , the sport world has recognized that these are not isolated cases but that mass doping is now the order of the day .
these are not isolated cases , even looking beyond germany 's borders .
i was in rome recently and spoke with recognized doping experts who said that it 's also widespread in italy , not only in cycling but in other olympic sports as well .
there are considerable deficits in many areas that can only be corrected with the help of the sport world .
for example , we have to convince the sponsors to contribute one percent of their sponsoring funds - which in germany alone amount to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - to the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- so that more can be done for prevention , training checks , competition checks and doping analysis .
that 's where the sport world can get involved - but they have to want to .
in many cases , it 's not just the athletes themselves who are involved in a doping case , but also trainers , managers and even doctors .
to what extent should these people also be subject to penalties ?
a lot has been achieved through the amendment to the pharmaceutical laws , which defines the legal penalties that deal with doping .
it used to be the case that only the sale of illegal substances was punishable .
now , when the law is passed in early july , the possession of moderate amounts of illegal substances will also be punishable .

peter danckert : the additional confessions did n't come as a surprise to me .
for quite some time i 've been aware that doping is widespread , not only in germany but also in the international cycling scene .
i expect more to come in the next few days and months .
i also think that the confessions are not going to stop at the german border .
what are the biggest challenges in the fight against doping ?
we are dealing with widespread doping in cycling and other olympic sports that are less in the public eye at the moment .
we are working with deficient analysis systems and the testing labs are lagging behind and trying very painstakingly , despite a lack of financial resources , to track down what the economy and the pharmaceutical industry have put on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping is not limited to cyclists it 's becoming more and more apparent to me , when i make an appeal for amnesty-like regulations , that there are large groups within the organized sport scene that do n't even want this , for reasons that i do n't understand .
there is a considerable lack of information concerning the extent of doping , the structures , and the participation of doctors , managers , trainers and possibly even sponsors .
the very first goal must be to gather a picture of the situation that is as comprehensive as possible .
for me , sanctions are the second priority .
i ca n't expect active athletes to commit social or professional suicide by handing in a confession - and i ca n't offer them anything for it either .
they need a second chance and they can only get one if they have the opportunity to explain themselves openly without having to fear sanctions .
some sports organizations , such as the german olympic sport association -lrb- dosb -rrb- , have said that sanctions are more effective than legal penalties .
why are sanctions less important for you ?
there have to be effective legal measure in place , on the one hand .
we 'll have them when the law that is now on the table is passed in the beginning of july , because then the possession of moderate amounts of doping substances will be punishable by law , which gives the authorities a new and more effective approach .
on the other hand , we need understanding on the part of the sports organization .
they have to recognize that their entire sanction system has not been particularly effective .
they 've continually had cases where the doping test results were positive only by coincidence .
and since the tests are n't very effective , the fact that there are relatively few positive tests is n't proof that doping does n't happen but that the doping investigation methods are n't effective .
are you satisfied with the new anti-doping law that is set to be passed in germany in early july ?
to be honest , it does n't totally fulfil my expectations .
i would have wanted more extensive provisions .
but that 's politics .
when you have a coalition partner , you have to discuss with the partner and reach a solution .
as the old saying goes , " politics is the art of the doable . "
we have a law underway that i believe will offer additional investigation approaches in the future .
the federal bureau of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- will take responsibility , the range of punishment will become broader , telephone surveillance may become possible , and maybe a leniency program as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , it has been difficult to legally implicate doctors involved in doping cases if the sport scene does its part as well , then the chances are good that the situation will improve .
what can the sport scene do ?
and how can the sport scene and the government work together ?
it 's my hope that , after the statements from four professional cyclists and two doctors in the past few days , the sport world has recognized that these are not isolated cases but that mass doping is now the order of the day .
these are not isolated cases , even looking beyond germany 's borders .
i was in rome recently and spoke with recognized doping experts who said that it 's also widespread in italy , not only in cycling but in other olympic sports as well .
there are considerable deficits in many areas that can only be corrected with the help of the sport world .
for example , we have to convince the sponsors to contribute one percent of their sponsoring funds - which in germany alone amount to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - to the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- so that more can be done for prevention , training checks , competition checks and doping analysis .
that 's where the sport world can get involved - but they have to want to .
in many cases , it 's not just the athletes themselves who are involved in a doping case , but also trainers , managers and even doctors .
to what extent should these people also be subject to penalties ?
a lot has been achieved through the amendment to the pharmaceutical laws , which defines the legal penalties that deal with doping .
it used to be the case that only the sale of illegal substances was punishable .
now , when the law is passed in early july , the possession of moderate amounts of illegal substances will also be punishable .
for the police , the prosecutors and later for the courts , this is an additional and very effective way to fight doping .
it 's not only the athlete that is involved but also the trainers , the managers , the doctors and everyone surrounding the athlete that has been legally untouchable until now .
this will be different in the future and , with the federal bureau of criminal investigation , we have a very effective authority to take care of the job .

the deal would give e.on access to an electricity market which is growing at an annual rate of five to six percent , the company said in a written statement .
" the upcoming liberalization of russia 's wholesale electricity sector will create an attractive business environment for investment in electricity generation , " it added .
ambitious plans e.on said that its long-term goal was to build up a strong position in the rapidly growing industrial regions in the urals , western siberia , volga , as well as in central russia .
the new joint venture , which will be based in tyumen in western siberia , is also aiming to reinforce its market presence in the region by participating in the privatization of russian state power company tgk-10 .
sts is involved in both power production and distribution and supplies some 1.1 million gas and electricity customers in western siberia .
it plans to transfer some of its own generating capacity into the new joint venture , e.on said .
the german company has not revealed how much money it will be investing in its project .
the news comes shortly after e.on 's plans to takeover spain 's endesa failed at the beginning of april .
sector privatization e.on has been keen to gain access to the russian electricity market for some time , but the sector has remained firmly in state hands .
russia 's state-owned holding compay rao ues is now taking steps to liberalize the electricity market to respond to the growing demand for power .
the industry , according to e.on , will require annual investments of some 15 billion euros over the next 15 years .
this is not merely a matter of modernizing power plants and grids , but also building new plants .
e.on said by increasing the efficiency of russian power plants it will also be able to help improve the environment . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic eon is moving in on the russian energy market feedback send us an e-mail .

it was a triumphant finale to a season which started with the club being docked eight points for their involvement in italy 's match-fixing scandal .
only a successful appeal against an initial , heavier , penalty enabled milan to enter the champions league at all , and they were forced to begin their campaign in the final qualifying round .
defying the odds " it is the greatest victory we have had , " ac milan coach carlo ancelotti said .
" few believed we could do it , but we have actually done something extraordinary that very few people , perhaps nobody , expected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool supporters dreams crushed in athens on wednesday .
liverpool 's chances of pulling a repeat of their 2005 victory over ancelotti 's men were dealt a severe blow by milan 's opening goal : an andrea pirlo free-kick that beat jose reina with the help of a deflection off inzaghi 's shoulder .
the striker had no hesitation in claiming the credit for the goal .
" of course we worked on that in training and sometimes it comes off , " he said , apparently tongue-in-cheek .
liverpool bruised , but gracious liverpool boss rafael benitez was enraged by the scarcity of extra time , but played down his touchline explosion afterwards .
" i do n't want to use this as an excuse , " the spaniard said .
" we were playing well until we conceded the first goal , and they have players with the quality to make the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final in athens : liverpool started out strong , but could n't match filippo inzaghi 's double strike .
" we were controlling the game , going forward and creating chances but we conceded a bad goal at a bad time , " benitez said .
line up changes failed with just under an hour gone , benitez introduced harry kewell .
but he proved no more effective than the man he replaced , bolo zenden .
the manager rejected suggestions he should have been bolder and started with the australian winger rather than packing five men across his midfield .
" kewell could not play a long time , he was ten months without playing , " benitez said . " milan are well organized in defence and good on counter attack .
when you try to attack , you have to keep a balance and not leave big spaces behind .
when you lose the balance against them they just need one opportunity and they will kill you . "
lucky opening goal ancelotti acknowledged that milan 's opening goal had been the lucky break his side needed against opponents who posed them far more problems than manchester united had in the semi-final .
" liverpool did not let us play the way we wanted in the first half , " ancelotti said .
" our midfielders were under pressure and we did not get the ball to kaka and clarence seedorf as much as we wanted . "
but he said this was a tough team and they had managed a difficult situation quite well . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milan face two opponents in liverpool and foolish revenge ac milan have waited two years to avenge the 2005 champions league final defeat to liverpool .

" a simplified treaty is the only way forwards , " sarkozy told reporters at the joint press conference .
on his second foreign trip after his inauguration last week , the french leader said he was determined to make sure that agreement was reached at the eu summit next month .
he underlined that it was crucial that the eu break its current deadlock after french and dutch voters rejected the draft eu constitution in referenda in 2005 .
" i am convinced that europe can not remain at a standstill .
we can not remain in this relative paralysis , " said sarkozy .
" we have to find a way out of this impasse , " he added .
slimline treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy clearly wants to put france back at the heart of europe the french president would like to see the streamlined document including provision for a permanent eu presidency to replace the current rotating one , possibilities for " enhanced cooperation " between eu states and a move from unanimity to majority voting .
immigration issues should also be covered by the new treaty , he said .
a new eu rulebook is needed to ensure efficient and rapid decision-making in a bloc which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states over recent years .
the french president emphasised that the scaled-down treaty should be agreed by the member states ' parliaments rather than being put to the people .
during a debate about the constitutional crisis in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the concept of an " eu constitution " had put off many dutch voters who see the document as a threat to national sovereignty .
problematic symbol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is one of the dissenting voices in the debate " it is clear that the symbol of the constitution was an important reason for the no vote , " said balkenende .

" a simplified treaty is the only way forwards , " sarkozy told reporters at the joint press conference .
on his second foreign trip after his inauguration last week , the french leader said he was determined to make sure that agreement was reached at the eu summit next month .
he underlined that it was crucial that the eu break its current deadlock after french and dutch voters rejected the draft eu constitution in referenda in 2005 .

can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .
today our work is more complex and that makes it more difficult .
the suffering is not as striking and not as visible as it was then , but it 's nevertheless just as big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey is on his second mission in darfur chancellor angela merkel was critical this week at the africa summit and said that african states should guarantee that aid actually arrives where it 's needed .
what 's your opinion about this ?
the criticism is valid .
aid is often not given where it 's needed most but where it brings the most political gain .
doctors without borders is active where medical assistance is needed the most .
for this reason , we 're also present in the places where other organizations do n't go .
the darfur conflict will be discussed this week by the un human rights council and again in june at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
what are your expectations for these conferences ?
i 'm hopeful but i do n't have any big expectations .
aside from the meetings , it is my wish that the people wo n't have to live in camps any longer but can live at home and at peace with each other , and that they really have all the medical assistance that they need .
but that 's an optimistic wish .
it 's important that the people here are n't forgotten in the near future , which unfortunately happens often when a conflict drags on for years .
matthias hrubey is a general practitioner and the associate national coordinator for doctors without borders in darfur .
along with 100 international and more than 2,000 local colleagues , he provides medical attention to those who need it .

" it is important that the g8 develops a common understand of how climate change can be tackled and what agreements can be made for the period beyond 2012 , " said merkel , referring to the year when the kyoto protocol expires .
merkel pessimistic about results the chancellor added , however , that she did n't expect concrete results to be achieved during the meeting of the group of eight industrialized countries on june 6-8 in the northern german city of heiligendamm .
" i can say quite openly that i do n't know if we will succeed in that at heiligendamm , " said merkel in her speech .
" but for me it is clear that the big developed nations must take the lead on this issue if we are to have a change at fighting climate change . "

germany wants code of conduct chancellor merkel on thursday also named hedge-fund transparency as a priority on the g8 agenda .
hedge-funds are an aggressive and risky investment tool estimated to incorporate some 1.5 trillion dollars world-wide .
transparency in the hedge-fund sector is " urgently necessary " to boost " confidence in the economy , " said the chancellor , adding that germany supports the development of an official code of conduct for the branch .
resistance to regulations in the hedge-fund sector has come from the us and britain , where most of the world 's 9,000 hedge-funds are located .
the chancellor acknowledged that steps had been made at the meeting of g8 finance ministers last weekend in potsdam , but , as with the climate change discussion , she also conceded that the negotiation process would need to be continued after the g8 summit .

" we will keep these promises , " she said .
" the time has come to implement and our credibility is at stake . "
merkel announced that the increase in development aid could be financed with the fees the state exacts from companies for disposing of contaminating waste .
leaders from algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria , senegal and south africa have been invited to join the g8 member states as guests at the conference .
merkel defends police action in addition , merkel addressed g8 protesters .
protest must be peaceful , she said , " those who resort to violence make dialogue impossible . "
at the same time , the chancellor defended the security measures that have been implemented in germany in the run-up to the summit .

" it is important that the g8 develops a common understand of how climate change can be tackled and what agreements can be made for the period beyond 2012 , " said merkel , referring to the year when the kyoto protocol expires .
merkel pessimistic about results the chancellor added , however , that she did n't expect concrete results to be achieved during the meeting of the group of eight industrialized countries on june 6-8 in the northern german city of heiligendamm .
" i can say quite openly that i do n't know if we will succeed in that at heiligendamm , " said merkel in her speech .
" but for me it is clear that the big developed nations must take the lead on this issue if we are to have a change at fighting climate change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 has to decide on kyoto 's successor environmental minister sigmar gabriel from the social democratic party said earlier this week in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf that said talks on climate change would be " super difficult " because of the position of the us .
" we have to put the pressure on , " he added .
germany wants code of conduct chancellor merkel on thursday also named hedge-fund transparency as a priority on the g8 agenda .
hedge-funds are an aggressive and risky investment tool estimated to incorporate some 1.5 trillion dollars world-wide .
transparency in the hedge-fund sector is " urgently necessary " to boost " confidence in the economy , " said the chancellor , adding that germany supports the development of an official code of conduct for the branch .
resistance to regulations in the hedge-fund sector has come from the us and britain , where most of the world 's 9,000 hedge-funds are located .
the chancellor acknowledged that steps had been made at the meeting of g8 finance ministers last weekend in potsdam , but , as with the climate change discussion , she also conceded that the negotiation process would need to be continued after the g8 summit .
focus on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono -lrb- left -rrb- and bob geldof have criticized the g8 development aid for africa would be another central discussion topic at the summit , said merkel , affirming that the g8 countries would honor the promises for development aid increases that they had made at their 2005 summit .
" we will keep these promises , " she said .
" the time has come to implement and our credibility is at stake . "
merkel announced that the increase in development aid could be financed with the fees the state exacts from companies for disposing of contaminating waste .
leaders from algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria , senegal and south africa have been invited to join the g8 member states as guests at the conference .
merkel defends police action in addition , merkel addressed g8 protesters .
protest must be peaceful , she said , " those who resort to violence make dialogue impossible . "
at the same time , the chancellor defended the security measures that have been implemented in germany in the run-up to the summit .
police have recently come under fire for raiding the offices of left-wing groups and taking body scent samples to be used in the event of a crime .

" since then , for the past eleven years , i have always denied doping .
i lied , and i apologize for this , " zabel said with reddened eyes . doping doctors fired the confessions came a day after the university doctors andreas schmid and lothar heinrich admitted to epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at team telekom . " i admit that , upon request , i made doping substances , especially epo , available to certain riders since mid-1990s , " schmid said in his statement .

can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .
today our work is more complex and that makes it more difficult .
the suffering is not as striking and not as visible as it was then , but it 's nevertheless just as big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey is on his second mission in darfur chancellor angela merkel was critical this week at the africa summit and said that african states should guarantee that aid actually arrives where it 's needed .
what 's your opinion about this ?
the criticism is valid .
aid is often not given where it 's needed most but where it brings the most political gain .
doctors without borders is active where medical assistance is needed the most .
for this reason , we 're also present in the places where other organizations do n't go .
the darfur conflict will be discussed this week by the un human rights council and again in june at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
what are your expectations for these conferences ?
i 'm hopeful but i do n't have any big expectations .
aside from the meetings , it is my wish that the people wo n't have to live in camps any longer but can live at home and at peace with each other , and that they really have all the medical assistance that they need .
but that 's an optimistic wish .
it 's important that the people here are n't forgotten in the near future , which unfortunately happens often when a conflict drags on for years .
matthias hrubey is a general practitioner and the associate national coordinator for doctors without borders in darfur .
along with 100 international and more than 2,000 local colleagues , he provides medical attention to those who need it .

can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .

" it is important that the g8 develops a common understand of how climate change can be tackled and what agreements can be made for the period beyond 2012 , " said merkel , referring to the year when the kyoto protocol expires .
merkel pessimistic about results the chancellor added , however , that she did n't expect concrete results to be achieved during the meeting of the group of eight industrialized countries on june 6-8 in the northern german city of heiligendamm .
" i can say quite openly that i do n't know if we will succeed in that at heiligendamm , " said merkel in her speech .
" but for me it is clear that the big developed nations must take the lead on this issue if we are to have a change at fighting climate change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 has to decide on kyoto 's successor environmental minister sigmar gabriel from the social democratic party said earlier this week in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf that said talks on climate change would be " super difficult " because of the position of the us .
" we have to put the pressure on , " he added .
germany wants code of conduct chancellor merkel on thursday also named hedge-fund transparency as a priority on the g8 agenda .
hedge-funds are an aggressive and risky investment tool estimated to incorporate some 1.5 trillion dollars world-wide .
transparency in the hedge-fund sector is " urgently necessary " to boost " confidence in the economy , " said the chancellor , adding that germany supports the development of an official code of conduct for the branch .
resistance to regulations in the hedge-fund sector has come from the us and britain , where most of the world 's 9,000 hedge-funds are located .
the chancellor acknowledged that steps had been made at the meeting of g8 finance ministers last weekend in potsdam , but , as with the climate change discussion , she also conceded that the negotiation process would need to be continued after the g8 summit .
focus on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono -lrb- left -rrb- and bob geldof have criticized the g8 development aid for africa would be another central discussion topic at the summit , said merkel , affirming that the g8 countries would honor the promises for development aid increases that they had made at their 2005 summit .
" we will keep these promises , " she said .
" the time has come to implement and our credibility is at stake . "
merkel announced that the increase in development aid could be financed with the fees the state exacts from companies for disposing of contaminating waste .
leaders from algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria , senegal and south africa have been invited to join the g8 member states as guests at the conference .
merkel defends police action in addition , merkel addressed g8 protesters .
protest must be peaceful , she said , " those who resort to violence make dialogue impossible . "
at the same time , the chancellor defended the security measures that have been implemented in germany in the run-up to the summit .
police have recently come under fire for raiding the offices of left-wing groups and taking body scent samples to be used in the event of a crime .

in an interview , the head of the stasi museum in leipzig explains why the issue is so emotive . tobias hollitzer is the head of the stasi " runde ecke " museum in the eastern german city of leipzig .
a row of sealed jars , each containing a seemingly innocuous yellow dust cloth , forms part of the museum 's permanent exhibition .
but these jars were part of the east german secret police 's collection of scent samples used to keep track of dissidents . hollitzer talked to dw-world.de about the stasi 's collection of people 's smells and what he thinks of law enforcement using the method today . dw-world.de : mr. hollitzer , the east german secret police , the stasi , collected scent samples .
why ? the stasi had a whole range of methods and means to try to track down people who said or did anything critical of the east german communist regime . collecting scent samples was used to try to identify those , for example , who had distributed flyers or who wrote critical graffiti . how did the stasi collect these samples ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained dogs are used to identify people 's smells when they found a piece of graffiti or a flyer then they took a dust cloth , which was usually yellow , and left it for a while lying next to the flyers covered by a protective piece of aluminum foil and then they had their sample .
the cloth was then sealed in a pickling jar and stored .
if the stasi later came across a suspect in the process of the investigation , they tried to get a sample from this person as well - of course , secretly .
a trained dog was given the two smells , and if they matched , the stasi had a concrete name . how did the stasi collected samples from people secretly ? they would often invite someone in for a talk with the police or other officials , for example , and undercover stasi officers pretending to be police officers or an administrative person were usually present at this meeting .
and while the person sat on the chair in the office , they would be , without knowing it , impregnating a yellow cloth hidden under the seat .
when this fictive visit was over , the stasi officer would then put the cloth in the pickle jar - and they had their sample . was scent sampling a method developed by the stasi ? no , it 's a well-known police method used in criminal investigations , but even in the gdr it was n't allowed to be admitted as evidence and that 's why the samples were often collected secretly instead of openly .
the problem is not with scent profiling as such , but rather with collecting scents as a precautionary measure in case they can eventually be used in the future .
this is what the stasi did - they had a giant scent register of dissidents .
they really tried to have a sample of everyone who potentially could have said something critical of the state how many samples are we talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi collected as much information as possible about people i 'm not sure of concrete numbers because in 1989 -lrb- when the berlin wall fell -rrb- the samples were destroyed and they are n't listed in the stasi files .
but just in the leipzig area , it would have certainly been several thousand . what do you think of current reports that german police have collected scent samples from activists who could be involved in violence in the lead-up to the g8 summit ? i think it is important to be very clear that the danger of the method is using it without having a concrete crime .
collecting samples on the suspicion that people could protest or offend in the future clearly harks back to stasi times , when security officials operated without any type of state limitation . in these times of the so-called war on terror , do you think the german state is going too far in its security activities ? the state has being going too far for a very long time - it 's just that now the issues surrounding the collection of scent samples are making this evident because here in germany , the stasi are so strongly associated with this particular method . if you take a look at what has happened here since sept 11. with new security laws , then we have to ask the question of how much freedom we want to sacrifice in the name of security .
information such as telephone and internet data now has to be saved for at least six months .

a row of sealed jars , each containing a seemingly innocuous yellow dust cloth , forms part of the museum 's permanent exhibition .
but these jars were part of the east german secret police 's collection of scent samples used to keep track of dissidents . hollitzer talked to dw-world.de about the stasi 's collection of people 's smells and what he thinks of law enforcement using the method today . dw-world.de : mr. hollitzer , the east german secret police , the stasi , collected scent samples .
why ? the stasi had a whole range of methods and means to try to track down people who said or did anything critical of the east german communist regime . collecting scent samples was used to try to identify those , for example , who had distributed flyers or who wrote critical graffiti . how did the stasi collect these samples ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained dogs are used to identify people 's smells when they found a piece of graffiti or a flyer then they took a dust cloth , which was usually yellow , and left it for a while lying next to the flyers covered by a protective piece of aluminum foil and then they had their sample .
the cloth was then sealed in a pickling jar and stored .
if the stasi later came across a suspect in the process of the investigation , they tried to get a sample from this person as well - of course , secretly .
a trained dog was given the two smells , and if they matched , the stasi had a concrete name . how did the stasi collected samples from people secretly ? they would often invite someone in for a talk with the police or other officials , for example , and undercover stasi officers pretending to be police officers or an administrative person were usually present at this meeting .
and while the person sat on the chair in the office , they would be , without knowing it , impregnating a yellow cloth hidden under the seat .
when this fictive visit was over , the stasi officer would then put the cloth in the pickle jar - and they had their sample . was scent sampling a method developed by the stasi ? no , it 's a well-known police method used in criminal investigations , but even in the gdr it was n't allowed to be admitted as evidence and that 's why the samples were often collected secretly instead of openly .
the problem is not with scent profiling as such , but rather with collecting scents as a precautionary measure in case they can eventually be used in the future .
this is what the stasi did - they had a giant scent register of dissidents .
they really tried to have a sample of everyone who potentially could have said something critical of the state how many samples are we talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi collected as much information as possible about people i 'm not sure of concrete numbers because in 1989 -lrb- when the berlin wall fell -rrb- the samples were destroyed and they are n't listed in the stasi files .
but just in the leipzig area , it would have certainly been several thousand . what do you think of current reports that german police have collected scent samples from activists who could be involved in violence in the lead-up to the g8 summit ? i think it is important to be very clear that the danger of the method is using it without having a concrete crime .
collecting samples on the suspicion that people could protest or offend in the future clearly harks back to stasi times , when security officials operated without any type of state limitation . in these times of the so-called war on terror , do you think the german state is going too far in its security activities ? the state has being going too far for a very long time - it 's just that now the issues surrounding the collection of scent samples are making this evident because here in germany , the stasi are so strongly associated with this particular method . if you take a look at what has happened here since sept 11. with new security laws , then we have to ask the question of how much freedom we want to sacrifice in the name of security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.05.2007 rich g8 countries need to fulfill promises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is time to hold governments accountable , says jeffrey sachs jeffrey sachs , director of the earth institute at columbia university and special advisor to un secretary general ban ki-moon , outlines what action the g8 must take to end poverty and retain credibility . the millennium development goals are the world ’ s agreed goals to cut poverty , hunger , and disease . they were established in 2000 , with targets for 2015 . we are at the half-way point to meet the goals .
so far , the rich g8 countries are not meeting their part of the bargain , despite endless words from the rich countries about increasing their aid to the poor countries . when new donor countries such as china enter the scene , the us and europe tend to complain , as if their monopoly over low-income africa and asia is being broken . the political standing of the g8 in the world will plummet if it is unable or unwilling to follow through on its word . though the g8 promised to double aid to africa at the 2005 gleneagles summit , there is no plan on how to do so . for the first year after gleneagles , the reported aid numbers were padded by misleading accounting on debt cancellation operations . with those debt cancellation operations largely completed , the data are now revealing the stark truth . development aid to africa , and to poor countries more generally , is stagnant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles 2005 - it is now time to fulfil those promises specifically , between 2005 and 2006 , overall aid to africa , excluding debt cancellation operations , showed a meager increase of 2 percent , far off track from a path of doubling aid . total official development assistance to all recipient countries , net of debt cancellation , actually declined by 2 percent between 2005 and 2006 . even the world bank , usually taking the donors ’ point of view , recently acknowledged that except for debt cancellation , “ promises of scaled up aid have not been delivered . ” all of this would seem to be insurmountable if the basic economics were not so clear . we are not talking about an unachievable amount of money from the rich countries . indeed what we are talking about is minuscule . the g8 , representing nearly 1 billion people in high-income countries , has promised to increase aid to africa from $ 25 billion in 2004 to $ 50 billion in 2010 . that $ 25 billion is less than one-tenth of one percent of the income of the rich donor world ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the christmas bonuses this year on wall street amounted to $ 24 billion " to put it in perspective , the christmas bonuses this year on wall street - just the bonuses - amounted to $ 24 billion ! the spending on the war in iraq , which accomplishes nothing but violence , is more than $ 100 billion per year . the g8 could easily honor its commitments , if the rich countries had the slightest concern to do so . to salvage the g8 ’ s dwindling credibility , here is what needs to be done . first , the g8 needs to make crystal clear that it will honor its commitment to increase aid to africa by $ 25 billion per year , so that total aid reaches $ 50 billion per year .
that way , the cynics within the g8 governments can understand their assignments . second , the g8 needs to put forward a plan of action . the lack of specific commitments by specific countries is shocking , and a display of governance at its poorest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " progress in the fight against poverty will contribute not only to survival and human dignity , but also to peace " third , the recipient countries need to be told of the year-to-year increases in aid that they can expect , so that they can plan ahead to the year 2010 . the increased aid should be directed at building roads , power grids , schools , and clinics , and at training teachers , doctors , and community health workers . yet all of that investment requires plans and years of implementation . aid needs to be committed in clear terms over a period of several years , so that recipient countries can use it sensibly and accountably . african countries have already identified their high-priority investments in health , education , agriculture , and infrastructure -lrb- including roads , power , and internet connectivity -rrb- . these investments could be increased systematically during the period from now until 2015 , in order to enable those countries to achieve the millennium development goals . it ’ s time for the rich countries to stop giving lectures to the poor , and instead to follow through on their own words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey sachs progress in the fight against poverty will contribute not only to survival and human dignity , but also to peace . it is time , therefore , to hold our governments accountable for what they have pledged but not delivered . professor jeffrey sachs is director of the earth institute at columbia university and special advisor to un secretary general ban ki-moon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.05.2007 rich g8 countries need to fulfill promises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is time to hold governments accountable , says jeffrey sachs jeffrey sachs , director of the earth institute at columbia university and special advisor to un secretary general ban ki-moon , outlines what action the g8 must take to end poverty and retain credibility . the millennium development goals are the world ’ s agreed goals to cut poverty , hunger , and disease . they were established in 2000 , with targets for 2015 . we are at the half-way point to meet the goals .
so far , the rich g8 countries are not meeting their part of the bargain , despite endless words from the rich countries about increasing their aid to the poor countries . when new donor countries such as china enter the scene , the us and europe tend to complain , as if their monopoly over low-income africa and asia is being broken . the political standing of the g8 in the world will plummet if it is unable or unwilling to follow through on its word . though the g8 promised to double aid to africa at the 2005 gleneagles summit , there is no plan on how to do so . for the first year after gleneagles , the reported aid numbers were padded by misleading accounting on debt cancellation operations . with those debt cancellation operations largely completed , the data are now revealing the stark truth . development aid to africa , and to poor countries more generally , is stagnant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles 2005 - it is now time to fulfil those promises specifically , between 2005 and 2006 , overall aid to africa , excluding debt cancellation operations , showed a meager increase of 2 percent , far off track from a path of doubling aid . total official development assistance to all recipient countries , net of debt cancellation , actually declined by 2 percent between 2005 and 2006 . even the world bank , usually taking the donors ’ point of view , recently acknowledged that except for debt cancellation , “ promises of scaled up aid have not been delivered . ” all of this would seem to be insurmountable if the basic economics were not so clear . we are not talking about an unachievable amount of money from the rich countries . indeed what we are talking about is minuscule . the g8 , representing nearly 1 billion people in high-income countries , has promised to increase aid to africa from $ 25 billion in 2004 to $ 50 billion in 2010 . that $ 25 billion is less than one-tenth of one percent of the income of the rich donor world ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the christmas bonuses this year on wall street amounted to $ 24 billion " to put it in perspective , the christmas bonuses this year on wall street - just the bonuses - amounted to $ 24 billion ! the spending on the war in iraq , which accomplishes nothing but violence , is more than $ 100 billion per year . the g8 could easily honor its commitments , if the rich countries had the slightest concern to do so . to salvage the g8 ’ s dwindling credibility , here is what needs to be done . first , the g8 needs to make crystal clear that it will honor its commitment to increase aid to africa by $ 25 billion per year , so that total aid reaches $ 50 billion per year .
that way , the cynics within the g8 governments can understand their assignments . second , the g8 needs to put forward a plan of action . the lack of specific commitments by specific countries is shocking , and a display of governance at its poorest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " progress in the fight against poverty will contribute not only to survival and human dignity , but also to peace " third , the recipient countries need to be told of the year-to-year increases in aid that they can expect , so that they can plan ahead to the year 2010 . the increased aid should be directed at building roads , power grids , schools , and clinics , and at training teachers , doctors , and community health workers . yet all of that investment requires plans and years of implementation . aid needs to be committed in clear terms over a period of several years , so that recipient countries can use it sensibly and accountably . african countries have already identified their high-priority investments in health , education , agriculture , and infrastructure -lrb- including roads , power , and internet connectivity -rrb- . these investments could be increased systematically during the period from now until 2015 , in order to enable those countries to achieve the millennium development goals . it ’ s time for the rich countries to stop giving lectures to the poor , and instead to follow through on their own words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey sachs progress in the fight against poverty will contribute not only to survival and human dignity , but also to peace . it is time , therefore , to hold our governments accountable for what they have pledged but not delivered . professor jeffrey sachs is director of the earth institute at columbia university and special advisor to un secretary general ban ki-moon .

" the presidency urgently appeals to iran to reconsider its policy and to comply with the demands of the international community , " the eu presidency said in statement . it said the european union has taken note of the latest report of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on iran with " great concern . " in the report , iaea director mohamed elbaradei accused iran of failing to cooperate with his agency 's inspectors and said that he agreed with us assessments that iran could acquire nuclear weapons within the next decade . " in other words three to eight years from now , " he said . the eu said the report confirmed that iran has flouted two recent un resolutions demanding that the islamic republic suspend uranium enrichment , which is at the heart of its standoff with the west . " iran has disregarded these appeals and continued to drive forward its nuclear program as well as restricting its cooperation with the iaea . " eu urges tehran to prove " peaceful " program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's ferrero-waldner , steinmeier and solana the eu presidency called on tehran to cooperate with iaea inspectors in order to convince the world of its claims that its nuclear program is of " an exclusively peaceful nature . " it said iran should use talks between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator on may 31 to signal a change in policy that will allow full negotiations to resolve the nuclear standoff to resume . iran 's hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad reacted defiantly to the report and to threats of fresh sanctions from the west , saying iran would not retreat " a single step " on its nuclear program . meanwhile , france and the united states warned that the un security council would have to discuss a third package of sanctions measures against iran unless it made a major about-turn by freezing sensitive nuclear work . but president mahmoud ahmadinejad indicated the islamic republic was in no mood to cave into the demands of the west . " the enemies aim to prevent us from using peaceful nuclear technology , not for scientific reasons but because they want to eradicate the roots of the principles of the islamic republic , " he said on thursday , according to the isna news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- r -rrb- is known for his fiery anti-western speeches " therefore if we stop , even for a moment , they will achieve their aims , " he told a group of elite revolutionary guards commanders . ahmadinejad made the comments a day after the international atomic energy agency said that iran was making substantial advances in uranium enrichment in defiance of world demands to stop . new sanctions threat the iaea board will review its assessement in june , paving the way for a security council meeting on iran that could agree new sanctions in addition to existing measures against iran 's nuclear and ballistics industries . new french foreign minister bernard kouchner said paris backed the rapid adoption of " new sanctions " against iran if it maintains its refusal . " if that is the case , i hope that we can rapidly adopt new sanctions that will show iran that the path it has chosen is unacceptable and will only drive it into growing isolation , " said kouchner , who was on a visit to lebanon . us warning the united states said that unless iran agreed to a longstanding offer to suspend sensitive nuclear work as a prelude to negotiations , there was no other option than a drive for further sanctions . " iran is once again thumbing its nose at the international community , " us under secretary of state nicholas burns said after the iaea report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran inaugurated two minor plants at its bushehr nuclear reactor in april " should it turn down the offer again , i would think what you 'd see is a strong drive " by the us security council for a third sanctions resolution . at issue is iran 's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment , a process that can be used both to make nuclear fuel and highly enriched uranium for the explosive core of an atomic bomb . the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons but the islamic republic insists it just wants to generate energy for a growing population . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran expects " new ideas " from eu to end nuclear standoff iran 's nuclear negotiator ali larijani said wednesday that he expected new ideas from eu foreign policy chief javier solana on breaking the standoff over tehran 's disputed nuclear program .

in an interview , the head of the stasi museum in leipzig explains why the issue is so emotive . tobias hollitzer is the head of the stasi " runde ecke " museum in the eastern german city of leipzig .
a row of sealed jars , each containing a seemingly innocuous yellow dust cloth , forms part of the museum 's permanent exhibition .
but these jars were part of the east german secret police 's collection of scent samples used to keep track of dissidents . hollitzer talked to dw-world.de about the stasi 's collection of people 's smells and what he thinks of law enforcement using the method today . dw-world.de : mr. hollitzer , the east german secret police , the stasi , collected scent samples .
why ? the stasi had a whole range of methods and means to try to track down people who said or did anything critical of the east german communist regime . collecting scent samples was used to try to identify those , for example , who had distributed flyers or who wrote critical graffiti . how did the stasi collect these samples ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained dogs are used to identify people 's smells when they found a piece of graffiti or a flyer then they took a dust cloth , which was usually yellow , and left it for a while lying next to the flyers covered by a protective piece of aluminum foil and then they had their sample .
the cloth was then sealed in a pickling jar and stored .
if the stasi later came across a suspect in the process of the investigation , they tried to get a sample from this person as well - of course , secretly .
a trained dog was given the two smells , and if they matched , the stasi had a concrete name . how did the stasi collected samples from people secretly ? they would often invite someone in for a talk with the police or other officials , for example , and undercover stasi officers pretending to be police officers or an administrative person were usually present at this meeting .
and while the person sat on the chair in the office , they would be , without knowing it , impregnating a yellow cloth hidden under the seat .
when this fictive visit was over , the stasi officer would then put the cloth in the pickle jar - and they had their sample . was scent sampling a method developed by the stasi ? no , it 's a well-known police method used in criminal investigations , but even in the gdr it was n't allowed to be admitted as evidence and that 's why the samples were often collected secretly instead of openly .
the problem is not with scent profiling as such , but rather with collecting scents as a precautionary measure in case they can eventually be used in the future .
this is what the stasi did - they had a giant scent register of dissidents .
they really tried to have a sample of everyone who potentially could have said something critical of the state how many samples are we talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi collected as much information as possible about people i 'm not sure of concrete numbers because in 1989 -lrb- when the berlin wall fell -rrb- the samples were destroyed and they are n't listed in the stasi files .
but just in the leipzig area , it would have certainly been several thousand . what do you think of current reports that german police have collected scent samples from activists who could be involved in violence in the lead-up to the g8 summit ? i think it is important to be very clear that the danger of the method is using it without having a concrete crime .
collecting samples on the suspicion that people could protest or offend in the future clearly harks back to stasi times , when security officials operated without any type of state limitation . in these times of the so-called war on terror , do you think the german state is going too far in its security activities ? the state has being going too far for a very long time - it 's just that now the issues surrounding the collection of scent samples are making this evident because here in germany , the stasi are so strongly associated with this particular method . if you take a look at what has happened here since sept 11. with new security laws , then we have to ask the question of how much freedom we want to sacrifice in the name of security .
information such as telephone and internet data now has to be saved for at least six months .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble is calling for authorities to have access to road toll data , and it is clear that we are on the way to becoming a surveillance state . kate hairsine interviewed tobis hollitzer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police collect scent samples of g8 protesters german police have collected body scent samples of left-wing activists in the lead up to the g8 summit .

peter danckert : the additional confessions did n't come as a surprise to me .
for quite some time i 've been aware that doping is widespread , not only in germany but also in the international cycling scene .
i expect more to come in the next few days and months .
i also think that the confessions are not going to stop at the german border .
what are the biggest challenges in the fight against doping ?
we are dealing with widespread doping in cycling and other olympic sports that are less in the public eye at the moment .
we are working with deficient analysis systems and the testing labs are lagging behind and trying very painstakingly , despite a lack of financial resources , to track down what the economy and the pharmaceutical industry have put on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping is not limited to cyclists it 's becoming more and more apparent to me , when i make an appeal for amnesty-like regulations , that there are large groups within the organized sport scene that do n't even want this , for reasons that i do n't understand .
there is a considerable lack of information concerning the extent of doping , the structures , and the participation of doctors , managers , trainers and possibly even sponsors .
the very first goal must be to gather a picture of the situation that is as comprehensive as possible .
for me , sanctions are the second priority .
i ca n't expect active athletes to commit social or professional suicide by handing in a confession - and i ca n't offer them anything for it either .
they need a second chance and they can only get one if they have the opportunity to explain themselves openly without having to fear sanctions .
some sports organizations , such as the german olympic sport association -lrb- dosb -rrb- , have said that sanctions are more effective than legal penalties .
why are sanctions less important for you ?
there have to be effective legal measure in place , on the one hand .
we 'll have them when the law that is now on the table is passed in the beginning of july , because then the possession of moderate amounts of doping substances will be punishable by law , which gives the authorities a new and more effective approach .
on the other hand , we need understanding on the part of the sports organization .
they have to recognize that their entire sanction system has not been particularly effective .
they 've continually had cases where the doping test results were positive only by coincidence .
and since the tests are n't very effective , the fact that there are relatively few positive tests is n't proof that doping does n't happen but that the doping investigation methods are n't effective .
are you satisfied with the new anti-doping law that is set to be passed in germany in early july ?
to be honest , it does n't totally fulfil my expectations .
i would have wanted more extensive provisions .
but that 's politics .
when you have a coalition partner , you have to discuss with the partner and reach a solution .
as the old saying goes , " politics is the art of the doable . "
we have a law underway that i believe will offer additional investigation approaches in the future .
the federal bureau of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- will take responsibility , the range of punishment will become broader , telephone surveillance may become possible , and maybe a leniency program as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , it has been difficult to legally implicate doctors involved in doping cases if the sport scene does its part as well , then the chances are good that the situation will improve .
what can the sport scene do ?
and how can the sport scene and the government work together ?
it 's my hope that , after the statements from four professional cyclists and two doctors in the past few days , the sport world has recognized that these are not isolated cases but that mass doping is now the order of the day .
these are not isolated cases , even looking beyond germany 's borders .
i was in rome recently and spoke with recognized doping experts who said that it 's also widespread in italy , not only in cycling but in other olympic sports as well .
there are considerable deficits in many areas that can only be corrected with the help of the sport world .
for example , we have to convince the sponsors to contribute one percent of their sponsoring funds - which in germany alone amount to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - to the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- so that more can be done for prevention , training checks , competition checks and doping analysis .
that 's where the sport world can get involved - but they have to want to .
in many cases , it 's not just the athletes themselves who are involved in a doping case , but also trainers , managers and even doctors .
to what extent should these people also be subject to penalties ?
a lot has been achieved through the amendment to the pharmaceutical laws , which defines the legal penalties that deal with doping .
it used to be the case that only the sale of illegal substances was punishable .
now , when the law is passed in early july , the possession of moderate amounts of illegal substances will also be punishable .
for the police , the prosecutors and later for the courts , this is an additional and very effective way to fight doping .
it 's not only the athlete that is involved but also the trainers , the managers , the doctors and everyone surrounding the athlete that has been legally untouchable until now .
this will be different in the future and , with the federal bureau of criminal investigation , we have a very effective authority to take care of the job .

for example , we have to convince the sponsors to contribute one percent of their sponsoring funds - which in germany alone amount to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - to the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- so that more can be done for prevention , training checks , competition checks and doping analysis .
that 's where the sport world can get involved - but they have to want to .
in many cases , it 's not just the athletes themselves who are involved in a doping case , but also trainers , managers and even doctors .
to what extent should these people also be subject to penalties ?
a lot has been achieved through the amendment to the pharmaceutical laws , which defines the legal penalties that deal with doping .
it used to be the case that only the sale of illegal substances was punishable .
now , when the law is passed in early july , the possession of moderate amounts of illegal substances will also be punishable .
for the police , the prosecutors and later for the courts , this is an additional and very effective way to fight doping .
it 's not only the athlete that is involved but also the trainers , the managers , the doctors and everyone surrounding the athlete that has been legally untouchable until now .
this will be different in the future and , with the federal bureau of criminal investigation , we have a very effective authority to take care of the job .

can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .
today our work is more complex and that makes it more difficult .
the suffering is not as striking and not as visible as it was then , but it 's nevertheless just as big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey is on his second mission in darfur chancellor angela merkel was critical this week at the africa summit and said that african states should guarantee that aid actually arrives where it 's needed .
what 's your opinion about this ?
the criticism is valid .
aid is often not given where it 's needed most but where it brings the most political gain .
doctors without borders is active where medical assistance is needed the most .
for this reason , we 're also present in the places where other organizations do n't go .
the darfur conflict will be discussed this week by the un human rights council and again in june at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
what are your expectations for these conferences ?
i 'm hopeful but i do n't have any big expectations .
aside from the meetings , it is my wish that the people wo n't have to live in camps any longer but can live at home and at peace with each other , and that they really have all the medical assistance that they need .
but that 's an optimistic wish .
it 's important that the people here are n't forgotten in the near future , which unfortunately happens often when a conflict drags on for years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 24.05.2007 germany , eu urges belligerent iran to rethink nuclear program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has been the main negotiating power in the iranian nuclear stand-off the german presidency of the eu on thursday urged iran to rethink its nuclear program after the un atomic watchdog warned that tehran could acquire nuclear weapons within three to eight years . " the presidency urgently appeals to iran to reconsider its policy and to comply with the demands of the international community , " the eu presidency said in statement . it said the european union has taken note of the latest report of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on iran with " great concern . " in the report , iaea director mohamed elbaradei accused iran of failing to cooperate with his agency 's inspectors and said that he agreed with us assessments that iran could acquire nuclear weapons within the next decade . " in other words three to eight years from now , " he said . the eu said the report confirmed that iran has flouted two recent un resolutions demanding that the islamic republic suspend uranium enrichment , which is at the heart of its standoff with the west . " iran has disregarded these appeals and continued to drive forward its nuclear program as well as restricting its cooperation with the iaea . " eu urges tehran to prove " peaceful " program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's ferrero-waldner , steinmeier and solana the eu presidency called on tehran to cooperate with iaea inspectors in order to convince the world of its claims that its nuclear program is of " an exclusively peaceful nature . " it said iran should use talks between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator on may 31 to signal a change in policy that will allow full negotiations to resolve the nuclear standoff to resume . iran 's hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad reacted defiantly to the report and to threats of fresh sanctions from the west , saying iran would not retreat " a single step " on its nuclear program . meanwhile , france and the united states warned that the un security council would have to discuss a third package of sanctions measures against iran unless it made a major about-turn by freezing sensitive nuclear work . but president mahmoud ahmadinejad indicated the islamic republic was in no mood to cave into the demands of the west . " the enemies aim to prevent us from using peaceful nuclear technology , not for scientific reasons but because they want to eradicate the roots of the principles of the islamic republic , " he said on thursday , according to the isna news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- r -rrb- is known for his fiery anti-western speeches " therefore if we stop , even for a moment , they will achieve their aims , " he told a group of elite revolutionary guards commanders . ahmadinejad made the comments a day after the international atomic energy agency said that iran was making substantial advances in uranium enrichment in defiance of world demands to stop . new sanctions threat the iaea board will review its assessement in june , paving the way for a security council meeting on iran that could agree new sanctions in addition to existing measures against iran 's nuclear and ballistics industries . new french foreign minister bernard kouchner said paris backed the rapid adoption of " new sanctions " against iran if it maintains its refusal . " if that is the case , i hope that we can rapidly adopt new sanctions that will show iran that the path it has chosen is unacceptable and will only drive it into growing isolation , " said kouchner , who was on a visit to lebanon . us warning the united states said that unless iran agreed to a longstanding offer to suspend sensitive nuclear work as a prelude to negotiations , there was no other option than a drive for further sanctions . " iran is once again thumbing its nose at the international community , " us under secretary of state nicholas burns said after the iaea report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran inaugurated two minor plants at its bushehr nuclear reactor in april " should it turn down the offer again , i would think what you 'd see is a strong drive " by the us security council for a third sanctions resolution . at issue is iran 's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment , a process that can be used both to make nuclear fuel and highly enriched uranium for the explosive core of an atomic bomb . the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons but the islamic republic insists it just wants to generate energy for a growing population . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran expects " new ideas " from eu to end nuclear standoff iran 's nuclear negotiator ali larijani said wednesday that he expected new ideas from eu foreign policy chief javier solana on breaking the standoff over tehran 's disputed nuclear program .

" the presidency urgently appeals to iran to reconsider its policy and to comply with the demands of the international community , " the eu presidency said in statement . it said the european union has taken note of the latest report of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on iran with " great concern . " in the report , iaea director mohamed elbaradei accused iran of failing to cooperate with his agency 's inspectors and said that he agreed with us assessments that iran could acquire nuclear weapons within the next decade . " in other words three to eight years from now , " he said . the eu said the report confirmed that iran has flouted two recent un resolutions demanding that the islamic republic suspend uranium enrichment , which is at the heart of its standoff with the west . " iran has disregarded these appeals and continued to drive forward its nuclear program as well as restricting its cooperation with the iaea . " eu urges tehran to prove " peaceful " program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's ferrero-waldner , steinmeier and solana the eu presidency called on tehran to cooperate with iaea inspectors in order to convince the world of its claims that its nuclear program is of " an exclusively peaceful nature .

" the enemies aim to prevent us from using peaceful nuclear technology , not for scientific reasons but because they want to eradicate the roots of the principles of the islamic republic , " he said on thursday , according to the isna news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- r -rrb- is known for his fiery anti-western speeches " therefore if we stop , even for a moment , they will achieve their aims , " he told a group of elite revolutionary guards commanders . ahmadinejad made the comments a day after the international atomic energy agency said that iran was making substantial advances in uranium enrichment in defiance of world demands to stop . new sanctions threat the iaea board will review its assessement in june , paving the way for a security council meeting on iran that could agree new sanctions in addition to existing measures against iran 's nuclear and ballistics industries . new french foreign minister bernard kouchner said paris backed the rapid adoption of " new sanctions " against iran if it maintains its refusal . " if that is the case , i hope that we can rapidly adopt new sanctions that will show iran that the path it has chosen is unacceptable and will only drive it into growing isolation , " said kouchner , who was on a visit to lebanon . us warning the united states said that unless iran agreed to a longstanding offer to suspend sensitive nuclear work as a prelude to negotiations , there was no other option than a drive for further sanctions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 24.05.2007 merkel sets g8 agenda , doubts concrete results großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will host the g8 conference in heiligendamm in early june climate change , development aid and hedge-fund transparency would top the agenda at the g8 summit on june 6-8 , said chancellor angela merkel thursday , but she was n't confident that much progress would be made . chancellor angela merkel appealed to the world 's major industrial countries thursday in a speech to germany 's parliament to cut back on greenhouse gas emissions and step up their participation in the fight against climate change .
" it is important that the g8 develops a common understand of how climate change can be tackled and what agreements can be made for the period beyond 2012 , " said merkel , referring to the year when the kyoto protocol expires .
merkel pessimistic about results the chancellor added , however , that she did n't expect concrete results to be achieved during the meeting of the group of eight industrialized countries on june 6-8 in the northern german city of heiligendamm .
" i can say quite openly that i do n't know if we will succeed in that at heiligendamm , " said merkel in her speech .
" but for me it is clear that the big developed nations must take the lead on this issue if we are to have a change at fighting climate change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 has to decide on kyoto 's successor environmental minister sigmar gabriel from the social democratic party said earlier this week in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf that said talks on climate change would be " super difficult " because of the position of the us .
" we have to put the pressure on , " he added .
germany wants code of conduct chancellor merkel on thursday also named hedge-fund transparency as a priority on the g8 agenda .
hedge-funds are an aggressive and risky investment tool estimated to incorporate some 1.5 trillion dollars world-wide .
transparency in the hedge-fund sector is " urgently necessary " to boost " confidence in the economy , " said the chancellor , adding that germany supports the development of an official code of conduct for the branch .
resistance to regulations in the hedge-fund sector has come from the us and britain , where most of the world 's 9,000 hedge-funds are located .
the chancellor acknowledged that steps had been made at the meeting of g8 finance ministers last weekend in potsdam , but , as with the climate change discussion , she also conceded that the negotiation process would need to be continued after the g8 summit .
focus on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono -lrb- left -rrb- and bob geldof have criticized the g8 development aid for africa would be another central discussion topic at the summit , said merkel , affirming that the g8 countries would honor the promises for development aid increases that they had made at their 2005 summit .
" we will keep these promises , " she said .
" the time has come to implement and our credibility is at stake . "
merkel announced that the increase in development aid could be financed with the fees the state exacts from companies for disposing of contaminating waste .
leaders from algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria , senegal and south africa have been invited to join the g8 member states as guests at the conference .
merkel defends police action in addition , merkel addressed g8 protesters .
protest must be peaceful , she said , " those who resort to violence make dialogue impossible . "

" it is important that the g8 develops a common understand of how climate change can be tackled and what agreements can be made for the period beyond 2012 , " said merkel , referring to the year when the kyoto protocol expires .
merkel pessimistic about results the chancellor added , however , that she did n't expect concrete results to be achieved during the meeting of the group of eight industrialized countries on june 6-8 in the northern german city of heiligendamm .
" i can say quite openly that i do n't know if we will succeed in that at heiligendamm , " said merkel in her speech .
" but for me it is clear that the big developed nations must take the lead on this issue if we are to have a change at fighting climate change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 has to decide on kyoto 's successor environmental minister sigmar gabriel from the social democratic party said earlier this week in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf that said talks on climate change would be " super difficult " because of the position of the us .
" we have to put the pressure on , " he added .
germany wants code of conduct chancellor merkel on thursday also named hedge-fund transparency as a priority on the g8 agenda .
hedge-funds are an aggressive and risky investment tool estimated to incorporate some 1.5 trillion dollars world-wide .
transparency in the hedge-fund sector is " urgently necessary " to boost " confidence in the economy , " said the chancellor , adding that germany supports the development of an official code of conduct for the branch .
resistance to regulations in the hedge-fund sector has come from the us and britain , where most of the world 's 9,000 hedge-funds are located .
the chancellor acknowledged that steps had been made at the meeting of g8 finance ministers last weekend in potsdam , but , as with the climate change discussion , she also conceded that the negotiation process would need to be continued after the g8 summit .
focus on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono -lrb- left -rrb- and bob geldof have criticized the g8 development aid for africa would be another central discussion topic at the summit , said merkel , affirming that the g8 countries would honor the promises for development aid increases that they had made at their 2005 summit .
" we will keep these promises , " she said .
" the time has come to implement and our credibility is at stake . "
merkel announced that the increase in development aid could be financed with the fees the state exacts from companies for disposing of contaminating waste .
leaders from algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria , senegal and south africa have been invited to join the g8 member states as guests at the conference .
merkel defends police action in addition , merkel addressed g8 protesters .
protest must be peaceful , she said , " those who resort to violence make dialogue impossible . "

the new joint venture , which will be based in tyumen in western siberia , is also aiming to reinforce its market presence in the region by participating in the privatization of russian state power company tgk-10 .

" a simplified treaty is the only way forwards , " sarkozy told reporters at the joint press conference .
on his second foreign trip after his inauguration last week , the french leader said he was determined to make sure that agreement was reached at the eu summit next month .
he underlined that it was crucial that the eu break its current deadlock after french and dutch voters rejected the draft eu constitution in referenda in 2005 .
" i am convinced that europe can not remain at a standstill .

we can not remain in this relative paralysis , " said sarkozy .
" we have to find a way out of this impasse , " he added .
slimline treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy clearly wants to put france back at the heart of europe the french president would like to see the streamlined document including provision for a permanent eu presidency to replace the current rotating one , possibilities for " enhanced cooperation " between eu states and a move from unanimity to majority voting .
immigration issues should also be covered by the new treaty , he said .
a new eu rulebook is needed to ensure efficient and rapid decision-making in a bloc which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states over recent years .
the french president emphasised that the scaled-down treaty should be agreed by the member states ' parliaments rather than being put to the people .
during a debate about the constitutional crisis in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the concept of an " eu constitution " had put off many dutch voters who see the document as a threat to national sovereignty .
problematic symbol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is one of the dissenting voices in the debate " it is clear that the symbol of the constitution was an important reason for the no vote , " said balkenende .
he stressed the need for reform , but called for it to be achieved in small steps .
but some important european players reject the idea of scaling down the constitution .
italian prime minister romano prodi has attacked the idea of the french " mini-treaty " and threatened that a vanguard of european nations who want closer integration could go it alone .
germany , which currently holds the rotating six-month eu presidency , has also said repeatedly that it wants the " substance " of the constitution to be preserved and the charter of fundamental rights to be annexed to the new treaty .
chancellor angela merkel has made resurrecting the failed constitution a top priority .
at the eu summit in june she is expected to call on all governments to rally behind her proposals for a new " road map " for europe to be ratified before european parliament elections in summer 2009 . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant e.on drops bid for spanish utility ending a long battle , german energy giant e.on said monday it had abandoned its takeover bid for spanish power company endesa , but planned to buy assets from the group worth about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- .

it was a triumphant finale to a season which started with the club being docked eight points for their involvement in italy 's match-fixing scandal .
only a successful appeal against an initial , heavier , penalty enabled milan to enter the champions league at all , and they were forced to begin their campaign in the final qualifying round .
defying the odds " it is the greatest victory we have had , " ac milan coach carlo ancelotti said .
" few believed we could do it , but we have actually done something extraordinary that very few people , perhaps nobody , expected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool supporters dreams crushed in athens on wednesday .
liverpool 's chances of pulling a repeat of their 2005 victory over ancelotti 's men were dealt a severe blow by milan 's opening goal : an andrea pirlo free-kick that beat jose reina with the help of a deflection off inzaghi 's shoulder .
the striker had no hesitation in claiming the credit for the goal .
" of course we worked on that in training and sometimes it comes off , " he said , apparently tongue-in-cheek .
liverpool bruised , but gracious liverpool boss rafael benitez was enraged by the scarcity of extra time , but played down his touchline explosion afterwards .
" i do n't want to use this as an excuse , " the spaniard said .
" we were playing well until we conceded the first goal , and they have players with the quality to make the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final in athens : liverpool started out strong , but could n't match filippo inzaghi 's double strike .
" we were controlling the game , going forward and creating chances but we conceded a bad goal at a bad time , " benitez said .
line up changes failed with just under an hour gone , benitez introduced harry kewell .
but he proved no more effective than the man he replaced , bolo zenden .
the manager rejected suggestions he should have been bolder and started with the australian winger rather than packing five men across his midfield .
" kewell could not play a long time , he was ten months without playing , " benitez said . " milan are well organized in defence and good on counter attack .
when you try to attack , you have to keep a balance and not leave big spaces behind .
when you lose the balance against them they just need one opportunity and they will kill you . "
lucky opening goal ancelotti acknowledged that milan 's opening goal had been the lucky break his side needed against opponents who posed them far more problems than manchester united had in the semi-final .
" liverpool did not let us play the way we wanted in the first half , " ancelotti said .
" our midfielders were under pressure and we did not get the ball to kaka and clarence seedorf as much as we wanted . "
but he said this was a tough team and they had managed a difficult situation quite well . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milan face two opponents in liverpool and foolish revenge ac milan have waited two years to avenge the 2005 champions league final defeat to liverpool .

in an interview , the head of the stasi museum in leipzig explains why the issue is so emotive . tobias hollitzer is the head of the stasi " runde ecke " museum in the eastern german city of leipzig .

but these jars were part of the east german secret police 's collection of scent samples used to keep track of dissidents . hollitzer talked to dw-world.de about the stasi 's collection of people 's smells and what he thinks of law enforcement using the method today . dw-world.de : mr. hollitzer , the east german secret police , the stasi , collected scent samples .
why ? the stasi had a whole range of methods and means to try to track down people who said or did anything critical of the east german communist regime . collecting scent samples was used to try to identify those , for example , who had distributed flyers or who wrote critical graffiti . how did the stasi collect these samples ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained dogs are used to identify people 's smells when they found a piece of graffiti or a flyer then they took a dust cloth , which was usually yellow , and left it for a while lying next to the flyers covered by a protective piece of aluminum foil and then they had their sample .
the cloth was then sealed in a pickling jar and stored .
if the stasi later came across a suspect in the process of the investigation , they tried to get a sample from this person as well - of course , secretly .
a trained dog was given the two smells , and if they matched , the stasi had a concrete name . how did the stasi collected samples from people secretly ? they would often invite someone in for a talk with the police or other officials , for example , and undercover stasi officers pretending to be police officers or an administrative person were usually present at this meeting .
and while the person sat on the chair in the office , they would be , without knowing it , impregnating a yellow cloth hidden under the seat .
when this fictive visit was over , the stasi officer would then put the cloth in the pickle jar - and they had their sample . was scent sampling a method developed by the stasi ? no , it 's a well-known police method used in criminal investigations , but even in the gdr it was n't allowed to be admitted as evidence and that 's why the samples were often collected secretly instead of openly .
the problem is not with scent profiling as such , but rather with collecting scents as a precautionary measure in case they can eventually be used in the future .
this is what the stasi did - they had a giant scent register of dissidents .
they really tried to have a sample of everyone who potentially could have said something critical of the state how many samples are we talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi collected as much information as possible about people i 'm not sure of concrete numbers because in 1989 -lrb- when the berlin wall fell -rrb- the samples were destroyed and they are n't listed in the stasi files .

collecting samples on the suspicion that people could protest or offend in the future clearly harks back to stasi times , when security officials operated without any type of state limitation . in these times of the so-called war on terror , do you think the german state is going too far in its security activities ? the state has being going too far for a very long time - it 's just that now the issues surrounding the collection of scent samples are making this evident because here in germany , the stasi are so strongly associated with this particular method . if you take a look at what has happened here since sept 11. with new security laws , then we have to ask the question of how much freedom we want to sacrifice in the name of security .

" a simplified treaty is the only way forwards , " sarkozy told reporters at the joint press conference .
on his second foreign trip after his inauguration last week , the french leader said he was determined to make sure that agreement was reached at the eu summit next month .
he underlined that it was crucial that the eu break its current deadlock after french and dutch voters rejected the draft eu constitution in referenda in 2005 .
" i am convinced that europe can not remain at a standstill .
we can not remain in this relative paralysis , " said sarkozy .
" we have to find a way out of this impasse , " he added .
slimline treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy clearly wants to put france back at the heart of europe the french president would like to see the streamlined document including provision for a permanent eu presidency to replace the current rotating one , possibilities for " enhanced cooperation " between eu states and a move from unanimity to majority voting .
immigration issues should also be covered by the new treaty , he said .
a new eu rulebook is needed to ensure efficient and rapid decision-making in a bloc which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states over recent years .
the french president emphasised that the scaled-down treaty should be agreed by the member states ' parliaments rather than being put to the people .
during a debate about the constitutional crisis in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the concept of an " eu constitution " had put off many dutch voters who see the document as a threat to national sovereignty .
problematic symbol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is one of the dissenting voices in the debate " it is clear that the symbol of the constitution was an important reason for the no vote , " said balkenende .
he stressed the need for reform , but called for it to be achieved in small steps .
but some important european players reject the idea of scaling down the constitution .
italian prime minister romano prodi has attacked the idea of the french " mini-treaty " and threatened that a vanguard of european nations who want closer integration could go it alone .
germany , which currently holds the rotating six-month eu presidency , has also said repeatedly that it wants the " substance " of the constitution to be preserved and the charter of fundamental rights to be annexed to the new treaty .
chancellor angela merkel has made resurrecting the failed constitution a top priority .
at the eu summit in june she is expected to call on all governments to rally behind her proposals for a new " road map " for europe to be ratified before european parliament elections in summer 2009 . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant e.on drops bid for spanish utility ending a long battle , german energy giant e.on said monday it had abandoned its takeover bid for spanish power company endesa , but planned to buy assets from the group worth about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- .

the deal would give e.on access to an electricity market which is growing at an annual rate of five to six percent , the company said in a written statement .
" the upcoming liberalization of russia 's wholesale electricity sector will create an attractive business environment for investment in electricity generation , " it added .
ambitious plans e.on said that its long-term goal was to build up a strong position in the rapidly growing industrial regions in the urals , western siberia , volga , as well as in central russia .
the new joint venture , which will be based in tyumen in western siberia , is also aiming to reinforce its market presence in the region by participating in the privatization of russian state power company tgk-10 .
sts is involved in both power production and distribution and supplies some 1.1 million gas and electricity customers in western siberia .
it plans to transfer some of its own generating capacity into the new joint venture , e.on said .
the german company has not revealed how much money it will be investing in its project .
the news comes shortly after e.on 's plans to takeover spain 's endesa failed at the beginning of april .
sector privatization e.on has been keen to gain access to the russian electricity market for some time , but the sector has remained firmly in state hands .
russia 's state-owned holding compay rao ues is now taking steps to liberalize the electricity market to respond to the growing demand for power .
the industry , according to e.on , will require annual investments of some 15 billion euros over the next 15 years .

it was a triumphant finale to a season which started with the club being docked eight points for their involvement in italy 's match-fixing scandal .
only a successful appeal against an initial , heavier , penalty enabled milan to enter the champions league at all , and they were forced to begin their campaign in the final qualifying round .

" kewell could not play a long time , he was ten months without playing , " benitez said . " milan are well organized in defence and good on counter attack .
when you try to attack , you have to keep a balance and not leave big spaces behind .
when you lose the balance against them they just need one opportunity and they will kill you . "

" liverpool did not let us play the way we wanted in the first half , " ancelotti said .
" our midfielders were under pressure and we did not get the ball to kaka and clarence seedorf as much as we wanted . "

" it is important that the g8 develops a common understand of how climate change can be tackled and what agreements can be made for the period beyond 2012 , " said merkel , referring to the year when the kyoto protocol expires .
merkel pessimistic about results the chancellor added , however , that she did n't expect concrete results to be achieved during the meeting of the group of eight industrialized countries on june 6-8 in the northern german city of heiligendamm .
" i can say quite openly that i do n't know if we will succeed in that at heiligendamm , " said merkel in her speech .
" but for me it is clear that the big developed nations must take the lead on this issue if we are to have a change at fighting climate change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 has to decide on kyoto 's successor environmental minister sigmar gabriel from the social democratic party said earlier this week in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf that said talks on climate change would be " super difficult " because of the position of the us .
" we have to put the pressure on , " he added .
germany wants code of conduct chancellor merkel on thursday also named hedge-fund transparency as a priority on the g8 agenda .
hedge-funds are an aggressive and risky investment tool estimated to incorporate some 1.5 trillion dollars world-wide .
transparency in the hedge-fund sector is " urgently necessary " to boost " confidence in the economy , " said the chancellor , adding that germany supports the development of an official code of conduct for the branch .
resistance to regulations in the hedge-fund sector has come from the us and britain , where most of the world 's 9,000 hedge-funds are located .
the chancellor acknowledged that steps had been made at the meeting of g8 finance ministers last weekend in potsdam , but , as with the climate change discussion , she also conceded that the negotiation process would need to be continued after the g8 summit .

" we will keep these promises , " she said .
" the time has come to implement and our credibility is at stake . "
merkel announced that the increase in development aid could be financed with the fees the state exacts from companies for disposing of contaminating waste .
leaders from algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria , senegal and south africa have been invited to join the g8 member states as guests at the conference .
merkel defends police action in addition , merkel addressed g8 protesters .
protest must be peaceful , she said , " those who resort to violence make dialogue impossible . "
at the same time , the chancellor defended the security measures that have been implemented in germany in the run-up to the summit .
police have recently come under fire for raiding the offices of left-wing groups and taking body scent samples to be used in the event of a crime .

" it is important that the g8 develops a common understand of how climate change can be tackled and what agreements can be made for the period beyond 2012 , " said merkel , referring to the year when the kyoto protocol expires .
merkel pessimistic about results the chancellor added , however , that she did n't expect concrete results to be achieved during the meeting of the group of eight industrialized countries on june 6-8 in the northern german city of heiligendamm .
" i can say quite openly that i do n't know if we will succeed in that at heiligendamm , " said merkel in her speech .
" but for me it is clear that the big developed nations must take the lead on this issue if we are to have a change at fighting climate change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 has to decide on kyoto 's successor environmental minister sigmar gabriel from the social democratic party said earlier this week in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf that said talks on climate change would be " super difficult " because of the position of the us .
" we have to put the pressure on , " he added .
germany wants code of conduct chancellor merkel on thursday also named hedge-fund transparency as a priority on the g8 agenda .
hedge-funds are an aggressive and risky investment tool estimated to incorporate some 1.5 trillion dollars world-wide .
transparency in the hedge-fund sector is " urgently necessary " to boost " confidence in the economy , " said the chancellor , adding that germany supports the development of an official code of conduct for the branch .
resistance to regulations in the hedge-fund sector has come from the us and britain , where most of the world 's 9,000 hedge-funds are located .
the chancellor acknowledged that steps had been made at the meeting of g8 finance ministers last weekend in potsdam , but , as with the climate change discussion , she also conceded that the negotiation process would need to be continued after the g8 summit .
focus on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono -lrb- left -rrb- and bob geldof have criticized the g8 development aid for africa would be another central discussion topic at the summit , said merkel , affirming that the g8 countries would honor the promises for development aid increases that they had made at their 2005 summit .
" we will keep these promises , " she said .
" the time has come to implement and our credibility is at stake . "
merkel announced that the increase in development aid could be financed with the fees the state exacts from companies for disposing of contaminating waste .
leaders from algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria , senegal and south africa have been invited to join the g8 member states as guests at the conference .
merkel defends police action in addition , merkel addressed g8 protesters .
protest must be peaceful , she said , " those who resort to violence make dialogue impossible . "
at the same time , the chancellor defended the security measures that have been implemented in germany in the run-up to the summit .
police have recently come under fire for raiding the offices of left-wing groups and taking body scent samples to be used in the event of a crime .

" the presidency urgently appeals to iran to reconsider its policy and to comply with the demands of the international community , " the eu presidency said in statement . it said the european union has taken note of the latest report of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on iran with " great concern . " in the report , iaea director mohamed elbaradei accused iran of failing to cooperate with his agency 's inspectors and said that he agreed with us assessments that iran could acquire nuclear weapons within the next decade . " in other words three to eight years from now , " he said . the eu said the report confirmed that iran has flouted two recent un resolutions demanding that the islamic republic suspend uranium enrichment , which is at the heart of its standoff with the west . " iran has disregarded these appeals and continued to drive forward its nuclear program as well as restricting its cooperation with the iaea . " eu urges tehran to prove " peaceful " program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's ferrero-waldner , steinmeier and solana the eu presidency called on tehran to cooperate with iaea inspectors in order to convince the world of its claims that its nuclear program is of " an exclusively peaceful nature . " it said iran should use talks between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator on may 31 to signal a change in policy that will allow full negotiations to resolve the nuclear standoff to resume . iran 's hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad reacted defiantly to the report and to threats of fresh sanctions from the west , saying iran would not retreat " a single step " on its nuclear program . meanwhile , france and the united states warned that the un security council would have to discuss a third package of sanctions measures against iran unless it made a major about-turn by freezing sensitive nuclear work . but president mahmoud ahmadinejad indicated the islamic republic was in no mood to cave into the demands of the west . " the enemies aim to prevent us from using peaceful nuclear technology , not for scientific reasons but because they want to eradicate the roots of the principles of the islamic republic , " he said on thursday , according to the isna news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- r -rrb- is known for his fiery anti-western speeches " therefore if we stop , even for a moment , they will achieve their aims , " he told a group of elite revolutionary guards commanders . ahmadinejad made the comments a day after the international atomic energy agency said that iran was making substantial advances in uranium enrichment in defiance of world demands to stop . new sanctions threat the iaea board will review its assessement in june , paving the way for a security council meeting on iran that could agree new sanctions in addition to existing measures against iran 's nuclear and ballistics industries . new french foreign minister bernard kouchner said paris backed the rapid adoption of " new sanctions " against iran if it maintains its refusal . " if that is the case , i hope that we can rapidly adopt new sanctions that will show iran that the path it has chosen is unacceptable and will only drive it into growing isolation , " said kouchner , who was on a visit to lebanon . us warning the united states said that unless iran agreed to a longstanding offer to suspend sensitive nuclear work as a prelude to negotiations , there was no other option than a drive for further sanctions . " iran is once again thumbing its nose at the international community , " us under secretary of state nicholas burns said after the iaea report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran inaugurated two minor plants at its bushehr nuclear reactor in april " should it turn down the offer again , i would think what you 'd see is a strong drive " by the us security council for a third sanctions resolution . at issue is iran 's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment , a process that can be used both to make nuclear fuel and highly enriched uranium for the explosive core of an atomic bomb . the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons but the islamic republic insists it just wants to generate energy for a growing population . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran expects " new ideas " from eu to end nuclear standoff iran 's nuclear negotiator ali larijani said wednesday that he expected new ideas from eu foreign policy chief javier solana on breaking the standoff over tehran 's disputed nuclear program .

" the presidency urgently appeals to iran to reconsider its policy and to comply with the demands of the international community , " the eu presidency said in statement . it said the european union has taken note of the latest report of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on iran with " great concern . " in the report , iaea director mohamed elbaradei accused iran of failing to cooperate with his agency 's inspectors and said that he agreed with us assessments that iran could acquire nuclear weapons within the next decade . " in other words three to eight years from now , " he said . the eu said the report confirmed that iran has flouted two recent un resolutions demanding that the islamic republic suspend uranium enrichment , which is at the heart of its standoff with the west . " iran has disregarded these appeals and continued to drive forward its nuclear program as well as restricting its cooperation with the iaea . " eu urges tehran to prove " peaceful " program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's ferrero-waldner , steinmeier and solana the eu presidency called on tehran to cooperate with iaea inspectors in order to convince the world of its claims that its nuclear program is of " an exclusively peaceful nature . " it said iran should use talks between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator on may 31 to signal a change in policy that will allow full negotiations to resolve the nuclear standoff to resume . iran 's hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad reacted defiantly to the report and to threats of fresh sanctions from the west , saying iran would not retreat " a single step " on its nuclear program . meanwhile , france and the united states warned that the un security council would have to discuss a third package of sanctions measures against iran unless it made a major about-turn by freezing sensitive nuclear work . but president mahmoud ahmadinejad indicated the islamic republic was in no mood to cave into the demands of the west . " the enemies aim to prevent us from using peaceful nuclear technology , not for scientific reasons but because they want to eradicate the roots of the principles of the islamic republic , " he said on thursday , according to the isna news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- r -rrb- is known for his fiery anti-western speeches " therefore if we stop , even for a moment , they will achieve their aims , " he told a group of elite revolutionary guards commanders . ahmadinejad made the comments a day after the international atomic energy agency said that iran was making substantial advances in uranium enrichment in defiance of world demands to stop . new sanctions threat the iaea board will review its assessement in june , paving the way for a security council meeting on iran that could agree new sanctions in addition to existing measures against iran 's nuclear and ballistics industries . new french foreign minister bernard kouchner said paris backed the rapid adoption of " new sanctions " against iran if it maintains its refusal . " if that is the case , i hope that we can rapidly adopt new sanctions that will show iran that the path it has chosen is unacceptable and will only drive it into growing isolation , " said kouchner , who was on a visit to lebanon . us warning the united states said that unless iran agreed to a longstanding offer to suspend sensitive nuclear work as a prelude to negotiations , there was no other option than a drive for further sanctions .

can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .
today our work is more complex and that makes it more difficult .
the suffering is not as striking and not as visible as it was then , but it 's nevertheless just as big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey is on his second mission in darfur chancellor angela merkel was critical this week at the africa summit and said that african states should guarantee that aid actually arrives where it 's needed .
what 's your opinion about this ?
the criticism is valid .
aid is often not given where it 's needed most but where it brings the most political gain .
doctors without borders is active where medical assistance is needed the most .
for this reason , we 're also present in the places where other organizations do n't go .
the darfur conflict will be discussed this week by the un human rights council and again in june at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
what are your expectations for these conferences ?
i 'm hopeful but i do n't have any big expectations .
aside from the meetings , it is my wish that the people wo n't have to live in camps any longer but can live at home and at peace with each other , and that they really have all the medical assistance that they need .
but that 's an optimistic wish .
it 's important that the people here are n't forgotten in the near future , which unfortunately happens often when a conflict drags on for years .
matthias hrubey is a general practitioner and the associate national coordinator for doctors without borders in darfur .

can you benefit from the discussion ?
matthias hrubey : the country and the media are talking a lot about the situation in darfur , but not about the population and how the people here are doing .
and they 're not doing as well as they should be .
what are the problems you 're dealing with at the moment ?
in one of our projects there was a major outbreak of meningitis and we had to start a vaccination campaign .
the risk of a cholera outbreak is increasing now that the rainy season has begun .
the disease could break out in the camps as well as in the countryside .
we 've joined forces to prepare ourselves .
in addition , the people frequently suffer from dysentery due to the poor hygiene and water conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey said dysentery is a common illness due to poor hygiene conditions are you able to get to the people suffering from health problems ?
at the moment , it 's very different to reach the people .
especially in the rural areas , we have to use helicopters because the streets are simply too unsafe .
what 's your current project ?
it 's a mountain region that has n't had any access to medical aid until now .
we 're trying to change that and help the more than 100,000 people there .
how dangerous is your work at the moment ?
in the past weeks , nothing has happened to us personally because we work very carefully .
every doctors without borders project has detailed security guidelines that are regularly adjusted to fit the current situation .
but not a week goes by when we do n't hear about an incident .
it 's a constant strain ; something could happen any minute .
you were in the region in 2004 and returned 10 months ago .
what has changed since your previous stay in darfur ?
the situation has n't gotten any easier , but it has changed .
when i was on a project in 2004 we had a major medical emergency involving numerous malnourished children .
today our work is more complex and that makes it more difficult .
the suffering is not as striking and not as visible as it was then , but it 's nevertheless just as big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrubey is on his second mission in darfur chancellor angela merkel was critical this week at the africa summit and said that african states should guarantee that aid actually arrives where it 's needed .
what 's your opinion about this ?
the criticism is valid .
aid is often not given where it 's needed most but where it brings the most political gain .
doctors without borders is active where medical assistance is needed the most .
for this reason , we 're also present in the places where other organizations do n't go .
the darfur conflict will be discussed this week by the un human rights council and again in june at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
what are your expectations for these conferences ?
i 'm hopeful but i do n't have any big expectations .
aside from the meetings , it is my wish that the people wo n't have to live in camps any longer but can live at home and at peace with each other , and that they really have all the medical assistance that they need .
but that 's an optimistic wish .
it 's important that the people here are n't forgotten in the near future , which unfortunately happens often when a conflict drags on for years .
matthias hrubey is a general practitioner and the associate national coordinator for doctors without borders in darfur .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 24.05.2007 french proposal to end eu crisis makes headway großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a streamlined eu constitution might meet voter support french president nicolas sarkozy 's idea of a simplified treaty designed to end the european union 's constitional crisis appears to be gaining support . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said after talks with sarkozy in brussels on wednesday that a consensus was emerging among eu leaders in support of the plan to scale down the constitution .
" a simplified treaty is the only way forwards , " sarkozy told reporters at the joint press conference .
on his second foreign trip after his inauguration last week , the french leader said he was determined to make sure that agreement was reached at the eu summit next month .
he underlined that it was crucial that the eu break its current deadlock after french and dutch voters rejected the draft eu constitution in referenda in 2005 .
" i am convinced that europe can not remain at a standstill .
we can not remain in this relative paralysis , " said sarkozy .
" we have to find a way out of this impasse , " he added .
slimline treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy clearly wants to put france back at the heart of europe the french president would like to see the streamlined document including provision for a permanent eu presidency to replace the current rotating one , possibilities for " enhanced cooperation " between eu states and a move from unanimity to majority voting .
immigration issues should also be covered by the new treaty , he said .
a new eu rulebook is needed to ensure efficient and rapid decision-making in a bloc which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states over recent years .
the french president emphasised that the scaled-down treaty should be agreed by the member states ' parliaments rather than being put to the people .
during a debate about the constitutional crisis in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the concept of an " eu constitution " had put off many dutch voters who see the document as a threat to national sovereignty .
problematic symbol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is one of the dissenting voices in the debate " it is clear that the symbol of the constitution was an important reason for the no vote , " said balkenende .
he stressed the need for reform , but called for it to be achieved in small steps .
but some important european players reject the idea of scaling down the constitution .
italian prime minister romano prodi has attacked the idea of the french " mini-treaty " and threatened that a vanguard of european nations who want closer integration could go it alone .
germany , which currently holds the rotating six-month eu presidency , has also said repeatedly that it wants the " substance " of the constitution to be preserved and the charter of fundamental rights to be annexed to the new treaty .

in an interview , the head of the stasi museum in leipzig explains why the issue is so emotive . tobias hollitzer is the head of the stasi " runde ecke " museum in the eastern german city of leipzig .
a row of sealed jars , each containing a seemingly innocuous yellow dust cloth , forms part of the museum 's permanent exhibition .
but these jars were part of the east german secret police 's collection of scent samples used to keep track of dissidents . hollitzer talked to dw-world.de about the stasi 's collection of people 's smells and what he thinks of law enforcement using the method today . dw-world.de : mr. hollitzer , the east german secret police , the stasi , collected scent samples .
why ? the stasi had a whole range of methods and means to try to track down people who said or did anything critical of the east german communist regime . collecting scent samples was used to try to identify those , for example , who had distributed flyers or who wrote critical graffiti . how did the stasi collect these samples ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained dogs are used to identify people 's smells when they found a piece of graffiti or a flyer then they took a dust cloth , which was usually yellow , and left it for a while lying next to the flyers covered by a protective piece of aluminum foil and then they had their sample .
the cloth was then sealed in a pickling jar and stored .
if the stasi later came across a suspect in the process of the investigation , they tried to get a sample from this person as well - of course , secretly .
a trained dog was given the two smells , and if they matched , the stasi had a concrete name . how did the stasi collected samples from people secretly ? they would often invite someone in for a talk with the police or other officials , for example , and undercover stasi officers pretending to be police officers or an administrative person were usually present at this meeting .
and while the person sat on the chair in the office , they would be , without knowing it , impregnating a yellow cloth hidden under the seat .
when this fictive visit was over , the stasi officer would then put the cloth in the pickle jar - and they had their sample . was scent sampling a method developed by the stasi ? no , it 's a well-known police method used in criminal investigations , but even in the gdr it was n't allowed to be admitted as evidence and that 's why the samples were often collected secretly instead of openly .
the problem is not with scent profiling as such , but rather with collecting scents as a precautionary measure in case they can eventually be used in the future .
this is what the stasi did - they had a giant scent register of dissidents .
they really tried to have a sample of everyone who potentially could have said something critical of the state how many samples are we talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi collected as much information as possible about people i 'm not sure of concrete numbers because in 1989 -lrb- when the berlin wall fell -rrb- the samples were destroyed and they are n't listed in the stasi files .
but just in the leipzig area , it would have certainly been several thousand . what do you think of current reports that german police have collected scent samples from activists who could be involved in violence in the lead-up to the g8 summit ? i think it is important to be very clear that the danger of the method is using it without having a concrete crime .
collecting samples on the suspicion that people could protest or offend in the future clearly harks back to stasi times , when security officials operated without any type of state limitation . in these times of the so-called war on terror , do you think the german state is going too far in its security activities ? the state has being going too far for a very long time - it 's just that now the issues surrounding the collection of scent samples are making this evident because here in germany , the stasi are so strongly associated with this particular method . if you take a look at what has happened here since sept 11. with new security laws , then we have to ask the question of how much freedom we want to sacrifice in the name of security .

peter danckert : the additional confessions did n't come as a surprise to me .
for quite some time i 've been aware that doping is widespread , not only in germany but also in the international cycling scene .
i expect more to come in the next few days and months .
i also think that the confessions are not going to stop at the german border .
what are the biggest challenges in the fight against doping ?
we are dealing with widespread doping in cycling and other olympic sports that are less in the public eye at the moment .
we are working with deficient analysis systems and the testing labs are lagging behind and trying very painstakingly , despite a lack of financial resources , to track down what the economy and the pharmaceutical industry have put on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping is not limited to cyclists it 's becoming more and more apparent to me , when i make an appeal for amnesty-like regulations , that there are large groups within the organized sport scene that do n't even want this , for reasons that i do n't understand .
there is a considerable lack of information concerning the extent of doping , the structures , and the participation of doctors , managers , trainers and possibly even sponsors .
the very first goal must be to gather a picture of the situation that is as comprehensive as possible .
for me , sanctions are the second priority .
i ca n't expect active athletes to commit social or professional suicide by handing in a confession - and i ca n't offer them anything for it either .
they need a second chance and they can only get one if they have the opportunity to explain themselves openly without having to fear sanctions .
some sports organizations , such as the german olympic sport association -lrb- dosb -rrb- , have said that sanctions are more effective than legal penalties .
why are sanctions less important for you ?
there have to be effective legal measure in place , on the one hand .
we 'll have them when the law that is now on the table is passed in the beginning of july , because then the possession of moderate amounts of doping substances will be punishable by law , which gives the authorities a new and more effective approach .
on the other hand , we need understanding on the part of the sports organization .
they have to recognize that their entire sanction system has not been particularly effective .
they 've continually had cases where the doping test results were positive only by coincidence .
and since the tests are n't very effective , the fact that there are relatively few positive tests is n't proof that doping does n't happen but that the doping investigation methods are n't effective .
are you satisfied with the new anti-doping law that is set to be passed in germany in early july ?
to be honest , it does n't totally fulfil my expectations .
i would have wanted more extensive provisions .
but that 's politics .
when you have a coalition partner , you have to discuss with the partner and reach a solution .
as the old saying goes , " politics is the art of the doable . "
we have a law underway that i believe will offer additional investigation approaches in the future .
the federal bureau of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- will take responsibility , the range of punishment will become broader , telephone surveillance may become possible , and maybe a leniency program as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until now , it has been difficult to legally implicate doctors involved in doping cases if the sport scene does its part as well , then the chances are good that the situation will improve .
what can the sport scene do ?
and how can the sport scene and the government work together ?
it 's my hope that , after the statements from four professional cyclists and two doctors in the past few days , the sport world has recognized that these are not isolated cases but that mass doping is now the order of the day .
these are not isolated cases , even looking beyond germany 's borders .
i was in rome recently and spoke with recognized doping experts who said that it 's also widespread in italy , not only in cycling but in other olympic sports as well .
there are considerable deficits in many areas that can only be corrected with the help of the sport world .
for example , we have to convince the sponsors to contribute one percent of their sponsoring funds - which in germany alone amount to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - to the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- so that more can be done for prevention , training checks , competition checks and doping analysis .
that 's where the sport world can get involved - but they have to want to .
in many cases , it 's not just the athletes themselves who are involved in a doping case , but also trainers , managers and even doctors .
to what extent should these people also be subject to penalties ?
a lot has been achieved through the amendment to the pharmaceutical laws , which defines the legal penalties that deal with doping .
it used to be the case that only the sale of illegal substances was punishable .
now , when the law is passed in early july , the possession of moderate amounts of illegal substances will also be punishable .
for the police , the prosecutors and later for the courts , this is an additional and very effective way to fight doping .
it 's not only the athlete that is involved but also the trainers , the managers , the doctors and everyone surrounding the athlete that has been legally untouchable until now .
this will be different in the future and , with the federal bureau of criminal investigation , we have a very effective authority to take care of the job .

peter danckert : the additional confessions did n't come as a surprise to me .
for quite some time i 've been aware that doping is widespread , not only in germany but also in the international cycling scene .
i expect more to come in the next few days and months .
i also think that the confessions are not going to stop at the german border .
what are the biggest challenges in the fight against doping ?
we are dealing with widespread doping in cycling and other olympic sports that are less in the public eye at the moment .
we are working with deficient analysis systems and the testing labs are lagging behind and trying very painstakingly , despite a lack of financial resources , to track down what the economy and the pharmaceutical industry have put on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping is not limited to cyclists it 's becoming more and more apparent to me , when i make an appeal for amnesty-like regulations , that there are large groups within the organized sport scene that do n't even want this , for reasons that i do n't understand .
there is a considerable lack of information concerning the extent of doping , the structures , and the participation of doctors , managers , trainers and possibly even sponsors .
the very first goal must be to gather a picture of the situation that is as comprehensive as possible .
for me , sanctions are the second priority .
i ca n't expect active athletes to commit social or professional suicide by handing in a confession - and i ca n't offer them anything for it either .
they need a second chance and they can only get one if they have the opportunity to explain themselves openly without having to fear sanctions .
some sports organizations , such as the german olympic sport association -lrb- dosb -rrb- , have said that sanctions are more effective than legal penalties .
why are sanctions less important for you ?
there have to be effective legal measure in place , on the one hand .
we 'll have them when the law that is now on the table is passed in the beginning of july , because then the possession of moderate amounts of doping substances will be punishable by law , which gives the authorities a new and more effective approach .
on the other hand , we need understanding on the part of the sports organization .
they have to recognize that their entire sanction system has not been particularly effective .
they 've continually had cases where the doping test results were positive only by coincidence .
and since the tests are n't very effective , the fact that there are relatively few positive tests is n't proof that doping does n't happen but that the doping investigation methods are n't effective .

in an interview , the head of the stasi museum in leipzig explains why the issue is so emotive . tobias hollitzer is the head of the stasi " runde ecke " museum in the eastern german city of leipzig .
a row of sealed jars , each containing a seemingly innocuous yellow dust cloth , forms part of the museum 's permanent exhibition .
but these jars were part of the east german secret police 's collection of scent samples used to keep track of dissidents . hollitzer talked to dw-world.de about the stasi 's collection of people 's smells and what he thinks of law enforcement using the method today . dw-world.de : mr. hollitzer , the east german secret police , the stasi , collected scent samples .
why ? the stasi had a whole range of methods and means to try to track down people who said or did anything critical of the east german communist regime . collecting scent samples was used to try to identify those , for example , who had distributed flyers or who wrote critical graffiti . how did the stasi collect these samples ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained dogs are used to identify people 's smells when they found a piece of graffiti or a flyer then they took a dust cloth , which was usually yellow , and left it for a while lying next to the flyers covered by a protective piece of aluminum foil and then they had their sample .
the cloth was then sealed in a pickling jar and stored .
if the stasi later came across a suspect in the process of the investigation , they tried to get a sample from this person as well - of course , secretly .
a trained dog was given the two smells , and if they matched , the stasi had a concrete name . how did the stasi collected samples from people secretly ? they would often invite someone in for a talk with the police or other officials , for example , and undercover stasi officers pretending to be police officers or an administrative person were usually present at this meeting .
and while the person sat on the chair in the office , they would be , without knowing it , impregnating a yellow cloth hidden under the seat .
when this fictive visit was over , the stasi officer would then put the cloth in the pickle jar - and they had their sample . was scent sampling a method developed by the stasi ? no , it 's a well-known police method used in criminal investigations , but even in the gdr it was n't allowed to be admitted as evidence and that 's why the samples were often collected secretly instead of openly .
the problem is not with scent profiling as such , but rather with collecting scents as a precautionary measure in case they can eventually be used in the future .
this is what the stasi did - they had a giant scent register of dissidents .
they really tried to have a sample of everyone who potentially could have said something critical of the state how many samples are we talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi collected as much information as possible about people i 'm not sure of concrete numbers because in 1989 -lrb- when the berlin wall fell -rrb- the samples were destroyed and they are n't listed in the stasi files .
but just in the leipzig area , it would have certainly been several thousand . what do you think of current reports that german police have collected scent samples from activists who could be involved in violence in the lead-up to the g8 summit ? i think it is important to be very clear that the danger of the method is using it without having a concrete crime .
collecting samples on the suspicion that people could protest or offend in the future clearly harks back to stasi times , when security officials operated without any type of state limitation . in these times of the so-called war on terror , do you think the german state is going too far in its security activities ? the state has being going too far for a very long time - it 's just that now the issues surrounding the collection of scent samples are making this evident because here in germany , the stasi are so strongly associated with this particular method . if you take a look at what has happened here since sept 11. with new security laws , then we have to ask the question of how much freedom we want to sacrifice in the name of security .
information such as telephone and internet data now has to be saved for at least six months .

but these jars were part of the east german secret police 's collection of scent samples used to keep track of dissidents . hollitzer talked to dw-world.de about the stasi 's collection of people 's smells and what he thinks of law enforcement using the method today . dw-world.de : mr. hollitzer , the east german secret police , the stasi , collected scent samples .
why ? the stasi had a whole range of methods and means to try to track down people who said or did anything critical of the east german communist regime . collecting scent samples was used to try to identify those , for example , who had distributed flyers or who wrote critical graffiti . how did the stasi collect these samples ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specially trained dogs are used to identify people 's smells when they found a piece of graffiti or a flyer then they took a dust cloth , which was usually yellow , and left it for a while lying next to the flyers covered by a protective piece of aluminum foil and then they had their sample .
the cloth was then sealed in a pickling jar and stored .
if the stasi later came across a suspect in the process of the investigation , they tried to get a sample from this person as well - of course , secretly .
a trained dog was given the two smells , and if they matched , the stasi had a concrete name . how did the stasi collected samples from people secretly ? they would often invite someone in for a talk with the police or other officials , for example , and undercover stasi officers pretending to be police officers or an administrative person were usually present at this meeting .
and while the person sat on the chair in the office , they would be , without knowing it , impregnating a yellow cloth hidden under the seat .
when this fictive visit was over , the stasi officer would then put the cloth in the pickle jar - and they had their sample . was scent sampling a method developed by the stasi ? no , it 's a well-known police method used in criminal investigations , but even in the gdr it was n't allowed to be admitted as evidence and that 's why the samples were often collected secretly instead of openly .
the problem is not with scent profiling as such , but rather with collecting scents as a precautionary measure in case they can eventually be used in the future .
this is what the stasi did - they had a giant scent register of dissidents .
they really tried to have a sample of everyone who potentially could have said something critical of the state how many samples are we talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi collected as much information as possible about people i 'm not sure of concrete numbers because in 1989 -lrb- when the berlin wall fell -rrb- the samples were destroyed and they are n't listed in the stasi files .
but just in the leipzig area , it would have certainly been several thousand . what do you think of current reports that german police have collected scent samples from activists who could be involved in violence in the lead-up to the g8 summit ? i think it is important to be very clear that the danger of the method is using it without having a concrete crime .
collecting samples on the suspicion that people could protest or offend in the future clearly harks back to stasi times , when security officials operated without any type of state limitation . in these times of the so-called war on terror , do you think the german state is going too far in its security activities ? the state has being going too far for a very long time - it 's just that now the issues surrounding the collection of scent samples are making this evident because here in germany , the stasi are so strongly associated with this particular method . if you take a look at what has happened here since sept 11. with new security laws , then we have to ask the question of how much freedom we want to sacrifice in the name of security .

it was a triumphant finale to a season which started with the club being docked eight points for their involvement in italy 's match-fixing scandal .
only a successful appeal against an initial , heavier , penalty enabled milan to enter the champions league at all , and they were forced to begin their campaign in the final qualifying round .
defying the odds " it is the greatest victory we have had , " ac milan coach carlo ancelotti said .
" few believed we could do it , but we have actually done something extraordinary that very few people , perhaps nobody , expected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool supporters dreams crushed in athens on wednesday .
liverpool 's chances of pulling a repeat of their 2005 victory over ancelotti 's men were dealt a severe blow by milan 's opening goal : an andrea pirlo free-kick that beat jose reina with the help of a deflection off inzaghi 's shoulder .
the striker had no hesitation in claiming the credit for the goal .
" of course we worked on that in training and sometimes it comes off , " he said , apparently tongue-in-cheek .
liverpool bruised , but gracious liverpool boss rafael benitez was enraged by the scarcity of extra time , but played down his touchline explosion afterwards .
" i do n't want to use this as an excuse , " the spaniard said .
" we were playing well until we conceded the first goal , and they have players with the quality to make the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final in athens : liverpool started out strong , but could n't match filippo inzaghi 's double strike .
" we were controlling the game , going forward and creating chances but we conceded a bad goal at a bad time , " benitez said .
line up changes failed with just under an hour gone , benitez introduced harry kewell .
but he proved no more effective than the man he replaced , bolo zenden .
the manager rejected suggestions he should have been bolder and started with the australian winger rather than packing five men across his midfield .
" kewell could not play a long time , he was ten months without playing , " benitez said . " milan are well organized in defence and good on counter attack .
when you try to attack , you have to keep a balance and not leave big spaces behind .
when you lose the balance against them they just need one opportunity and they will kill you . "
lucky opening goal ancelotti acknowledged that milan 's opening goal had been the lucky break his side needed against opponents who posed them far more problems than manchester united had in the semi-final .
" liverpool did not let us play the way we wanted in the first half , " ancelotti said .
" our midfielders were under pressure and we did not get the ball to kaka and clarence seedorf as much as we wanted . "
but he said this was a tough team and they had managed a difficult situation quite well . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milan face two opponents in liverpool and foolish revenge ac milan have waited two years to avenge the 2005 champions league final defeat to liverpool .

" a simplified treaty is the only way forwards , " sarkozy told reporters at the joint press conference .
on his second foreign trip after his inauguration last week , the french leader said he was determined to make sure that agreement was reached at the eu summit next month .
he underlined that it was crucial that the eu break its current deadlock after french and dutch voters rejected the draft eu constitution in referenda in 2005 .
" i am convinced that europe can not remain at a standstill .
we can not remain in this relative paralysis , " said sarkozy .
" we have to find a way out of this impasse , " he added .
slimline treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy clearly wants to put france back at the heart of europe the french president would like to see the streamlined document including provision for a permanent eu presidency to replace the current rotating one , possibilities for " enhanced cooperation " between eu states and a move from unanimity to majority voting .
immigration issues should also be covered by the new treaty , he said .
a new eu rulebook is needed to ensure efficient and rapid decision-making in a bloc which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states over recent years .
the french president emphasised that the scaled-down treaty should be agreed by the member states ' parliaments rather than being put to the people .
during a debate about the constitutional crisis in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said the concept of an " eu constitution " had put off many dutch voters who see the document as a threat to national sovereignty .
problematic symbol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is one of the dissenting voices in the debate " it is clear that the symbol of the constitution was an important reason for the no vote , " said balkenende .
he stressed the need for reform , but called for it to be achieved in small steps .
but some important european players reject the idea of scaling down the constitution .
italian prime minister romano prodi has attacked the idea of the french " mini-treaty " and threatened that a vanguard of european nations who want closer integration could go it alone .
germany , which currently holds the rotating six-month eu presidency , has also said repeatedly that it wants the " substance " of the constitution to be preserved and the charter of fundamental rights to be annexed to the new treaty .
chancellor angela merkel has made resurrecting the failed constitution a top priority .
at the eu summit in june she is expected to call on all governments to rally behind her proposals for a new " road map " for europe to be ratified before european parliament elections in summer 2009 . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy giant e.on drops bid for spanish utility ending a long battle , german energy giant e.on said monday it had abandoned its takeover bid for spanish power company endesa , but planned to buy assets from the group worth about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- .

so far , the rich g8 countries are not meeting their part of the bargain , despite endless words from the rich countries about increasing their aid to the poor countries . when new donor countries such as china enter the scene , the us and europe tend to complain , as if their monopoly over low-income africa and asia is being broken . the political standing of the g8 in the world will plummet if it is unable or unwilling to follow through on its word . though the g8 promised to double aid to africa at the 2005 gleneagles summit , there is no plan on how to do so . for the first year after gleneagles , the reported aid numbers were padded by misleading accounting on debt cancellation operations . with those debt cancellation operations largely completed , the data are now revealing the stark truth . development aid to africa , and to poor countries more generally , is stagnant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles 2005 - it is now time to fulfil those promises specifically , between 2005 and 2006 , overall aid to africa , excluding debt cancellation operations , showed a meager increase of 2 percent , far off track from a path of doubling aid . total official development assistance to all recipient countries , net of debt cancellation , actually declined by 2 percent between 2005 and 2006 . even the world bank , usually taking the donors ’ point of view , recently acknowledged that except for debt cancellation , “ promises of scaled up aid have not been delivered . ” all of this would seem to be insurmountable if the basic economics were not so clear . we are not talking about an unachievable amount of money from the rich countries . indeed what we are talking about is minuscule . the g8 , representing nearly 1 billion people in high-income countries , has promised to increase aid to africa from $ 25 billion in 2004 to $ 50 billion in 2010 . that $ 25 billion is less than one-tenth of one percent of the income of the rich donor world ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the christmas bonuses this year on wall street amounted to $ 24 billion " to put it in perspective , the christmas bonuses this year on wall street - just the bonuses - amounted to $ 24 billion ! the spending on the war in iraq , which accomplishes nothing but violence , is more than $ 100 billion per year . the g8 could easily honor its commitments , if the rich countries had the slightest concern to do so . to salvage the g8 ’ s dwindling credibility , here is what needs to be done . first , the g8 needs to make crystal clear that it will honor its commitment to increase aid to africa by $ 25 billion per year , so that total aid reaches $ 50 billion per year .
that way , the cynics within the g8 governments can understand their assignments . second , the g8 needs to put forward a plan of action . the lack of specific commitments by specific countries is shocking , and a display of governance at its poorest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " progress in the fight against poverty will contribute not only to survival and human dignity , but also to peace " third , the recipient countries need to be told of the year-to-year increases in aid that they can expect , so that they can plan ahead to the year 2010 . the increased aid should be directed at building roads , power grids , schools , and clinics , and at training teachers , doctors , and community health workers . yet all of that investment requires plans and years of implementation . aid needs to be committed in clear terms over a period of several years , so that recipient countries can use it sensibly and accountably . african countries have already identified their high-priority investments in health , education , agriculture , and infrastructure -lrb- including roads , power , and internet connectivity -rrb- . these investments could be increased systematically during the period from now until 2015 , in order to enable those countries to achieve the millennium development goals . it ’ s time for the rich countries to stop giving lectures to the poor , and instead to follow through on their own words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey sachs progress in the fight against poverty will contribute not only to survival and human dignity , but also to peace . it is time , therefore , to hold our governments accountable for what they have pledged but not delivered . professor jeffrey sachs is director of the earth institute at columbia university and special advisor to un secretary general ban ki-moon .

green campaigners want even greater support for renewables in the short term , that will mean a swifter streamlined planning process , a drive to capture maximum energy from stuff we throw away , more offshore renewable energy , and caps on co2 from big commercial firms .
in the medium term it possibly means more nuclear , although this is no foregone conclusion .
together these polices are designed to secure energy supplies before 2017 when nuclear power from existing stations runs down .
and it should keep the uk on track for its target of reducing carbon to 26-32 % below 1990 levels by 32 % by 2020 - but only if all the measures in this week 's plans are delivered .
' too timid ' government sources say this week 's announcements are not their last word .
they expect tougher targets on co2 in the next few years , thanks to international agreements .
environmentalists accuse the government of being far too timid .
they argue that given all its energy advantages the uk should be leading the world far more ambitiously to a low-carbon future .
they point out that high gas prices are driving generators towards coal , which is likely to push co2 emissions up , not down .
but all three of this week 's documents at least offer a pointer to gordon brown 's future britain .
much of the thinking was based on treasury-dominated reviews and they at least make an effort to reconcile some of the fiercely competing forces on the uk 's forces .
business delight critics argue the planning white paper is based on the false premise that delays in the planning system are making the uk uncompetitive .
this accusation was regularly levelled by the influential former cbi director digby jones , but the evidence appears scanty .
some government insiders believe ministers will be forced to take back responsibility for ultimate decisions on planning before any planning bill gets approved industrialists gaze longingly across the channel where french politicians generously strew nuclear stations , motorways and tgvs about .
the planning paper will make it easier in future for the uk to build large infrastructure projects like these - and wind farms .
ministers intend to pare down the planning system so ministers hold a national debate about policy then hand detailed decisions to an independent planning commission .
small household building schemes would no longer need planning permission if they did not impact on the neighbours .
this cutting of red tape has delighted business - and doubtless those wanting a roof extension , too - but green groups and civic groups fear that the new system has handed power to a quango from politicians and people .
ministers promise the public will be consulted intensely - but in abolishing the muddling anarchic planning enquiry system they have removed the most powerful weapon of ordinary people to embarrass or delay government policy .
some government insiders believe ministers will be forced to take back responsibility for ultimate decisions on planning before any planning bill gets approved .
the planning white paper puts carbon reductions at the heart of the planning process and obliges local councils to plan new buildings to optimise people 's ability to walk or cycle to work .
but the broad emphasis on competitiveness could herald a building bonanza for airports , ports and motorways that would all drive up carbon emissions .
it will be impossible to tell the government 's true direction until ministers have spelled out their planning statements for each specific sector .
nuclear debate if you listened to the exchanges in the commons you would have thought the energy white paper was a nuclear white paper .
tony blair made a passionate plea for more nuclear power to keep on the lights - and was berated by the conservatives ' alan duncan for failing to spell out a time-table for nuclear new-build .
a decision on nuclear may still be unclear by the end of the year the government , though , are tied by the recent high court judgment into delaying their policies until the autumn so they can fully consult .
but even then there are possibly insuperable problems with nuclear - particularly the promise from gordon brown of no nuclear subsidy .
no firm wants to build a nuclear plant unless they can get certainty over the premium that would be paid for low-carbon energy .
and the government will have difficulty in doing that while also adhering to its stated policy of a liberalised energy market .
so a decision on nuclear may still be unclear by the end of the year .
the white paper did offer more support for renewables , though not enough to satisfy green campaigners .
the government will switch its price support scheme so more goes to offshore wave and wind power which are expensive to produce .
this is a tacit admission that the previous government policy of leaving it up to the market to pick the future energy mix has failed to generate enough power from renewables - partly because of planning problems with onshore wind .
carbon storage other policies are designed to reduce our use of energy .
the scheme to cap emissions from big offices and supermarkets is intended to save 1m tonnes of carbon a year by 2020 .
the government admit meeting targets on traffic is a challenge it will cover only the very biggest emitters -lrb- like the bbc -rrb- - the dti blocked the scheme from extending further on the grounds that it would increase red tape .
householders should benefit too from government insistence that power firms double the amount of money they will spend on helping us to insulate our homes .
and new gadgets on offer to help us read our electricity use will help a little , too .
there was some progress on carbon capture and storage - but it is not happening fast enough for bp , who have withdrawn their offer to set up a carbon capture plant at peterhead , where they would have used to waste co2 to get drive out the last drops of oil from their offshore field .
the government said they ca n't rush the policy because it involves large public subsidy .
they still expect a carbon storage plant in the uk by around 2013 .
joined-up thinking the biggest hole in the white paper is on transport .
the government admits that meeting targets to reduce emissions from cars is a challenge - and international aviation maintains its blessed position exempt from carbon cuts .
the waste strategy will also have a bearing on future energy use - both actively and passively ministers appear to want cutting co2 to be politically painless , but sooner or later someone will have to take more controversial decisions .
if all the measures in the white paper were implemented they would help the government achieve their minimum target for cutting co2 between 26 % and 32 % by 2020 .
green groups say that given the failure to meet previous 2010 targets the government is still complacent on climate .
the government say new policies will follow in future .
the waste strategy will also have a bearing on future energy use - both actively and passively .
ministers aim to cut the amount of waste we produce -lrb- which will save energy -rrb- , then they want to increase the amount of energy we get from the waste stream by burning more waste and getting more methane by putting food waste through anaerobic digesters .
they also want to recover more waste for recycling - particularly aluminium - which will save even more energy .
all the signs are there of joined-up thinking across government on the challenges posed by energy security and climate change .
critics argue that they are not moving fast enough .

green campaigners want even greater support for renewables in the short term , that will mean a swifter streamlined planning process , a drive to capture maximum energy from stuff we throw away , more offshore renewable energy , and caps on co2 from big commercial firms .
in the medium term it possibly means more nuclear , although this is no foregone conclusion .
together these polices are designed to secure energy supplies before 2017 when nuclear power from existing stations runs down .
and it should keep the uk on track for its target of reducing carbon to 26-32 % below 1990 levels by 32 % by 2020 - but only if all the measures in this week 's plans are delivered .
' too timid ' government sources say this week 's announcements are not their last word .
they expect tougher targets on co2 in the next few years , thanks to international agreements .
environmentalists accuse the government of being far too timid .
they argue that given all its energy advantages the uk should be leading the world far more ambitiously to a low-carbon future .
they point out that high gas prices are driving generators towards coal , which is likely to push co2 emissions up , not down .
but all three of this week 's documents at least offer a pointer to gordon brown 's future britain .
much of the thinking was based on treasury-dominated reviews and they at least make an effort to reconcile some of the fiercely competing forces on the uk 's forces .
business delight critics argue the planning white paper is based on the false premise that delays in the planning system are making the uk uncompetitive .
this accusation was regularly levelled by the influential former cbi director digby jones , but the evidence appears scanty .
some government insiders believe ministers will be forced to take back responsibility for ultimate decisions on planning before any planning bill gets approved industrialists gaze longingly across the channel where french politicians generously strew nuclear stations , motorways and tgvs about .
the planning paper will make it easier in future for the uk to build large infrastructure projects like these - and wind farms .
ministers intend to pare down the planning system so ministers hold a national debate about policy then hand detailed decisions to an independent planning commission .
small household building schemes would no longer need planning permission if they did not impact on the neighbours .
this cutting of red tape has delighted business - and doubtless those wanting a roof extension , too - but green groups and civic groups fear that the new system has handed power to a quango from politicians and people .
ministers promise the public will be consulted intensely - but in abolishing the muddling anarchic planning enquiry system they have removed the most powerful weapon of ordinary people to embarrass or delay government policy .
some government insiders believe ministers will be forced to take back responsibility for ultimate decisions on planning before any planning bill gets approved .
the planning white paper puts carbon reductions at the heart of the planning process and obliges local councils to plan new buildings to optimise people 's ability to walk or cycle to work .
but the broad emphasis on competitiveness could herald a building bonanza for airports , ports and motorways that would all drive up carbon emissions .
it will be impossible to tell the government 's true direction until ministers have spelled out their planning statements for each specific sector .
nuclear debate if you listened to the exchanges in the commons you would have thought the energy white paper was a nuclear white paper .
tony blair made a passionate plea for more nuclear power to keep on the lights - and was berated by the conservatives ' alan duncan for failing to spell out a time-table for nuclear new-build .
a decision on nuclear may still be unclear by the end of the year the government , though , are tied by the recent high court judgment into delaying their policies until the autumn so they can fully consult .
but even then there are possibly insuperable problems with nuclear - particularly the promise from gordon brown of no nuclear subsidy .
no firm wants to build a nuclear plant unless they can get certainty over the premium that would be paid for low-carbon energy .
and the government will have difficulty in doing that while also adhering to its stated policy of a liberalised energy market .
so a decision on nuclear may still be unclear by the end of the year .
the white paper did offer more support for renewables , though not enough to satisfy green campaigners .
the government will switch its price support scheme so more goes to offshore wave and wind power which are expensive to produce .
this is a tacit admission that the previous government policy of leaving it up to the market to pick the future energy mix has failed to generate enough power from renewables - partly because of planning problems with onshore wind .
carbon storage other policies are designed to reduce our use of energy .
the scheme to cap emissions from big offices and supermarkets is intended to save 1m tonnes of carbon a year by 2020 .
the government admit meeting targets on traffic is a challenge it will cover only the very biggest emitters -lrb- like the bbc -rrb- - the dti blocked the scheme from extending further on the grounds that it would increase red tape .
householders should benefit too from government insistence that power firms double the amount of money they will spend on helping us to insulate our homes .
and new gadgets on offer to help us read our electricity use will help a little , too .
there was some progress on carbon capture and storage - but it is not happening fast enough for bp , who have withdrawn their offer to set up a carbon capture plant at peterhead , where they would have used to waste co2 to get drive out the last drops of oil from their offshore field .
the government said they ca n't rush the policy because it involves large public subsidy .
they still expect a carbon storage plant in the uk by around 2013 .
joined-up thinking the biggest hole in the white paper is on transport .
the government admits that meeting targets to reduce emissions from cars is a challenge - and international aviation maintains its blessed position exempt from carbon cuts .
the waste strategy will also have a bearing on future energy use - both actively and passively ministers appear to want cutting co2 to be politically painless , but sooner or later someone will have to take more controversial decisions .
if all the measures in the white paper were implemented they would help the government achieve their minimum target for cutting co2 between 26 % and 32 % by 2020 .
green groups say that given the failure to meet previous 2010 targets the government is still complacent on climate .
the government say new policies will follow in future .

green campaigners want even greater support for renewables in the short term , that will mean a swifter streamlined planning process , a drive to capture maximum energy from stuff we throw away , more offshore renewable energy , and caps on co2 from big commercial firms .
in the medium term it possibly means more nuclear , although this is no foregone conclusion .
together these polices are designed to secure energy supplies before 2017 when nuclear power from existing stations runs down .
and it should keep the uk on track for its target of reducing carbon to 26-32 % below 1990 levels by 32 % by 2020 - but only if all the measures in this week 's plans are delivered .
' too timid ' government sources say this week 's announcements are not their last word .
they expect tougher targets on co2 in the next few years , thanks to international agreements .
environmentalists accuse the government of being far too timid .
they argue that given all its energy advantages the uk should be leading the world far more ambitiously to a low-carbon future .
they point out that high gas prices are driving generators towards coal , which is likely to push co2 emissions up , not down .
but all three of this week 's documents at least offer a pointer to gordon brown 's future britain .
much of the thinking was based on treasury-dominated reviews and they at least make an effort to reconcile some of the fiercely competing forces on the uk 's forces .
business delight critics argue the planning white paper is based on the false premise that delays in the planning system are making the uk uncompetitive .
this accusation was regularly levelled by the influential former cbi director digby jones , but the evidence appears scanty .
some government insiders believe ministers will be forced to take back responsibility for ultimate decisions on planning before any planning bill gets approved industrialists gaze longingly across the channel where french politicians generously strew nuclear stations , motorways and tgvs about .
the planning paper will make it easier in future for the uk to build large infrastructure projects like these - and wind farms .
ministers intend to pare down the planning system so ministers hold a national debate about policy then hand detailed decisions to an independent planning commission .
small household building schemes would no longer need planning permission if they did not impact on the neighbours .
this cutting of red tape has delighted business - and doubtless those wanting a roof extension , too - but green groups and civic groups fear that the new system has handed power to a quango from politicians and people .
ministers promise the public will be consulted intensely - but in abolishing the muddling anarchic planning enquiry system they have removed the most powerful weapon of ordinary people to embarrass or delay government policy .
some government insiders believe ministers will be forced to take back responsibility for ultimate decisions on planning before any planning bill gets approved .
the planning white paper puts carbon reductions at the heart of the planning process and obliges local councils to plan new buildings to optimise people 's ability to walk or cycle to work .
but the broad emphasis on competitiveness could herald a building bonanza for airports , ports and motorways that would all drive up carbon emissions .
it will be impossible to tell the government 's true direction until ministers have spelled out their planning statements for each specific sector .
nuclear debate if you listened to the exchanges in the commons you would have thought the energy white paper was a nuclear white paper .
tony blair made a passionate plea for more nuclear power to keep on the lights - and was berated by the conservatives ' alan duncan for failing to spell out a time-table for nuclear new-build .

philippa lawrence aims to decorate trees in each of the 13 old counties of wales as part of a scheme called bound .
originally planned as a one-off piece for the national botanic garden of wales , bound expanded across wales .
photographs of each of the nine trees completed so far are on display at the glynn vivian gallery in swansea .
ms lawrence , who is a senior lecturer at university of wales institute , cardiff -lrb- uwic -rrb- , travelled the country looking for majestic dead trees in sites which could be seen from paths or roads .
she contacted landowners to seek permission and then spent days at a time wrapping the trees in dyed material .
i also wanted to make people appreciate again something that they do see everyday philippa lawrence suitable trees were found and wrapped in the old counties of anglesey , brecknockshire , cardiganshire , carmarthenshire , denbighshire , glamorgan , monmouthshire , montgomeryshire and radnorshire .
she is still planning to find trees in caernarvonshire , flintshire , merioneth and pembrokeshire to complete the bound project and is hoping sales of the two metre-high prints displayed in the exhibition will help to fund it .
bound was originally funded by a £ 10,000 grant from the arts council of wales ' annual creative wales awards but this money has now run out .
one of the most prominent trees was located next to the a48 on the outskirts of cardiff .
it was wrapped in pale blue cloth and had red tips and could be seen from the roadside for a year .
the bound project also saw a tree wrapped in red cotton voile at llanyre , near llandrindod wells .
another in the conwy valley was wrapped in yellow paper , while the tree at the national botanic garden of wales was covered in white bandages .
this tree at the national botanic garden was wrapped in white bandages " i 'd always been very interested in making art work outside of the public gallery spaces , " said ms lawrence , 39 , who trained in fine art printmaking at the royal college of art in london .
" i also wanted to make people appreciate again something that they do see every day .
" but it was also always my promise to the landowner to change the trees back to their previous state . "
ms lawrence said she did not actively publicise any part of the project while she was working on it because she liked people to discover and speculate on the trees themselves .
the images of the trees will be exhibited alongside ms lawrence 's other works , including a dead bonsai tree wrapped in coloured thread .
the exhibition at the glynn vivian gallery runs until 8 july .

among the deals agreed were an increase in us flights to china and improved access to chinese financial markets .
us treasury secretary henry paulson welcomed " tangible results " achieved at the two-day meeting in washington .
chinese vice premier wu yi said the talks were a success , but warned that " complicated " relations between the two needed careful handling .
currency concerns little progress was made on the key issue of the value of the yuan at the washington meeting .
us firms have accused china of keeping the yuan low to boost exports , thus threatening american jobs - and the us congress is backing their claims .
there is bipartisan sentiment in congress that we are not being tough enough congressman tim ryan while the two sides failed to make any headway , mr paulson told reporters he had pressed beijing for greater flexibility for the currency .
" this is an important area and they agree with us in principle , " he said .
" the pace of change is picked up but i believe it would be very much in their best interests and the rest of the world 's best interests for them to move more quickly . "
mr paulson pointed to china 's recent decision to allow the yuan to appreciate each day from 0.3 % to 0.5 % as an " important signal " that change may be in store .
congressional pressures but his comments did not assuage us lawmakers who are currently considering legislation to impose tariffs on chinese imports unless the country allows the yuan to appreciate more quickly .
us politicians say china has a huge currency advantage some congressmen say the yuan should be revalued by up to 40 % , arguing that it has fuelled the country 's growing trade deficit with china , which hit a record $ 233bn last year .
following a meeting with chinese vice premier wu yi , speaker of the house of representatives nancy pelosi said she believed china could " do more " on the issue .
" there is bipartisan sentiment in congress that we are not being tough enough , " added tim ryan , a democrat congressman from ohio .
chinese officials said the value of the yuan must reflect the country 's key economic and social priorities .
" they may think we can accelerate the speed of reform but we think that we already try our best and domestically we have pressure to slow down , " said zhou xiaochuan , head of china 's central bank .
both countries facing growing political pressures , with the us presidential election looming in 2008 , and china holding its first national people 's congress in five years in october .
more flights among the deals agreed by the two sides during the talks , the most significant was one that requires china to ease limits on foreign investment in the country .
the move should remove a bar on new foreign securities firms in china and allow foreign firms to expand their operations there .
daily us flights to china will double over the next five years the limit on the amount of chinese shares that foreign investors can buy will be raised from $ 10bn to $ 30bn in the future .
meanwhile a further deal on the aviation sector should lead to a doubling in passenger flights between the two countries while cargo firms should have almost unlimited access to china .
by 2012 , us carriers will be able to operate 23 daily flights - up from 10 currently - with chinese airlines being allowed equivalent services .
us transportation secretary mary peters hailed the deal as a " breakthrough agreement " which would enable more frequent and cheaper travel between the two countries .

hinkley point , in somerset , is the best place to build a new nuclear power station , according to a confidential report commissioned by ministers .
it lists 14 suitable sites around the uk but says existing nuclear plants in southern england are the best choice .
it also reveals the first uk nuclear reactor was sited at harwell , in oxfordshire , in the late 1940s , because it was " a pleasant place to live " .
the government stressed the report was a " discussion paper only " .
independent consultants drew up a list of the most suitable sites for new nuclear plants , based on the criteria that existing nuclear power stations were the most suitable for development .
the report sets out the " major business , economic , safety , environmental and technical factors that could influence the selection of a site " .
' feasibility ' it says there would be " little point " in the government considering nuclear power if no suitable sites were to become available .

trawsfynydd source : jackson consulting report , april 2006 " the availability of potential sites will therefore directly affect the government 's view of the overall feasibility of a new nuclear build programme , " the report adds .
hinkley point was deemed the most suitable , with only planning consent for an additional power line and possible conflict with a nearby wind farm standing in the way of development .
it was also available for new development " now , " the document says .
global warming sizewell , in suffolk , is seen as the next most suitable , only needing planning permission for power lines and " investigation of grid stability " .
areas offering ' key opportunities for nuclear development in uk ' enlarge map the least suitable of the 14 listed was trawsfynydd , in wales , which uses a large man-made reservoir to cool its reactor .
but its inland location may prove attractive if the government decides global warming is a major factor in the siting decision - it has said rising sea levels could make coastal sites unsuitable over the 100-year lifespan of a nuclear plant .

scotland 's first minister , alex salmond has said there is " no chance " of any nuclear power plants being built in scotland , setting up the prospect of a showdown between westminster and holyrood .
consultation the siting report was produced by jackson consulting in april 2006 for the department of trade and industry -lrb- dti -rrb- , which published it on wednesday as a supporting document to its energy white paper .
it should be not too far from london , there should be easy access to a university ; there should be some degree of isolation sir john cockcroft , 1948 article on siting nuclear reactor the government is planning its own investigation into suitable locations for nuclear reactors , which will be launched in 2008 - if the government decides to back nuclear power .
launching the white paper on wednesday , trade secretary alistair darling said his " preliminary view " was to allow more nuclear plants , but there would be a five-month consultation period .
there will be a separate consultation on the criteria used for choosing the location of new reactors .
if the government decides to back nuclear power , it will carry out a strategic siting assessment -lrb- ssa -rrb- to identify the best sites in the uk for new nuclear plants .
the government says the ssa will speed up the planning process as it will " deal with siting matters that are sufficiently generic for them to be sensibly addressed nationally " .
wildlife habitats local people will still be able to object to the building of new nuclear power plants - but only on strictly local grounds , such as noise and traffic problems .
they will not be able to object on wider environmental grounds - such as the potential effects of radiation and nuclear waste .
european legislation protecting wildlife habitats must also be met .
but the issue of whether a particular location is the most suitable place to build a nuclear reactor will be off limits as it will already have been decided by the ssa .
critics say the government has caved in to pressure from the nuclear industry , which has lobbied for the planning process to be streamlined .
but the government says it wants to avoid lengthy and expensive public inquiries , citing the sizewell b inquiry which it said cost £ 30m and only 30 of 340 days devoted to local issues .
airfield sites the jackson consulting report also reveals the department of trade and industry has been working on the policy planning assumption that 10 new reactors will be built .
the government has stressed the actual number of new reactors will be decided by the nuclear industry , which may decide not to build any at all .
the report also reprints an article first published in 1948 by sir john cockcroft , on how the decision was reached to site britain 's first nuclear reactors at harwell , in oxfordshire .
" we considered the desirable location for the future establishment .
it should be not too far from london , there should be easy access to a university ; there should be some degree of isolation and lastly the countryside should be pleasant to live in , " wrote sir john .
after a brief tour of airfield sites , a shortlist was drawn up and harwell was chosen as the site for the atomic energy research establishment .
britain 's first military reactor was sited in a more remote location , at windscale , now sellafield , in cumbria , in 1947 , using a us siting system which said it should be 25 miles from any town of 10,000 people or more .

the wildlife institute of india census showed tiger numbers falling in some states by two-thirds in five years .
a final report is due out in december .
india 's last major survey in 2002 put tiger numbers at 3,500 .
that was far too optimistic , say conservationists .
they blame poaching and urbanisation for the decline and say the authorities must do more before time runs out .
a century ago india was believed to have tens of thousands of tigers .
' depressing ' the new survey , conducted over two years , was the most ambitious ever undertaken to try to stem the decline in the population of india 's tigers .
it found the largest decline in the tiger population to be in the central state of madhya pradesh , where the number of big cats has gone down from 710 to 255 in the past five years .
tiger skins and other body parts sell for thousands of dollars " the figures are quite different from what we have seen earlier , " said mr rajesh gopal , secretary general of the government 's tiger conservation authority of india , which also took part in the survey .
mr gopal said the new study was far more detailed than any previous research .
results are available only for some regions and a total overall figure is not expected until later this year .
but conservationists say the 2002 census badly overestimated tiger number .
wildlife experts have criticised the indian government for failing to crack down on poachers and the illegal trade in tiger skins .
" the results are depressing , " belinda wright , director of the wildlife protection society of india , told the associated press news agency .
" but it 's a major step forward that a government study has finally come to terms with this disastrous decrease in tiger numbers , " she said .
pricey pelts according to reports , there were 40,000 tigers in india a century ago .
the country is home to 40 % of the world 's tigers , with 23 tiger reserves in 17 states .
tigers are poached for their body parts - skins are prized for fashion and tiger bones are used for oriental medicines .
tiger pelts can fetch up to $ 12,500 in china .
some conservationists say forest officials often inflate the number of sightings to paint a rosy picture of how india 's tigers are surviving .

the wildlife institute of india census showed tiger numbers falling in some states by two-thirds in five years .
a final report is due out in december .
india 's last major survey in 2002 put tiger numbers at 3,500 .
that was far too optimistic , say conservationists .
they blame poaching and urbanisation for the decline and say the authorities must do more before time runs out .
a century ago india was believed to have tens of thousands of tigers .
' depressing ' the new survey , conducted over two years , was the most ambitious ever undertaken to try to stem the decline in the population of india 's tigers .
it found the largest decline in the tiger population to be in the central state of madhya pradesh , where the number of big cats has gone down from 710 to 255 in the past five years .
tiger skins and other body parts sell for thousands of dollars " the figures are quite different from what we have seen earlier , " said mr rajesh gopal , secretary general of the government 's tiger conservation authority of india , which also took part in the survey .
mr gopal said the new study was far more detailed than any previous research .
results are available only for some regions and a total overall figure is not expected until later this year .
but conservationists say the 2002 census badly overestimated tiger number .
wildlife experts have criticised the indian government for failing to crack down on poachers and the illegal trade in tiger skins .
" the results are depressing , " belinda wright , director of the wildlife protection society of india , told the associated press news agency .
" but it 's a major step forward that a government study has finally come to terms with this disastrous decrease in tiger numbers , " she said .
pricey pelts according to reports , there were 40,000 tigers in india a century ago .
the country is home to 40 % of the world 's tigers , with 23 tiger reserves in 17 states .
tigers are poached for their body parts - skins are prized for fashion and tiger bones are used for oriental medicines .
tiger pelts can fetch up to $ 12,500 in china .
some conservationists say forest officials often inflate the number of sightings to paint a rosy picture of how india 's tigers are surviving .

stroud mayor john marjoram hopes local shopkeepers will follow the example of modbury in devon where all 43 traders signed up to the scheme .
it followed a campaign by a bbc wildlife camerawoman who captured horrific images of marine life choking on plastic bags in hawaii .
green councillor marjoram said he would urge traders to opt for reusable bags .
' killing wildlife ' " what we really need is a cultural shift away from the throwaway society , " he said .
" about 1m seabirds choke or get tangled in plastic nets and other debris every year .
" this -lsb- plastic bag -rsb- has got a shelf life of 12 minutes and then it 's thrown away .
but you could actually make it last for 10 years .
" this is killing wildlife , but once people are aware of the significance of their plastic bags , they 'll start being much more conscious about whether to use them . "
camerawoman rebecca hosking , who began the modbury campaign , said : " the way we did it here was to work as a community .
" i started with friends first , traders i knew .
i gave them facts and figures , i started talking to them , showing them the film and giving them the facts .
" once i got a certain amount of traders ' support , i organised an evening . "
modbury 's traders and shopkeepers are now using large reusable cotton and jute bags , smaller 100 % biodegradable cornstarch bags and recyclable paper bags .

the statistics - gathered following freedom of information inquiries to local authorities - showed reported incidents were rising sharply .
in the 2004/5 school year , 610 attacks were reported for notts , leics , lincs and derbys increasing to 901 in 2005/6 .
peter flack from the national union of teachers said figures were worrying .
' challenging behaviour ' " we have a number of members where we 've had to advise them that they need to go and see their doctor because it was quite clear that the situation in their school was making them ill , " said mr flack .
" i 'm absolutely certain this is getting worse .
the reports we get from schools demonstrate this to us .
" even the schools that are the most successful and have very good behaviour policies , they are facing increasing problems with challenging behaviour . "
one teacher who wanted to be identified only as " monica " said she had been assaulted several times .
punching and kicking " i was kicked and that sort of thing , spat on and one day i went over to the desk drawer and saw a pen knife .
the pupil picked it up and said ' i 'm going to get you now ' . "
incidents reported to local authorities included punching , kicking , spitting and possession of weapons .
injuries were quite rare but some teachers needed hospital treatment .
the information showed if the current rate of assaults on teachers continued , the figure for this academic year would be close to 2,000 by the summer holidays .

" every single employee at network rail has paid a personal price for the grayrigg derailment , " its chairman ian mcallister said .
senior executives ' bonuses have been cut by an extra 15 % .
a virgin pendolino tilting train from london to glasgow crashed in cumbria on 23 february .
network rail has apologised for the accident and said it is still trying identify the causes of the derailment , which killed an elderly woman and left several other people seriously injured .
network rail 's annual staff bonuses depend on the company meeting certain targets , including safety .
punctuality improved last year , the total bonus pot was £ 30m with everyone in the company receiving at least £ 900 .
this year that has been reduced to £ 10m with a minimum level of £ 400 .
annual bonuses for senior executives have been boosted by a three-year rolling incentive scheme with separate targets . "
it would have been more dignified for network rail directors to take a much lower bonus , if they took one at all . "
nina bawden , widow of potters bar crash victim q & a : network rail that means that while chief executive john armitt has had his annual bonus cut to £ 88,740 from last year 's £ 240,408 , he has received £ 112,320 for meeting targets on cost-cutting and punctuality .
network rail says that train punctuality is at its highest level since 1999 , with 88.1 % of trains arriving on time .
" more respectful " some people think that network rail executives have still received excessive bonuses for a year in which there has been a fatal crash .
nina bawden , whose husband austen kark was killed in the 2002 potters bar rail crash , said : " it would have been more dignified for network rail directors to take a much lower bonus , if they took one at all . "
" it would also have been more respectful to those killed , injured and bereaved by rail crashes , " she added .
but mr mcallister said the railway network was safer now than it had ever been .
the announcement of bonus levels came with the release of results for the not-for-dividend company .
it made a £ 1.48bn profit before tax for the year to the end of march , compared with a £ 232m loss the previous year .
network rail said the profit had already been used to help fund its £ 3.3bn investment programme .
