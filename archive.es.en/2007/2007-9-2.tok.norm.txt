this can have devastating effects on their lives . gerhard müllner is the head of " pänz im veedel " -lrb- cologne dialect for " children in the neighborhood " -rrb- , an association made up of social workers and teachers working with some of cologne 's most deprived children . müllner is also in charge of the escher street day-care center in cologne , where he comes face to face with children directly suffering the effects of poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müllner worries about many of the kids he works with " we 've found that many children do n't have lunch , " müllner said .
" instead , they are given about a euro and then they run to the nearest kiosk to buy sweets or chips .
it 's not such much that they are eating the wrong food , but rather that are n't getting enough to eat . " children under 15 years in a family living from social welfare payments receive only an estimated 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- per day for food . a recent study by the research institute for child nutrition in bonn concluded that " even those who buy only at discount stores need to spend 4.68 euros daily in order to satisfy the appetite of a teenager with reasonable food . " one of pänz im veedel 's many activities is to subsidize lunch fees for needy kids . the eight-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter of aische bastürk -lsb- name changed -rsb- , a kurd , are just two of those who benefit from the association 's lunch program . migrants hard hit by poverty it 's estimated that some 30 percent of germany 's immigrants fall under the poverty line .
bastürk has been unemployed since she lost her job as a cashier shortly before christmas .
her family receives 600 euros in welfare payments , while her husband brings in 500 euros working as a waiter in a turkish fast food restaurant . according to bastürk , it just is n't enough .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school brings extra costs " i ca n't do anything with my children ; i ca n't even take them to the movies , " she said .
" my son would love to go to the cinema , but we just ca n't afford it .
i ca n't even afford a mcdonald 's meal for my children .
we have a lot of debt , and all of that has to be paid off . " schooling expensive , too it 's not just food that 's a problem though - finding the money for school materials is also a burden . " my daughter 's book fees were 40 euros , and then she needed things like exercise books , drawing equipment , art lessons and so on , " bastürk said .
" eighty euros disappeared just like that .
then there were also my son 's book fees - they were 100 euros . " child poverty rates in germany have drifted upwards since the beginning of 1990s .
christian butterwegge , a political science professor at cologne university , has conducted several studies into the effects of child poverty .
he says that 17 percent of germany 's 11.4 million children in germany live in households dependent on social welfare . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 1.9 million children in germany live in poverty in some regions of the country , this statistic is even higher ; in görlitz , a town near germany 's border with poland , 44 percent of children fall into this category . the benefits are n't high by anyone 's standards .
families receive monthly payments of 347 euros per adult and 208 euros per child under 16 . no birthday present this year , aische bastürk did n't even have enough money for a birthday party for her daughter . " i asked myself , ' how can you explain your actions to your daughter , " ' bastürk said .
" in the end , i took her aside , and talked to her like she was a grown woman .
she reacted so well .
i said , ' darling , i can make you a cake , but i ca n't do more . '
she hugged me and said , ' mom , i 'm just happy to have you , so that can be the celebration . " ' daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gabriel had said the reactors ' permits to produce a certain amount of electricity could be transferred to newer plants .
" it 's not about old or new , but about safe or not , " pofalla said on zdf television .
he added that there was no reason to believe that the older plants did not meet the necessary safety standards .
gabriel had said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that shutting down the plants would " significantly lower the general nuclear risk . "
he pointed to recent incidents at the krümmel and brunsbüttel plants .
the plants had to be shut down in june after problems occurred outside of the reactors .
subsequently , the authorities discovered additional problems in both places .
gabriel said that although the incidents had n't posed an immediate danger to people 's safety , they showed the " vulnerability of complex nuclear technology . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has irritated nulcear power proponents his suggestions to transfer permits to newer reactors could result in only 10 of germany 's 17 reactors being in use by 2009 , with the last one out of commission in 2023 , the paper calculated .
the nuclear phase-out germany agreed upon under former chancellor gerhard schröder 's government of social democrats and greens would result in the last reactor being shut down in 2020 .
industry dismissive germany 's nuclear industry dismissed gabriel 's comments , the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote in its monday edition .
what was necessary was to discuss finding the right mixture of energy and what power sources would be needed in the future , it quoted an unnamed industry insider as saying .
" if there was a genuine safety problem , mr. gabriel would have had to shut down the plants a long time ago , " the person said .
energy companies active in germany have applied to transfer permits for energy production from new to old plants , but none have been filed to shift the permits from old to new plants , according to the süddeutsche zeitung .
the nuclear industry continues to push for germany to reverse its decision to phase out nuclear power .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , too , would prefer for germany to stick with nuclear energy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the protection and surveillance zone , set-up as a standard short-term measure to prevent the spread of the disease , has two areas ; an initial three-kilometer -lrb- 1.9-mile -rrb- protection radius which is classified as a high-risk area -lrb- zone a -rrb- , and a 10-kilometer surveillance low-risk buffer zone -lrb- zone b -rrb- which separates the whole area from disease-free parts of germany .
at present , strict movement controls are in place for poultry inside the high-risk area .
poultry must be kept indoors and gatherings of birds are banned .
after the outbreak , veterinary experts at the european commission approved the german measures .
" the commission has examined those measures in collaboration with germany , and is satisfied that the borders of areas a and b ... are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak , " a notice published on tuesday in the latest edition of the eu 's official journal said .
" areas a and b in germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalization fixed , " it said .
eu vets representing the bloc 's 27 member states will now meet to assess developments in bavaria and reassess the poultry protection measures in place .
this is expected later in the week .
threat assessment expected in first week of september bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts will check the quarantine measures " there is one -lsb- meeting -rsb- foreseen in early september but the date has not yet been fixed , " a commission official said in an interview with reuters .
" it would be a question of revisiting the commission decision and if necessary adapting the zones ... or making any adaptations that may be necessary if the situation evolves . "
the death of more than 400 ducks from the 170,000-strong flock in a short period alerted the farm to the possibility of a bird flu outbreak .
the outbreak was probably more widespread and of longer duration than first thought , veterinary officials admitted after analyzing the data from the bavarian farm .
examination of birds destroyed to contain the outbreak revealed that ducks from two other enclosures other than the one where the outbreak was first found had been infected , ottmar fick , head of the local veterinary authority said .
fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .
not all waterfowl suffered acute symptoms from the virus , and the incubation period could drag on over weeks , fick said .
he added that it was not clear whether infected birds had been offered for sale commercially .
" we can not exclude delivery , " fick said .
following the discovery , the remainder of the flock at the farm was destroyed .
the h5n1 strain of avian influenza is fatal to humans but can not be transferred between humans .

gabriel had said the reactors ' permits to produce a certain amount of electricity could be transferred to newer plants .
" it 's not about old or new , but about safe or not , " pofalla said on zdf television .
he added that there was no reason to believe that the older plants did not meet the necessary safety standards .
gabriel had said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that shutting down the plants would " significantly lower the general nuclear risk . "
he pointed to recent incidents at the krümmel and brunsbüttel plants .
the plants had to be shut down in june after problems occurred outside of the reactors .

energy companies active in germany have applied to transfer permits for energy production from new to old plants , but none have been filed to shift the permits from old to new plants , according to the süddeutsche zeitung .

this can have devastating effects on their lives . gerhard müllner is the head of " pänz im veedel " -lrb- cologne dialect for " children in the neighborhood " -rrb- , an association made up of social workers and teachers working with some of cologne 's most deprived children . müllner is also in charge of the escher street day-care center in cologne , where he comes face to face with children directly suffering the effects of poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müllner worries about many of the kids he works with " we 've found that many children do n't have lunch , " müllner said .
" instead , they are given about a euro and then they run to the nearest kiosk to buy sweets or chips .
it 's not such much that they are eating the wrong food , but rather that are n't getting enough to eat . " children under 15 years in a family living from social welfare payments receive only an estimated 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- per day for food . a recent study by the research institute for child nutrition in bonn concluded that " even those who buy only at discount stores need to spend 4.68 euros daily in order to satisfy the appetite of a teenager with reasonable food . " one of pänz im veedel 's many activities is to subsidize lunch fees for needy kids . the eight-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter of aische bastürk -lsb- name changed -rsb- , a kurd , are just two of those who benefit from the association 's lunch program . migrants hard hit by poverty it 's estimated that some 30 percent of germany 's immigrants fall under the poverty line .
bastürk has been unemployed since she lost her job as a cashier shortly before christmas .
her family receives 600 euros in welfare payments , while her husband brings in 500 euros working as a waiter in a turkish fast food restaurant . according to bastürk , it just is n't enough .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school brings extra costs " i ca n't do anything with my children ; i ca n't even take them to the movies , " she said .
" my son would love to go to the cinema , but we just ca n't afford it .
i ca n't even afford a mcdonald 's meal for my children .
we have a lot of debt , and all of that has to be paid off . " schooling expensive , too it 's not just food that 's a problem though - finding the money for school materials is also a burden . " my daughter 's book fees were 40 euros , and then she needed things like exercise books , drawing equipment , art lessons and so on , " bastürk said .
" eighty euros disappeared just like that .
then there were also my son 's book fees - they were 100 euros . " child poverty rates in germany have drifted upwards since the beginning of 1990s .
christian butterwegge , a political science professor at cologne university , has conducted several studies into the effects of child poverty .
he says that 17 percent of germany 's 11.4 million children in germany live in households dependent on social welfare . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 1.9 million children in germany live in poverty in some regions of the country , this statistic is even higher ; in görlitz , a town near germany 's border with poland , 44 percent of children fall into this category . the benefits are n't high by anyone 's standards .
families receive monthly payments of 347 euros per adult and 208 euros per child under 16 . no birthday present this year , aische bastürk did n't even have enough money for a birthday party for her daughter . " i asked myself , ' how can you explain your actions to your daughter , " ' bastürk said .
" in the end , i took her aside , and talked to her like she was a grown woman .
she reacted so well .
i said , ' darling , i can make you a cake , but i ca n't do more . '
she hugged me and said , ' mom , i 'm just happy to have you , so that can be the celebration . " ' daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the protection and surveillance zone , set-up as a standard short-term measure to prevent the spread of the disease , has two areas ; an initial three-kilometer -lrb- 1.9-mile -rrb- protection radius which is classified as a high-risk area -lrb- zone a -rrb- , and a 10-kilometer surveillance low-risk buffer zone -lrb- zone b -rrb- which separates the whole area from disease-free parts of germany .
at present , strict movement controls are in place for poultry inside the high-risk area .
poultry must be kept indoors and gatherings of birds are banned .
after the outbreak , veterinary experts at the european commission approved the german measures .
" the commission has examined those measures in collaboration with germany , and is satisfied that the borders of areas a and b ... are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak , " a notice published on tuesday in the latest edition of the eu 's official journal said .
" areas a and b in germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalization fixed , " it said .
eu vets representing the bloc 's 27 member states will now meet to assess developments in bavaria and reassess the poultry protection measures in place .
this is expected later in the week .

" it would be a question of revisiting the commission decision and if necessary adapting the zones ... or making any adaptations that may be necessary if the situation evolves . "
the death of more than 400 ducks from the 170,000-strong flock in a short period alerted the farm to the possibility of a bird flu outbreak .
the outbreak was probably more widespread and of longer duration than first thought , veterinary officials admitted after analyzing the data from the bavarian farm .
examination of birds destroyed to contain the outbreak revealed that ducks from two other enclosures other than the one where the outbreak was first found had been infected , ottmar fick , head of the local veterinary authority said .
fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .
not all waterfowl suffered acute symptoms from the virus , and the incubation period could drag on over weeks , fick said .
he added that it was not clear whether infected birds had been offered for sale commercially .
" we can not exclude delivery , " fick said .
following the discovery , the remainder of the flock at the farm was destroyed .

gabriel had said the reactors ' permits to produce a certain amount of electricity could be transferred to newer plants .
" it 's not about old or new , but about safe or not , " pofalla said on zdf television .
he added that there was no reason to believe that the older plants did not meet the necessary safety standards .
gabriel had said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that shutting down the plants would " significantly lower the general nuclear risk . "
he pointed to recent incidents at the krümmel and brunsbüttel plants .
the plants had to be shut down in june after problems occurred outside of the reactors .
subsequently , the authorities discovered additional problems in both places .
gabriel said that although the incidents had n't posed an immediate danger to people 's safety , they showed the " vulnerability of complex nuclear technology . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has irritated nulcear power proponents his suggestions to transfer permits to newer reactors could result in only 10 of germany 's 17 reactors being in use by 2009 , with the last one out of commission in 2023 , the paper calculated .
the nuclear phase-out germany agreed upon under former chancellor gerhard schröder 's government of social democrats and greens would result in the last reactor being shut down in 2020 .
industry dismissive germany 's nuclear industry dismissed gabriel 's comments , the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote in its monday edition .
what was necessary was to discuss finding the right mixture of energy and what power sources would be needed in the future , it quoted an unnamed industry insider as saying .
" if there was a genuine safety problem , mr. gabriel would have had to shut down the plants a long time ago , " the person said .
energy companies active in germany have applied to transfer permits for energy production from new to old plants , but none have been filed to shift the permits from old to new plants , according to the süddeutsche zeitung .
the nuclear industry continues to push for germany to reverse its decision to phase out nuclear power .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , too , would prefer for germany to stick with nuclear energy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the protection and surveillance zone , set-up as a standard short-term measure to prevent the spread of the disease , has two areas ; an initial three-kilometer -lrb- 1.9-mile -rrb- protection radius which is classified as a high-risk area -lrb- zone a -rrb- , and a 10-kilometer surveillance low-risk buffer zone -lrb- zone b -rrb- which separates the whole area from disease-free parts of germany .
at present , strict movement controls are in place for poultry inside the high-risk area .
poultry must be kept indoors and gatherings of birds are banned .
after the outbreak , veterinary experts at the european commission approved the german measures .
" the commission has examined those measures in collaboration with germany , and is satisfied that the borders of areas a and b ... are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak , " a notice published on tuesday in the latest edition of the eu 's official journal said .
" areas a and b in germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalization fixed , " it said .
eu vets representing the bloc 's 27 member states will now meet to assess developments in bavaria and reassess the poultry protection measures in place .
this is expected later in the week .
threat assessment expected in first week of september bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts will check the quarantine measures " there is one -lsb- meeting -rsb- foreseen in early september but the date has not yet been fixed , " a commission official said in an interview with reuters .
" it would be a question of revisiting the commission decision and if necessary adapting the zones ... or making any adaptations that may be necessary if the situation evolves . "
the death of more than 400 ducks from the 170,000-strong flock in a short period alerted the farm to the possibility of a bird flu outbreak .
the outbreak was probably more widespread and of longer duration than first thought , veterinary officials admitted after analyzing the data from the bavarian farm .
examination of birds destroyed to contain the outbreak revealed that ducks from two other enclosures other than the one where the outbreak was first found had been infected , ottmar fick , head of the local veterinary authority said .
fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .
not all waterfowl suffered acute symptoms from the virus , and the incubation period could drag on over weeks , fick said .
he added that it was not clear whether infected birds had been offered for sale commercially .
" we can not exclude delivery , " fick said .
following the discovery , the remainder of the flock at the farm was destroyed .
the h5n1 strain of avian influenza is fatal to humans but can not be transferred between humans .
it has hit wild water-birds and some domestic poultry in other parts of germany this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gabriel had said the reactors ' permits to produce a certain amount of electricity could be transferred to newer plants .
" it 's not about old or new , but about safe or not , " pofalla said on zdf television .
he added that there was no reason to believe that the older plants did not meet the necessary safety standards .
gabriel had said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that shutting down the plants would " significantly lower the general nuclear risk . "
he pointed to recent incidents at the krümmel and brunsbüttel plants .
the plants had to be shut down in june after problems occurred outside of the reactors .
subsequently , the authorities discovered additional problems in both places .
gabriel said that although the incidents had n't posed an immediate danger to people 's safety , they showed the " vulnerability of complex nuclear technology . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has irritated nulcear power proponents his suggestions to transfer permits to newer reactors could result in only 10 of germany 's 17 reactors being in use by 2009 , with the last one out of commission in 2023 , the paper calculated .
the nuclear phase-out germany agreed upon under former chancellor gerhard schröder 's government of social democrats and greens would result in the last reactor being shut down in 2020 .
industry dismissive germany 's nuclear industry dismissed gabriel 's comments , the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote in its monday edition .

the protection and surveillance zone , set-up as a standard short-term measure to prevent the spread of the disease , has two areas ; an initial three-kilometer -lrb- 1.9-mile -rrb- protection radius which is classified as a high-risk area -lrb- zone a -rrb- , and a 10-kilometer surveillance low-risk buffer zone -lrb- zone b -rrb- which separates the whole area from disease-free parts of germany .
at present , strict movement controls are in place for poultry inside the high-risk area .
poultry must be kept indoors and gatherings of birds are banned .
after the outbreak , veterinary experts at the european commission approved the german measures .
" the commission has examined those measures in collaboration with germany , and is satisfied that the borders of areas a and b ... are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak , " a notice published on tuesday in the latest edition of the eu 's official journal said .
" areas a and b in germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalization fixed , " it said .
eu vets representing the bloc 's 27 member states will now meet to assess developments in bavaria and reassess the poultry protection measures in place .
this is expected later in the week .
threat assessment expected in first week of september bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts will check the quarantine measures " there is one -lsb- meeting -rsb- foreseen in early september but the date has not yet been fixed , " a commission official said in an interview with reuters .
" it would be a question of revisiting the commission decision and if necessary adapting the zones ... or making any adaptations that may be necessary if the situation evolves . "
the death of more than 400 ducks from the 170,000-strong flock in a short period alerted the farm to the possibility of a bird flu outbreak .
the outbreak was probably more widespread and of longer duration than first thought , veterinary officials admitted after analyzing the data from the bavarian farm .
examination of birds destroyed to contain the outbreak revealed that ducks from two other enclosures other than the one where the outbreak was first found had been infected , ottmar fick , head of the local veterinary authority said .
fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .
not all waterfowl suffered acute symptoms from the virus , and the incubation period could drag on over weeks , fick said .
he added that it was not clear whether infected birds had been offered for sale commercially .
" we can not exclude delivery , " fick said .

gabriel had said the reactors ' permits to produce a certain amount of electricity could be transferred to newer plants .
" it 's not about old or new , but about safe or not , " pofalla said on zdf television .
he added that there was no reason to believe that the older plants did not meet the necessary safety standards .
gabriel had said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that shutting down the plants would " significantly lower the general nuclear risk . "
he pointed to recent incidents at the krümmel and brunsbüttel plants .
the plants had to be shut down in june after problems occurred outside of the reactors .
subsequently , the authorities discovered additional problems in both places .
gabriel said that although the incidents had n't posed an immediate danger to people 's safety , they showed the " vulnerability of complex nuclear technology . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has irritated nulcear power proponents his suggestions to transfer permits to newer reactors could result in only 10 of germany 's 17 reactors being in use by 2009 , with the last one out of commission in 2023 , the paper calculated .
the nuclear phase-out germany agreed upon under former chancellor gerhard schröder 's government of social democrats and greens would result in the last reactor being shut down in 2020 .
industry dismissive germany 's nuclear industry dismissed gabriel 's comments , the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote in its monday edition .

" if there was a genuine safety problem , mr. gabriel would have had to shut down the plants a long time ago , " the person said .

gabriel had said the reactors ' permits to produce a certain amount of electricity could be transferred to newer plants .
" it 's not about old or new , but about safe or not , " pofalla said on zdf television .
he added that there was no reason to believe that the older plants did not meet the necessary safety standards .
gabriel had said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that shutting down the plants would " significantly lower the general nuclear risk . "
he pointed to recent incidents at the krümmel and brunsbüttel plants .
the plants had to be shut down in june after problems occurred outside of the reactors .
subsequently , the authorities discovered additional problems in both places .
gabriel said that although the incidents had n't posed an immediate danger to people 's safety , they showed the " vulnerability of complex nuclear technology . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has irritated nulcear power proponents his suggestions to transfer permits to newer reactors could result in only 10 of germany 's 17 reactors being in use by 2009 , with the last one out of commission in 2023 , the paper calculated .
the nuclear phase-out germany agreed upon under former chancellor gerhard schröder 's government of social democrats and greens would result in the last reactor being shut down in 2020 .
industry dismissive germany 's nuclear industry dismissed gabriel 's comments , the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote in its monday edition .
what was necessary was to discuss finding the right mixture of energy and what power sources would be needed in the future , it quoted an unnamed industry insider as saying .
" if there was a genuine safety problem , mr. gabriel would have had to shut down the plants a long time ago , " the person said .
energy companies active in germany have applied to transfer permits for energy production from new to old plants , but none have been filed to shift the permits from old to new plants , according to the süddeutsche zeitung .
the nuclear industry continues to push for germany to reverse its decision to phase out nuclear power .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , too , would prefer for germany to stick with nuclear energy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if there was a genuine safety problem , mr. gabriel would have had to shut down the plants a long time ago , " the person said .
energy companies active in germany have applied to transfer permits for energy production from new to old plants , but none have been filed to shift the permits from old to new plants , according to the süddeutsche zeitung .

the protection and surveillance zone , set-up as a standard short-term measure to prevent the spread of the disease , has two areas ; an initial three-kilometer -lrb- 1.9-mile -rrb- protection radius which is classified as a high-risk area -lrb- zone a -rrb- , and a 10-kilometer surveillance low-risk buffer zone -lrb- zone b -rrb- which separates the whole area from disease-free parts of germany .
at present , strict movement controls are in place for poultry inside the high-risk area .
poultry must be kept indoors and gatherings of birds are banned .
after the outbreak , veterinary experts at the european commission approved the german measures .
" the commission has examined those measures in collaboration with germany , and is satisfied that the borders of areas a and b ... are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak , " a notice published on tuesday in the latest edition of the eu 's official journal said .
" areas a and b in germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalization fixed , " it said .
eu vets representing the bloc 's 27 member states will now meet to assess developments in bavaria and reassess the poultry protection measures in place .
this is expected later in the week .
threat assessment expected in first week of september bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts will check the quarantine measures " there is one -lsb- meeting -rsb- foreseen in early september but the date has not yet been fixed , " a commission official said in an interview with reuters .
" it would be a question of revisiting the commission decision and if necessary adapting the zones ... or making any adaptations that may be necessary if the situation evolves . "
the death of more than 400 ducks from the 170,000-strong flock in a short period alerted the farm to the possibility of a bird flu outbreak .
the outbreak was probably more widespread and of longer duration than first thought , veterinary officials admitted after analyzing the data from the bavarian farm .
examination of birds destroyed to contain the outbreak revealed that ducks from two other enclosures other than the one where the outbreak was first found had been infected , ottmar fick , head of the local veterinary authority said .
fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .
not all waterfowl suffered acute symptoms from the virus , and the incubation period could drag on over weeks , fick said .
he added that it was not clear whether infected birds had been offered for sale commercially .
" we can not exclude delivery , " fick said .
following the discovery , the remainder of the flock at the farm was destroyed .
the h5n1 strain of avian influenza is fatal to humans but can not be transferred between humans .
it has hit wild water-birds and some domestic poultry in other parts of germany this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this can have devastating effects on their lives . gerhard müllner is the head of " pänz im veedel " -lrb- cologne dialect for " children in the neighborhood " -rrb- , an association made up of social workers and teachers working with some of cologne 's most deprived children . müllner is also in charge of the escher street day-care center in cologne , where he comes face to face with children directly suffering the effects of poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müllner worries about many of the kids he works with " we 've found that many children do n't have lunch , " müllner said .
" instead , they are given about a euro and then they run to the nearest kiosk to buy sweets or chips .
it 's not such much that they are eating the wrong food , but rather that are n't getting enough to eat . " children under 15 years in a family living from social welfare payments receive only an estimated 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- per day for food . a recent study by the research institute for child nutrition in bonn concluded that " even those who buy only at discount stores need to spend 4.68 euros daily in order to satisfy the appetite of a teenager with reasonable food . " one of pänz im veedel 's many activities is to subsidize lunch fees for needy kids . the eight-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter of aische bastürk -lsb- name changed -rsb- , a kurd , are just two of those who benefit from the association 's lunch program . migrants hard hit by poverty it 's estimated that some 30 percent of germany 's immigrants fall under the poverty line .
bastürk has been unemployed since she lost her job as a cashier shortly before christmas .
her family receives 600 euros in welfare payments , while her husband brings in 500 euros working as a waiter in a turkish fast food restaurant . according to bastürk , it just is n't enough .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school brings extra costs " i ca n't do anything with my children ; i ca n't even take them to the movies , " she said .
" my son would love to go to the cinema , but we just ca n't afford it .
i ca n't even afford a mcdonald 's meal for my children .
we have a lot of debt , and all of that has to be paid off . " schooling expensive , too it 's not just food that 's a problem though - finding the money for school materials is also a burden . " my daughter 's book fees were 40 euros , and then she needed things like exercise books , drawing equipment , art lessons and so on , " bastürk said .
" eighty euros disappeared just like that .
then there were also my son 's book fees - they were 100 euros . " child poverty rates in germany have drifted upwards since the beginning of 1990s .
christian butterwegge , a political science professor at cologne university , has conducted several studies into the effects of child poverty .
he says that 17 percent of germany 's 11.4 million children in germany live in households dependent on social welfare . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 1.9 million children in germany live in poverty in some regions of the country , this statistic is even higher ; in görlitz , a town near germany 's border with poland , 44 percent of children fall into this category . the benefits are n't high by anyone 's standards .
families receive monthly payments of 347 euros per adult and 208 euros per child under 16 . no birthday present this year , aische bastürk did n't even have enough money for a birthday party for her daughter . " i asked myself , ' how can you explain your actions to your daughter , " ' bastürk said .
" in the end , i took her aside , and talked to her like she was a grown woman .
she reacted so well .
i said , ' darling , i can make you a cake , but i ca n't do more . '
she hugged me and said , ' mom , i 'm just happy to have you , so that can be the celebration . " ' daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the protection and surveillance zone , set-up as a standard short-term measure to prevent the spread of the disease , has two areas ; an initial three-kilometer -lrb- 1.9-mile -rrb- protection radius which is classified as a high-risk area -lrb- zone a -rrb- , and a 10-kilometer surveillance low-risk buffer zone -lrb- zone b -rrb- which separates the whole area from disease-free parts of germany .
at present , strict movement controls are in place for poultry inside the high-risk area .
poultry must be kept indoors and gatherings of birds are banned .
after the outbreak , veterinary experts at the european commission approved the german measures .
" the commission has examined those measures in collaboration with germany , and is satisfied that the borders of areas a and b ... are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak , " a notice published on tuesday in the latest edition of the eu 's official journal said .
" areas a and b in germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalization fixed , " it said .
eu vets representing the bloc 's 27 member states will now meet to assess developments in bavaria and reassess the poultry protection measures in place .
this is expected later in the week .
threat assessment expected in first week of september bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts will check the quarantine measures " there is one -lsb- meeting -rsb- foreseen in early september but the date has not yet been fixed , " a commission official said in an interview with reuters .
" it would be a question of revisiting the commission decision and if necessary adapting the zones ... or making any adaptations that may be necessary if the situation evolves . "
the death of more than 400 ducks from the 170,000-strong flock in a short period alerted the farm to the possibility of a bird flu outbreak .
the outbreak was probably more widespread and of longer duration than first thought , veterinary officials admitted after analyzing the data from the bavarian farm .
examination of birds destroyed to contain the outbreak revealed that ducks from two other enclosures other than the one where the outbreak was first found had been infected , ottmar fick , head of the local veterinary authority said .
fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .
not all waterfowl suffered acute symptoms from the virus , and the incubation period could drag on over weeks , fick said .
he added that it was not clear whether infected birds had been offered for sale commercially .
" we can not exclude delivery , " fick said .
following the discovery , the remainder of the flock at the farm was destroyed .

fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .
not all waterfowl suffered acute symptoms from the virus , and the incubation period could drag on over weeks , fick said .
he added that it was not clear whether infected birds had been offered for sale commercially .
" we can not exclude delivery , " fick said .
following the discovery , the remainder of the flock at the farm was destroyed .
the h5n1 strain of avian influenza is fatal to humans but can not be transferred between humans .

gabriel had said the reactors ' permits to produce a certain amount of electricity could be transferred to newer plants .
" it 's not about old or new , but about safe or not , " pofalla said on zdf television .
he added that there was no reason to believe that the older plants did not meet the necessary safety standards .
gabriel had said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that shutting down the plants would " significantly lower the general nuclear risk . "
he pointed to recent incidents at the krümmel and brunsbüttel plants .
the plants had to be shut down in june after problems occurred outside of the reactors .
subsequently , the authorities discovered additional problems in both places .
gabriel said that although the incidents had n't posed an immediate danger to people 's safety , they showed the " vulnerability of complex nuclear technology . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has irritated nulcear power proponents his suggestions to transfer permits to newer reactors could result in only 10 of germany 's 17 reactors being in use by 2009 , with the last one out of commission in 2023 , the paper calculated .
the nuclear phase-out germany agreed upon under former chancellor gerhard schröder 's government of social democrats and greens would result in the last reactor being shut down in 2020 .
industry dismissive germany 's nuclear industry dismissed gabriel 's comments , the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote in its monday edition .
what was necessary was to discuss finding the right mixture of energy and what power sources would be needed in the future , it quoted an unnamed industry insider as saying .
" if there was a genuine safety problem , mr. gabriel would have had to shut down the plants a long time ago , " the person said .
energy companies active in germany have applied to transfer permits for energy production from new to old plants , but none have been filed to shift the permits from old to new plants , according to the süddeutsche zeitung .
the nuclear industry continues to push for germany to reverse its decision to phase out nuclear power .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , too , would prefer for germany to stick with nuclear energy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the protection and surveillance zone , set-up as a standard short-term measure to prevent the spread of the disease , has two areas ; an initial three-kilometer -lrb- 1.9-mile -rrb- protection radius which is classified as a high-risk area -lrb- zone a -rrb- , and a 10-kilometer surveillance low-risk buffer zone -lrb- zone b -rrb- which separates the whole area from disease-free parts of germany .
at present , strict movement controls are in place for poultry inside the high-risk area .
poultry must be kept indoors and gatherings of birds are banned .
after the outbreak , veterinary experts at the european commission approved the german measures .
" the commission has examined those measures in collaboration with germany , and is satisfied that the borders of areas a and b ... are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak , " a notice published on tuesday in the latest edition of the eu 's official journal said .
" areas a and b in germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalization fixed , " it said .
eu vets representing the bloc 's 27 member states will now meet to assess developments in bavaria and reassess the poultry protection measures in place .
this is expected later in the week .
threat assessment expected in first week of september bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts will check the quarantine measures " there is one -lsb- meeting -rsb- foreseen in early september but the date has not yet been fixed , " a commission official said in an interview with reuters .
" it would be a question of revisiting the commission decision and if necessary adapting the zones ... or making any adaptations that may be necessary if the situation evolves . "
the death of more than 400 ducks from the 170,000-strong flock in a short period alerted the farm to the possibility of a bird flu outbreak .
the outbreak was probably more widespread and of longer duration than first thought , veterinary officials admitted after analyzing the data from the bavarian farm .
examination of birds destroyed to contain the outbreak revealed that ducks from two other enclosures other than the one where the outbreak was first found had been infected , ottmar fick , head of the local veterinary authority said .
fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .

gabriel had said the reactors ' permits to produce a certain amount of electricity could be transferred to newer plants .
" it 's not about old or new , but about safe or not , " pofalla said on zdf television .
he added that there was no reason to believe that the older plants did not meet the necessary safety standards .
gabriel had said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that shutting down the plants would " significantly lower the general nuclear risk . "
he pointed to recent incidents at the krümmel and brunsbüttel plants .
the plants had to be shut down in june after problems occurred outside of the reactors .
subsequently , the authorities discovered additional problems in both places .
gabriel said that although the incidents had n't posed an immediate danger to people 's safety , they showed the " vulnerability of complex nuclear technology . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has irritated nulcear power proponents his suggestions to transfer permits to newer reactors could result in only 10 of germany 's 17 reactors being in use by 2009 , with the last one out of commission in 2023 , the paper calculated .
the nuclear phase-out germany agreed upon under former chancellor gerhard schröder 's government of social democrats and greens would result in the last reactor being shut down in 2020 .
industry dismissive germany 's nuclear industry dismissed gabriel 's comments , the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote in its monday edition .
what was necessary was to discuss finding the right mixture of energy and what power sources would be needed in the future , it quoted an unnamed industry insider as saying .
" if there was a genuine safety problem , mr. gabriel would have had to shut down the plants a long time ago , " the person said .
energy companies active in germany have applied to transfer permits for energy production from new to old plants , but none have been filed to shift the permits from old to new plants , according to the süddeutsche zeitung .
the nuclear industry continues to push for germany to reverse its decision to phase out nuclear power .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , too , would prefer for germany to stick with nuclear energy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gabriel had said the reactors ' permits to produce a certain amount of electricity could be transferred to newer plants .
" it 's not about old or new , but about safe or not , " pofalla said on zdf television .
he added that there was no reason to believe that the older plants did not meet the necessary safety standards .
gabriel had said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that shutting down the plants would " significantly lower the general nuclear risk . "
he pointed to recent incidents at the krümmel and brunsbüttel plants .
the plants had to be shut down in june after problems occurred outside of the reactors .
subsequently , the authorities discovered additional problems in both places .
gabriel said that although the incidents had n't posed an immediate danger to people 's safety , they showed the " vulnerability of complex nuclear technology . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has irritated nulcear power proponents his suggestions to transfer permits to newer reactors could result in only 10 of germany 's 17 reactors being in use by 2009 , with the last one out of commission in 2023 , the paper calculated .
the nuclear phase-out germany agreed upon under former chancellor gerhard schröder 's government of social democrats and greens would result in the last reactor being shut down in 2020 .
industry dismissive germany 's nuclear industry dismissed gabriel 's comments , the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote in its monday edition .
what was necessary was to discuss finding the right mixture of energy and what power sources would be needed in the future , it quoted an unnamed industry insider as saying .
" if there was a genuine safety problem , mr. gabriel would have had to shut down the plants a long time ago , " the person said .
energy companies active in germany have applied to transfer permits for energy production from new to old plants , but none have been filed to shift the permits from old to new plants , according to the süddeutsche zeitung .
the nuclear industry continues to push for germany to reverse its decision to phase out nuclear power .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , too , would prefer for germany to stick with nuclear energy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a one-crust pie , eaten in most german wine regions during the fall wine season . zwiebelkuchen is traditionally eaten with federweisser , a young wine available in germany in the fall .

the protection and surveillance zone , set-up as a standard short-term measure to prevent the spread of the disease , has two areas ; an initial three-kilometer -lrb- 1.9-mile -rrb- protection radius which is classified as a high-risk area -lrb- zone a -rrb- , and a 10-kilometer surveillance low-risk buffer zone -lrb- zone b -rrb- which separates the whole area from disease-free parts of germany .
at present , strict movement controls are in place for poultry inside the high-risk area .
poultry must be kept indoors and gatherings of birds are banned .
after the outbreak , veterinary experts at the european commission approved the german measures .
" the commission has examined those measures in collaboration with germany , and is satisfied that the borders of areas a and b ... are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak , " a notice published on tuesday in the latest edition of the eu 's official journal said .
" areas a and b in germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalization fixed , " it said .
eu vets representing the bloc 's 27 member states will now meet to assess developments in bavaria and reassess the poultry protection measures in place .

" it would be a question of revisiting the commission decision and if necessary adapting the zones ... or making any adaptations that may be necessary if the situation evolves . "
the death of more than 400 ducks from the 170,000-strong flock in a short period alerted the farm to the possibility of a bird flu outbreak .
the outbreak was probably more widespread and of longer duration than first thought , veterinary officials admitted after analyzing the data from the bavarian farm .
examination of birds destroyed to contain the outbreak revealed that ducks from two other enclosures other than the one where the outbreak was first found had been infected , ottmar fick , head of the local veterinary authority said .
fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .
not all waterfowl suffered acute symptoms from the virus , and the incubation period could drag on over weeks , fick said .
he added that it was not clear whether infected birds had been offered for sale commercially .
" we can not exclude delivery , " fick said .
following the discovery , the remainder of the flock at the farm was destroyed .

the protection and surveillance zone , set-up as a standard short-term measure to prevent the spread of the disease , has two areas ; an initial three-kilometer -lrb- 1.9-mile -rrb- protection radius which is classified as a high-risk area -lrb- zone a -rrb- , and a 10-kilometer surveillance low-risk buffer zone -lrb- zone b -rrb- which separates the whole area from disease-free parts of germany .
at present , strict movement controls are in place for poultry inside the high-risk area .
poultry must be kept indoors and gatherings of birds are banned .
after the outbreak , veterinary experts at the european commission approved the german measures .
" the commission has examined those measures in collaboration with germany , and is satisfied that the borders of areas a and b ... are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak , " a notice published on tuesday in the latest edition of the eu 's official journal said .
" areas a and b in germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalization fixed , " it said .
eu vets representing the bloc 's 27 member states will now meet to assess developments in bavaria and reassess the poultry protection measures in place .

" it would be a question of revisiting the commission decision and if necessary adapting the zones ... or making any adaptations that may be necessary if the situation evolves . "
the death of more than 400 ducks from the 170,000-strong flock in a short period alerted the farm to the possibility of a bird flu outbreak .
the outbreak was probably more widespread and of longer duration than first thought , veterinary officials admitted after analyzing the data from the bavarian farm .
examination of birds destroyed to contain the outbreak revealed that ducks from two other enclosures other than the one where the outbreak was first found had been infected , ottmar fick , head of the local veterinary authority said .
fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .

he added that it was not clear whether infected birds had been offered for sale commercially .
" we can not exclude delivery , " fick said .

the protection and surveillance zone , set-up as a standard short-term measure to prevent the spread of the disease , has two areas ; an initial three-kilometer -lrb- 1.9-mile -rrb- protection radius which is classified as a high-risk area -lrb- zone a -rrb- , and a 10-kilometer surveillance low-risk buffer zone -lrb- zone b -rrb- which separates the whole area from disease-free parts of germany .
at present , strict movement controls are in place for poultry inside the high-risk area .
poultry must be kept indoors and gatherings of birds are banned .
after the outbreak , veterinary experts at the european commission approved the german measures .
" the commission has examined those measures in collaboration with germany , and is satisfied that the borders of areas a and b ... are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak , " a notice published on tuesday in the latest edition of the eu 's official journal said .
" areas a and b in germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalization fixed , " it said .
eu vets representing the bloc 's 27 member states will now meet to assess developments in bavaria and reassess the poultry protection measures in place .
this is expected later in the week .
threat assessment expected in first week of september bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts will check the quarantine measures " there is one -lsb- meeting -rsb- foreseen in early september but the date has not yet been fixed , " a commission official said in an interview with reuters .
" it would be a question of revisiting the commission decision and if necessary adapting the zones ... or making any adaptations that may be necessary if the situation evolves . "
the death of more than 400 ducks from the 170,000-strong flock in a short period alerted the farm to the possibility of a bird flu outbreak .
the outbreak was probably more widespread and of longer duration than first thought , veterinary officials admitted after analyzing the data from the bavarian farm .
examination of birds destroyed to contain the outbreak revealed that ducks from two other enclosures other than the one where the outbreak was first found had been infected , ottmar fick , head of the local veterinary authority said .
fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .
not all waterfowl suffered acute symptoms from the virus , and the incubation period could drag on over weeks , fick said .
he added that it was not clear whether infected birds had been offered for sale commercially .
" we can not exclude delivery , " fick said .
following the discovery , the remainder of the flock at the farm was destroyed .
the h5n1 strain of avian influenza is fatal to humans but can not be transferred between humans .
it has hit wild water-birds and some domestic poultry in other parts of germany this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the protection and surveillance zone , set-up as a standard short-term measure to prevent the spread of the disease , has two areas ; an initial three-kilometer -lrb- 1.9-mile -rrb- protection radius which is classified as a high-risk area -lrb- zone a -rrb- , and a 10-kilometer surveillance low-risk buffer zone -lrb- zone b -rrb- which separates the whole area from disease-free parts of germany .
at present , strict movement controls are in place for poultry inside the high-risk area .
poultry must be kept indoors and gatherings of birds are banned .
after the outbreak , veterinary experts at the european commission approved the german measures .
" the commission has examined those measures in collaboration with germany , and is satisfied that the borders of areas a and b ... are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak , " a notice published on tuesday in the latest edition of the eu 's official journal said .
" areas a and b in germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalization fixed , " it said .

the death of more than 400 ducks from the 170,000-strong flock in a short period alerted the farm to the possibility of a bird flu outbreak .
the outbreak was probably more widespread and of longer duration than first thought , veterinary officials admitted after analyzing the data from the bavarian farm .
examination of birds destroyed to contain the outbreak revealed that ducks from two other enclosures other than the one where the outbreak was first found had been infected , ottmar fick , head of the local veterinary authority said .
fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .

he added that it was not clear whether infected birds had been offered for sale commercially .
" we can not exclude delivery , " fick said .

this can have devastating effects on their lives . gerhard müllner is the head of " pänz im veedel " -lrb- cologne dialect for " children in the neighborhood " -rrb- , an association made up of social workers and teachers working with some of cologne 's most deprived children . müllner is also in charge of the escher street day-care center in cologne , where he comes face to face with children directly suffering the effects of poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müllner worries about many of the kids he works with " we 've found that many children do n't have lunch , " müllner said .
" instead , they are given about a euro and then they run to the nearest kiosk to buy sweets or chips .
it 's not such much that they are eating the wrong food , but rather that are n't getting enough to eat . " children under 15 years in a family living from social welfare payments receive only an estimated 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- per day for food . a recent study by the research institute for child nutrition in bonn concluded that " even those who buy only at discount stores need to spend 4.68 euros daily in order to satisfy the appetite of a teenager with reasonable food . " one of pänz im veedel 's many activities is to subsidize lunch fees for needy kids . the eight-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter of aische bastürk -lsb- name changed -rsb- , a kurd , are just two of those who benefit from the association 's lunch program . migrants hard hit by poverty it 's estimated that some 30 percent of germany 's immigrants fall under the poverty line .
bastürk has been unemployed since she lost her job as a cashier shortly before christmas .
her family receives 600 euros in welfare payments , while her husband brings in 500 euros working as a waiter in a turkish fast food restaurant . according to bastürk , it just is n't enough .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school brings extra costs " i ca n't do anything with my children ; i ca n't even take them to the movies , " she said .
" my son would love to go to the cinema , but we just ca n't afford it .
i ca n't even afford a mcdonald 's meal for my children .
we have a lot of debt , and all of that has to be paid off . " schooling expensive , too it 's not just food that 's a problem though - finding the money for school materials is also a burden . " my daughter 's book fees were 40 euros , and then she needed things like exercise books , drawing equipment , art lessons and so on , " bastürk said .
" eighty euros disappeared just like that .
then there were also my son 's book fees - they were 100 euros . " child poverty rates in germany have drifted upwards since the beginning of 1990s .
christian butterwegge , a political science professor at cologne university , has conducted several studies into the effects of child poverty .
he says that 17 percent of germany 's 11.4 million children in germany live in households dependent on social welfare . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 1.9 million children in germany live in poverty in some regions of the country , this statistic is even higher ; in görlitz , a town near germany 's border with poland , 44 percent of children fall into this category . the benefits are n't high by anyone 's standards .
families receive monthly payments of 347 euros per adult and 208 euros per child under 16 . no birthday present this year , aische bastürk did n't even have enough money for a birthday party for her daughter . " i asked myself , ' how can you explain your actions to your daughter , " ' bastürk said .
" in the end , i took her aside , and talked to her like she was a grown woman .
she reacted so well .
i said , ' darling , i can make you a cake , but i ca n't do more . '
she hugged me and said , ' mom , i 'm just happy to have you , so that can be the celebration . " ' daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the protection and surveillance zone , set-up as a standard short-term measure to prevent the spread of the disease , has two areas ; an initial three-kilometer -lrb- 1.9-mile -rrb- protection radius which is classified as a high-risk area -lrb- zone a -rrb- , and a 10-kilometer surveillance low-risk buffer zone -lrb- zone b -rrb- which separates the whole area from disease-free parts of germany .
at present , strict movement controls are in place for poultry inside the high-risk area .
poultry must be kept indoors and gatherings of birds are banned .
after the outbreak , veterinary experts at the european commission approved the german measures .
" the commission has examined those measures in collaboration with germany , and is satisfied that the borders of areas a and b ... are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak , " a notice published on tuesday in the latest edition of the eu 's official journal said .
" areas a and b in germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalization fixed , " it said .
eu vets representing the bloc 's 27 member states will now meet to assess developments in bavaria and reassess the poultry protection measures in place .
this is expected later in the week .
threat assessment expected in first week of september bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts will check the quarantine measures " there is one -lsb- meeting -rsb- foreseen in early september but the date has not yet been fixed , " a commission official said in an interview with reuters .
" it would be a question of revisiting the commission decision and if necessary adapting the zones ... or making any adaptations that may be necessary if the situation evolves . "
the death of more than 400 ducks from the 170,000-strong flock in a short period alerted the farm to the possibility of a bird flu outbreak .
the outbreak was probably more widespread and of longer duration than first thought , veterinary officials admitted after analyzing the data from the bavarian farm .
examination of birds destroyed to contain the outbreak revealed that ducks from two other enclosures other than the one where the outbreak was first found had been infected , ottmar fick , head of the local veterinary authority said .
fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .
not all waterfowl suffered acute symptoms from the virus , and the incubation period could drag on over weeks , fick said .
he added that it was not clear whether infected birds had been offered for sale commercially .
" we can not exclude delivery , " fick said .
following the discovery , the remainder of the flock at the farm was destroyed .
the h5n1 strain of avian influenza is fatal to humans but can not be transferred between humans .

gabriel had said the reactors ' permits to produce a certain amount of electricity could be transferred to newer plants .
" it 's not about old or new , but about safe or not , " pofalla said on zdf television .
he added that there was no reason to believe that the older plants did not meet the necessary safety standards .
gabriel had said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that shutting down the plants would " significantly lower the general nuclear risk . "
he pointed to recent incidents at the krümmel and brunsbüttel plants .
the plants had to be shut down in june after problems occurred outside of the reactors .
subsequently , the authorities discovered additional problems in both places .
gabriel said that although the incidents had n't posed an immediate danger to people 's safety , they showed the " vulnerability of complex nuclear technology . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has irritated nulcear power proponents his suggestions to transfer permits to newer reactors could result in only 10 of germany 's 17 reactors being in use by 2009 , with the last one out of commission in 2023 , the paper calculated .
the nuclear phase-out germany agreed upon under former chancellor gerhard schröder 's government of social democrats and greens would result in the last reactor being shut down in 2020 .
industry dismissive germany 's nuclear industry dismissed gabriel 's comments , the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote in its monday edition .
what was necessary was to discuss finding the right mixture of energy and what power sources would be needed in the future , it quoted an unnamed industry insider as saying .
" if there was a genuine safety problem , mr. gabriel would have had to shut down the plants a long time ago , " the person said .
energy companies active in germany have applied to transfer permits for energy production from new to old plants , but none have been filed to shift the permits from old to new plants , according to the süddeutsche zeitung .
the nuclear industry continues to push for germany to reverse its decision to phase out nuclear power .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , too , would prefer for germany to stick with nuclear energy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the protection and surveillance zone , set-up as a standard short-term measure to prevent the spread of the disease , has two areas ; an initial three-kilometer -lrb- 1.9-mile -rrb- protection radius which is classified as a high-risk area -lrb- zone a -rrb- , and a 10-kilometer surveillance low-risk buffer zone -lrb- zone b -rrb- which separates the whole area from disease-free parts of germany .
at present , strict movement controls are in place for poultry inside the high-risk area .
poultry must be kept indoors and gatherings of birds are banned .
after the outbreak , veterinary experts at the european commission approved the german measures .
" the commission has examined those measures in collaboration with germany , and is satisfied that the borders of areas a and b ... are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak , " a notice published on tuesday in the latest edition of the eu 's official journal said .
" areas a and b in germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalization fixed , " it said .
eu vets representing the bloc 's 27 member states will now meet to assess developments in bavaria and reassess the poultry protection measures in place .
this is expected later in the week .
threat assessment expected in first week of september bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts will check the quarantine measures " there is one -lsb- meeting -rsb- foreseen in early september but the date has not yet been fixed , " a commission official said in an interview with reuters .
" it would be a question of revisiting the commission decision and if necessary adapting the zones ... or making any adaptations that may be necessary if the situation evolves . "
the death of more than 400 ducks from the 170,000-strong flock in a short period alerted the farm to the possibility of a bird flu outbreak .
the outbreak was probably more widespread and of longer duration than first thought , veterinary officials admitted after analyzing the data from the bavarian farm .
examination of birds destroyed to contain the outbreak revealed that ducks from two other enclosures other than the one where the outbreak was first found had been infected , ottmar fick , head of the local veterinary authority said .
fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .
not all waterfowl suffered acute symptoms from the virus , and the incubation period could drag on over weeks , fick said .
he added that it was not clear whether infected birds had been offered for sale commercially .
" we can not exclude delivery , " fick said .
following the discovery , the remainder of the flock at the farm was destroyed .
the h5n1 strain of avian influenza is fatal to humans but can not be transferred between humans .

the protection and surveillance zone , set-up as a standard short-term measure to prevent the spread of the disease , has two areas ; an initial three-kilometer -lrb- 1.9-mile -rrb- protection radius which is classified as a high-risk area -lrb- zone a -rrb- , and a 10-kilometer surveillance low-risk buffer zone -lrb- zone b -rrb- which separates the whole area from disease-free parts of germany .
at present , strict movement controls are in place for poultry inside the high-risk area .
poultry must be kept indoors and gatherings of birds are banned .
after the outbreak , veterinary experts at the european commission approved the german measures .
" the commission has examined those measures in collaboration with germany , and is satisfied that the borders of areas a and b ... are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak , " a notice published on tuesday in the latest edition of the eu 's official journal said .
" areas a and b in germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalization fixed , " it said .
eu vets representing the bloc 's 27 member states will now meet to assess developments in bavaria and reassess the poultry protection measures in place .
this is expected later in the week .
threat assessment expected in first week of september bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts will check the quarantine measures " there is one -lsb- meeting -rsb- foreseen in early september but the date has not yet been fixed , " a commission official said in an interview with reuters .
" it would be a question of revisiting the commission decision and if necessary adapting the zones ... or making any adaptations that may be necessary if the situation evolves . "
the death of more than 400 ducks from the 170,000-strong flock in a short period alerted the farm to the possibility of a bird flu outbreak .
the outbreak was probably more widespread and of longer duration than first thought , veterinary officials admitted after analyzing the data from the bavarian farm .
examination of birds destroyed to contain the outbreak revealed that ducks from two other enclosures other than the one where the outbreak was first found had been infected , ottmar fick , head of the local veterinary authority said .
fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .
not all waterfowl suffered acute symptoms from the virus , and the incubation period could drag on over weeks , fick said .
he added that it was not clear whether infected birds had been offered for sale commercially .
" we can not exclude delivery , " fick said .
following the discovery , the remainder of the flock at the farm was destroyed .
the h5n1 strain of avian influenza is fatal to humans but can not be transferred between humans .
it has hit wild water-birds and some domestic poultry in other parts of germany this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de bird-flu find results in germany 's biggest bird cull ever german health officials slaughtered 160,000 geese over the weekend after the deadly h5n1 bird-flu virus was found in a poultry farm near the city of erlangen .
the cull was ordered after 400 geese were found dead .

the protection and surveillance zone , set-up as a standard short-term measure to prevent the spread of the disease , has two areas ; an initial three-kilometer -lrb- 1.9-mile -rrb- protection radius which is classified as a high-risk area -lrb- zone a -rrb- , and a 10-kilometer surveillance low-risk buffer zone -lrb- zone b -rrb- which separates the whole area from disease-free parts of germany .
at present , strict movement controls are in place for poultry inside the high-risk area .
poultry must be kept indoors and gatherings of birds are banned .
after the outbreak , veterinary experts at the european commission approved the german measures .
" the commission has examined those measures in collaboration with germany , and is satisfied that the borders of areas a and b ... are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak , " a notice published on tuesday in the latest edition of the eu 's official journal said .
" areas a and b in germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalization fixed , " it said .
eu vets representing the bloc 's 27 member states will now meet to assess developments in bavaria and reassess the poultry protection measures in place .
this is expected later in the week .
threat assessment expected in first week of september bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu experts will check the quarantine measures " there is one -lsb- meeting -rsb- foreseen in early september but the date has not yet been fixed , " a commission official said in an interview with reuters .
" it would be a question of revisiting the commission decision and if necessary adapting the zones ... or making any adaptations that may be necessary if the situation evolves . "
the death of more than 400 ducks from the 170,000-strong flock in a short period alerted the farm to the possibility of a bird flu outbreak .
the outbreak was probably more widespread and of longer duration than first thought , veterinary officials admitted after analyzing the data from the bavarian farm .
examination of birds destroyed to contain the outbreak revealed that ducks from two other enclosures other than the one where the outbreak was first found had been infected , ottmar fick , head of the local veterinary authority said .
fick noted , however , that it was unclear whether these birds had also been infected with the h5n1 virus , which is potentially deadly to humans .
he added that it was possible that the h5n1 virus had been present for some time on the farm but that the symptoms had shown only in one of the 15 enclosures .
full scope of outbreak yet to be revealed , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test carried out at the farm leave some questions unanswered experts are still trying to find out where the virus originated .
earlier reports said it might have been transferred in straw .
not all waterfowl suffered acute symptoms from the virus , and the incubation period could drag on over weeks , fick said .
he added that it was not clear whether infected birds had been offered for sale commercially .
" we can not exclude delivery , " fick said .
following the discovery , the remainder of the flock at the farm was destroyed .

this can have devastating effects on their lives . gerhard müllner is the head of " pänz im veedel " -lrb- cologne dialect for " children in the neighborhood " -rrb- , an association made up of social workers and teachers working with some of cologne 's most deprived children . müllner is also in charge of the escher street day-care center in cologne , where he comes face to face with children directly suffering the effects of poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müllner worries about many of the kids he works with " we 've found that many children do n't have lunch , " müllner said .
" instead , they are given about a euro and then they run to the nearest kiosk to buy sweets or chips .
it 's not such much that they are eating the wrong food , but rather that are n't getting enough to eat . " children under 15 years in a family living from social welfare payments receive only an estimated 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- per day for food . a recent study by the research institute for child nutrition in bonn concluded that " even those who buy only at discount stores need to spend 4.68 euros daily in order to satisfy the appetite of a teenager with reasonable food . " one of pänz im veedel 's many activities is to subsidize lunch fees for needy kids . the eight-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter of aische bastürk -lsb- name changed -rsb- , a kurd , are just two of those who benefit from the association 's lunch program . migrants hard hit by poverty it 's estimated that some 30 percent of germany 's immigrants fall under the poverty line .
bastürk has been unemployed since she lost her job as a cashier shortly before christmas .
her family receives 600 euros in welfare payments , while her husband brings in 500 euros working as a waiter in a turkish fast food restaurant . according to bastürk , it just is n't enough .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school brings extra costs " i ca n't do anything with my children ; i ca n't even take them to the movies , " she said .
" my son would love to go to the cinema , but we just ca n't afford it .
i ca n't even afford a mcdonald 's meal for my children .
we have a lot of debt , and all of that has to be paid off . " schooling expensive , too it 's not just food that 's a problem though - finding the money for school materials is also a burden . " my daughter 's book fees were 40 euros , and then she needed things like exercise books , drawing equipment , art lessons and so on , " bastürk said .
" eighty euros disappeared just like that .
then there were also my son 's book fees - they were 100 euros . " child poverty rates in germany have drifted upwards since the beginning of 1990s .
christian butterwegge , a political science professor at cologne university , has conducted several studies into the effects of child poverty .
he says that 17 percent of germany 's 11.4 million children in germany live in households dependent on social welfare . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 1.9 million children in germany live in poverty in some regions of the country , this statistic is even higher ; in görlitz , a town near germany 's border with poland , 44 percent of children fall into this category . the benefits are n't high by anyone 's standards .
families receive monthly payments of 347 euros per adult and 208 euros per child under 16 . no birthday present this year , aische bastürk did n't even have enough money for a birthday party for her daughter . " i asked myself , ' how can you explain your actions to your daughter , " ' bastürk said .
" in the end , i took her aside , and talked to her like she was a grown woman .
she reacted so well .
i said , ' darling , i can make you a cake , but i ca n't do more . '
she hugged me and said , ' mom , i 'm just happy to have you , so that can be the celebration . " ' daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gabriel had said the reactors ' permits to produce a certain amount of electricity could be transferred to newer plants .
" it 's not about old or new , but about safe or not , " pofalla said on zdf television .
he added that there was no reason to believe that the older plants did not meet the necessary safety standards .
gabriel had said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that shutting down the plants would " significantly lower the general nuclear risk . "
he pointed to recent incidents at the krümmel and brunsbüttel plants .
the plants had to be shut down in june after problems occurred outside of the reactors .
subsequently , the authorities discovered additional problems in both places .
gabriel said that although the incidents had n't posed an immediate danger to people 's safety , they showed the " vulnerability of complex nuclear technology . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has irritated nulcear power proponents his suggestions to transfer permits to newer reactors could result in only 10 of germany 's 17 reactors being in use by 2009 , with the last one out of commission in 2023 , the paper calculated .
the nuclear phase-out germany agreed upon under former chancellor gerhard schröder 's government of social democrats and greens would result in the last reactor being shut down in 2020 .
industry dismissive germany 's nuclear industry dismissed gabriel 's comments , the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote in its monday edition .
what was necessary was to discuss finding the right mixture of energy and what power sources would be needed in the future , it quoted an unnamed industry insider as saying .
" if there was a genuine safety problem , mr. gabriel would have had to shut down the plants a long time ago , " the person said .
energy companies active in germany have applied to transfer permits for energy production from new to old plants , but none have been filed to shift the permits from old to new plants , according to the süddeutsche zeitung .
the nuclear industry continues to push for germany to reverse its decision to phase out nuclear power .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , too , would prefer for germany to stick with nuclear energy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by lissa cook bbc radio five live report repossessions are up by 30 % in the last year are increases in your mortgage repayments set to break the bank ?
are the credit card bills piling up on the doormat ?
if the bank of england pushes up interest rates for a sixth time on thursday it could be the final straw for the people clinging on to the bottom rung of the property ladder .
repossessions have risen by 30 % over the past year and are at their highest level for seven years .
and it 's not hard to see why .
we 've had five interest rate rises in the past year .
debt is at record levels and inflation is squeezing our disposable income .
but there are schemes which claim to offer a solution : one which allows you to pay off your debts - and stay in your own home .
had there been another way i out i would n't have done it , but there was just no other way out if i wanted to keep the house victoria taylor stretched homeowners eye rental option only instead of owning your house , you sell it - using the proceeds to clear your mortgage and other debts - and become a tenant , paying rent .
low offers it looks attractive .
but peter tutton , of citizens advice bureau , says it 's difficult to know if you 're getting a good deal - not least because of the inevitable emotional vulnerability of those faced with losing their home .
" the sale could be at a very , very large discount to its market value - in some cases 65 % of the price you would get on the open market , " he says .
insecurity his colleague hayley rowley , a cab specialist support officer in wolverhampton , is seeing some horrific cases .
" we saw an elderly gent living on his own whose home was valued at about £ 165,000 , " she recalls .
" he had no mortgage but had fallen behind on credit cards .
" he agreed to sell his house for £ 40,000 , so that 's £ 120,000 below market value , and remains there - at the mercy , really - of the new owner on a six-month assured short-term tenancy , that can be ended at any point with two months ' notice . "
