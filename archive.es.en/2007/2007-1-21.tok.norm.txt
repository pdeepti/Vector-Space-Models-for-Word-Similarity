" i would have liked to have seen a clearer declaration on the christian roots -lrb- of europe -rrb- , " she said . " no one doubts that they significantly shape our life , our society , " the chancellor said . " i wonder , can we maintain the formative aspects of christianity for day-to-day politics if the political sphere does not stand by them ? " merkel vows to revive eu charter the comments come days after merkel outlined her plans to jumpstart the stalled bid to establish a first-ever constitution for the eu , whose presidency germany holds through june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has welcomed merkel 's push to revive the embattled eu charter she has said she would like to maintain as much as possible of the current draft treaty , which has been in the deep freeze since voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in referendums in 2005 .
merkel wants the eu to approve a revised version of the constitution draft by early 2009 . separately , eu commission president jose manuel barroso said he hoped germany 's eu presidency would yield more than a calendar for reviving the constitution . " i hope that , in addition to the road map , a clearer delineation of what the goal is can be achieved .
that is , a clearer definition of what each member state must achieve , " barroso said in an interview with german television station n-tv . critics say christian reference would exclude many the vatican and other church organizations have expressed regret that the document does not include an explicit reference to europe 's judeo-christian origins . but critics warned that such a reference would exclude european muslims and potential member state turkey , which is predominantly muslim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reference to the eu 's christian roots would sit uneasily with largely muslim turkey , an eu aspirant merkel 's conservative christian union bloc favors a " privileged partnership " with turkey as opposed to full eu membership .
but it has agreed to support the eu 's ongoing accession negotiations with ankara as part of her government 's coalition agreement with the center-left social democrats . last year merkel was among the eu politicians campaigning for a more explicit reference to europe 's christian roots . plans to include such a reference were originally blocked by french president jacques chirac .
some german officials hope french conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy , who has criticized france 's official secularism as too rigid , may support their campaign . sarkozy has also argued against allowing turkey , a predominantly muslim country , to join the eu . merkel : eu not a " christian club " although merkel has said it is vital to acknowledge europe 's christian heritage , she stresses that europe is a diverse continent .
merkel said the eu was not a " christian club " but was a " club of values . " " we will never accept positions that say that the dignity of human beings can be violated or that men and women should have different opportunities to develop .
europe must be ready to stand by these values and fight for them .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism .

serbians vote sunday for a new government in polls pitting pro-western and ultra-nationalist forces against each other .
the west says serbia must now decide if it wants its future to be european . taking advantage of unseasonably warm winter weather , voters began trickling in to some of the more than 8,500 polling stations across the balkan nation , including serbs in ethnic-albanian dominated kosovo . serbia 's 6.6 million electorate , which excludes ethnic albanians in its disputed southern province , is voting for 250 parliamentary deputies from 20 political groups . serbia 's eu membership hopes at stake at stake is serbia 's hope of eventual european union membership , which hinges on belgrade 's war crimes cooperation , namely by capturing former bosnian serb general ratko mladic , who is wanted for genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratko mladic remains a sticking point between the west and serbia brussels froze talks on closer ties last year and said it would restart them only when mladic was on trial . some western officials accuse hardline nationalists in serbia 's military and police of helping mladic to hide and evade trial by the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague . " we sincerely hope the voters will turn out in large numbers and choose a european future for their country , " said british ambassador steven wordsworth . german ambassador andreas zobel said the elections " are of an extraordinary importance because they will determine the direction in which serbia wishes to develop .

" these elections are a turning point between the past , old-fashioned , traditional and incapable politics and a strategy which solves problems ... and leads serbia to the eu , " tadic said during campaigning . official poll monitors , the centre for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- , said they believed the outcome of the election was one of the most " uncertain " in the country 's history .

germany is one of europe 's most densely forested countries , and soaring oil and gas prices are leading more households to switch to modern wood-burning heating systems , germany 's forest owners ' association says . " wood grows through god 's hand and no further energy is needed to produce it , " said michael prince zu salm-salm , the association 's president . one-third of germany is covered with forests despite it being the european union 's most populous country with the biggest industrial economy . germany is europe 's leading timber producer , and salm-salm said standardized wood pellets can be produced from vast numbers of small or deformed trees which are thinned from forests to allow growth of better quality timber . until recently , such trees had no economic value and were left to rot in the woods .
but salm-salm underlined that rotting wood releases the same amount of co2 - which is stored while a tree grows - as does burning the wood to produce heat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wood pellets could be the heating source of the future " this means burning wood is co2 neutral , " said salm-salm .
carbon dioxide , or co2 , emissions are widely believed to be a cause of climate change .
a growing market heating systems fuelled by wood pellets have been installed in 70,000 german buildings in recent years .
the technology - which is more expensive than oil or gas burners - is subsidized by the german government . this is still a small number out of the roughly 38 million german households .
but the sector 's growth has been explosive , starting with just 800 units nationwide in 1999 and growing to 27,000 units in 2004 . numerous factories that produce wood pellets have opened in germany in recent years , including the market leader , german pellets , based in the eastern baltic sea city of wismar . set up in 2005 , german pellets now produces 400,000 tons of wood pellets per year and sells not only to german customers , but also to denmark and sweden , according to ceo peter h. leibold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german households are increasingly turning to wood for heating , forest owners say leibold said new technology for burning pellets produces minimal ash and is as easy to operate as a conventional oil or gas system .
he said enough pellets for an entire winter are blown into a basement container and then automatically transported to the burner . " if we had the political will , germany could provide 100 per cent of its winter heating from wood , " leibold said .
made at home trees were not the only source for making pellets , he said .
millions of acres of farmland can provide straw , which is routinely ploughed under , for pellets . noting recent russian cut-offs of oil and gas , leibold said not only was wood a cheaper way to heat , but it is also a safer source . " this is energy security ... because it 's domestically produced , " he said . salm-salm noted that with only about 70 percent of annual wood volume growth in german forests being harvested each year , there is great capacity to expand wood burning heating systems .
a forester 's dream despite growing interest in wood for heating and rising timber prices , there is little danger of depleting forestry resources , said salm-salm .
german sustainable forestry laws are among the strictest in the world , he stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has strict laws to protect its forests from too much logging " you can not cut down more than grow each year , " he said . sustainable forestry was established in germany almost 300 years ago by royal saxony state forester hans carl von carlowitz with his groundbreaking book " sylvicultura oeconomica .

serbians vote sunday for a new government in polls pitting pro-western and ultra-nationalist forces against each other .
the west says serbia must now decide if it wants its future to be european . taking advantage of unseasonably warm winter weather , voters began trickling in to some of the more than 8,500 polling stations across the balkan nation , including serbs in ethnic-albanian dominated kosovo . serbia 's 6.6 million electorate , which excludes ethnic albanians in its disputed southern province , is voting for 250 parliamentary deputies from 20 political groups . serbia 's eu membership hopes at stake at stake is serbia 's hope of eventual european union membership , which hinges on belgrade 's war crimes cooperation , namely by capturing former bosnian serb general ratko mladic , who is wanted for genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratko mladic remains a sticking point between the west and serbia brussels froze talks on closer ties last year and said it would restart them only when mladic was on trial . some western officials accuse hardline nationalists in serbia 's military and police of helping mladic to hide and evade trial by the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague . " we sincerely hope the voters will turn out in large numbers and choose a european future for their country , " said british ambassador steven wordsworth . german ambassador andreas zobel said the elections " are of an extraordinary importance because they will determine the direction in which serbia wishes to develop . " the parliamentary elections come the year after the death of former autocratic president slobodan milosevic and the independence of serbia 's traditional partner montenegro in a historic referendum . " uncertain " outcome the decisive race is expected to be between president boris tadic 's reformist democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- , and conservative prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- . " these elections are a turning point between the past , old-fashioned , traditional and incapable politics and a strategy which solves problems ... and leads serbia to the eu , " tadic said during campaigning . official poll monitors , the centre for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- , said they believed the outcome of the election was one of the most " uncertain " in the country 's history . " there are some 250,000 new voters -lrb- since 2003 elections -rrb- and their ballots can be decisive as they are expected to vote for reformist forces , " the head of cesid , zoran lucic , said ahead of voting . opinion polls have shown none of the three leading parties are likely to win enough votes to form a government alone , with tadic and kostunica widely expected to put old differences behind them and join ranks in a coalition . fate of kosovo the election is set to have a strong bearing on kosovo , the un-run province of serbia that remains the most sensitive issue left over from the bloody 1990s breakup of the former yugoslavia . it comes just five days ahead of the presentation of un envoy martti ahtisaari 's plans for the status of kosovo , the ethnic-albanian majority province of serbia that has been run by the united nations since 1999 . ahtisaari , who led nine months of mostly fruitless talks between belgrade and pristina last year , chose to present his plans after the poll for fear it could boost the ultra-nationalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with serbian president tadic in berlin in dec .
2006 german chancellor angela merkel , whose country heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , said in an interview with news agency reuters this week that any decision on kosovo must bring " maximum " satisfaction to the citizens of the province without stirring unrest in serbia . " we need maximum satisfaction in kosovo but also satisfaction , or at least no turbulence , in serbia , " merkel said ahead of sunday 's serbian elections .
" first we want to see the democratic powers in serbia strengthened after the election and then we will do everything we can to negotiate astutely while still moving ahead with political decisions . " ethnic albanians , who comprise about 90 percent of kosovo 's two million people , want nothing less than independence , a demand belgrade staunchly opposes , instead offering them wide autonomy . the major parties say they will not accept the loss of kosovo , but the democratic party of president boris tadic - the party favored by the west - has come closest to telling serbs that it might be inevitable . jaded voters despite the importance of the poll , a large number of voters are expected to abstain , fed up with politics and serbia 's protracted transition from communism , which has been delayed by the wars of the 1990s and their aftermath . more than six years since the ouster of former strongman milosevic , the impoverished country lags behind its neighbours with an average monthly salary of about 250 euros -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- and about one million unemployed . some 500 international and 5,000 local observers were monitoring the vote .
unofficial preliminary results were expected late sunday , while the final outcome is to be presented by january 25 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu may accept extra kosovo status talks after serbian elections wary of a un security council veto from russia , the eu appears ready to allow more time for talks on the future status of kosovo after serbia elects its new parliament on sunday .

" there are some 250,000 new voters -lrb- since 2003 elections -rrb- and their ballots can be decisive as they are expected to vote for reformist forces , " the head of cesid , zoran lucic , said ahead of voting . opinion polls have shown none of the three leading parties are likely to win enough votes to form a government alone , with tadic and kostunica widely expected to put old differences behind them and join ranks in a coalition . fate of kosovo the election is set to have a strong bearing on kosovo , the un-run province of serbia that remains the most sensitive issue left over from the bloody 1990s breakup of the former yugoslavia . it comes just five days ahead of the presentation of un envoy martti ahtisaari 's plans for the status of kosovo , the ethnic-albanian majority province of serbia that has been run by the united nations since 1999 . ahtisaari , who led nine months of mostly fruitless talks between belgrade and pristina last year , chose to present his plans after the poll for fear it could boost the ultra-nationalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with serbian president tadic in berlin in dec .
2006 german chancellor angela merkel , whose country heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , said in an interview with news agency reuters this week that any decision on kosovo must bring " maximum " satisfaction to the citizens of the province without stirring unrest in serbia . " we need maximum satisfaction in kosovo but also satisfaction , or at least no turbulence , in serbia , " merkel said ahead of sunday 's serbian elections .
" first we want to see the democratic powers in serbia strengthened after the election and then we will do everything we can to negotiate astutely while still moving ahead with political decisions . " ethnic albanians , who comprise about 90 percent of kosovo 's two million people , want nothing less than independence , a demand belgrade staunchly opposes , instead offering them wide autonomy . the major parties say they will not accept the loss of kosovo , but the democratic party of president boris tadic - the party favored by the west - has come closest to telling serbs that it might be inevitable . jaded voters despite the importance of the poll , a large number of voters are expected to abstain , fed up with politics and serbia 's protracted transition from communism , which has been delayed by the wars of the 1990s and their aftermath . more than six years since the ouster of former strongman milosevic , the impoverished country lags behind its neighbours with an average monthly salary of about 250 euros -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- and about one million unemployed . some 500 international and 5,000 local observers were monitoring the vote .

germany is one of europe 's most densely forested countries , and soaring oil and gas prices are leading more households to switch to modern wood-burning heating systems , germany 's forest owners ' association says . " wood grows through god 's hand and no further energy is needed to produce it , " said michael prince zu salm-salm , the association 's president . one-third of germany is covered with forests despite it being the european union 's most populous country with the biggest industrial economy . germany is europe 's leading timber producer , and salm-salm said standardized wood pellets can be produced from vast numbers of small or deformed trees which are thinned from forests to allow growth of better quality timber . until recently , such trees had no economic value and were left to rot in the woods .
but salm-salm underlined that rotting wood releases the same amount of co2 - which is stored while a tree grows - as does burning the wood to produce heat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wood pellets could be the heating source of the future " this means burning wood is co2 neutral , " said salm-salm .
carbon dioxide , or co2 , emissions are widely believed to be a cause of climate change .
a growing market heating systems fuelled by wood pellets have been installed in 70,000 german buildings in recent years .
the technology - which is more expensive than oil or gas burners - is subsidized by the german government . this is still a small number out of the roughly 38 million german households .
but the sector 's growth has been explosive , starting with just 800 units nationwide in 1999 and growing to 27,000 units in 2004 . numerous factories that produce wood pellets have opened in germany in recent years , including the market leader , german pellets , based in the eastern baltic sea city of wismar . set up in 2005 , german pellets now produces 400,000 tons of wood pellets per year and sells not only to german customers , but also to denmark and sweden , according to ceo peter h. leibold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german households are increasingly turning to wood for heating , forest owners say leibold said new technology for burning pellets produces minimal ash and is as easy to operate as a conventional oil or gas system .
he said enough pellets for an entire winter are blown into a basement container and then automatically transported to the burner . " if we had the political will , germany could provide 100 per cent of its winter heating from wood , " leibold said .
made at home trees were not the only source for making pellets , he said .
millions of acres of farmland can provide straw , which is routinely ploughed under , for pellets . noting recent russian cut-offs of oil and gas , leibold said not only was wood a cheaper way to heat , but it is also a safer source . " this is energy security ... because it 's domestically produced , " he said . salm-salm noted that with only about 70 percent of annual wood volume growth in german forests being harvested each year , there is great capacity to expand wood burning heating systems .
a forester 's dream despite growing interest in wood for heating and rising timber prices , there is little danger of depleting forestry resources , said salm-salm .
german sustainable forestry laws are among the strictest in the world , he stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has strict laws to protect its forests from too much logging " you can not cut down more than grow each year , " he said . sustainable forestry was established in germany almost 300 years ago by royal saxony state forester hans carl von carlowitz with his groundbreaking book " sylvicultura oeconomica .

" i would have liked to have seen a clearer declaration on the christian roots -lrb- of europe -rrb- , " she said . " no one doubts that they significantly shape our life , our society , " the chancellor said . " i wonder , can we maintain the formative aspects of christianity for day-to-day politics if the political sphere does not stand by them ? " merkel vows to revive eu charter the comments come days after merkel outlined her plans to jumpstart the stalled bid to establish a first-ever constitution for the eu , whose presidency germany holds through june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has welcomed merkel 's push to revive the embattled eu charter she has said she would like to maintain as much as possible of the current draft treaty , which has been in the deep freeze since voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in referendums in 2005 .
merkel wants the eu to approve a revised version of the constitution draft by early 2009 . separately , eu commission president jose manuel barroso said he hoped germany 's eu presidency would yield more than a calendar for reviving the constitution . " i hope that , in addition to the road map , a clearer delineation of what the goal is can be achieved .
that is , a clearer definition of what each member state must achieve , " barroso said in an interview with german television station n-tv . critics say christian reference would exclude many the vatican and other church organizations have expressed regret that the document does not include an explicit reference to europe 's judeo-christian origins . but critics warned that such a reference would exclude european muslims and potential member state turkey , which is predominantly muslim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reference to the eu 's christian roots would sit uneasily with largely muslim turkey , an eu aspirant merkel 's conservative christian union bloc favors a " privileged partnership " with turkey as opposed to full eu membership .
but it has agreed to support the eu 's ongoing accession negotiations with ankara as part of her government 's coalition agreement with the center-left social democrats . last year merkel was among the eu politicians campaigning for a more explicit reference to europe 's christian roots . plans to include such a reference were originally blocked by french president jacques chirac .
some german officials hope french conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy , who has criticized france 's official secularism as too rigid , may support their campaign . sarkozy has also argued against allowing turkey , a predominantly muslim country , to join the eu . merkel : eu not a " christian club " although merkel has said it is vital to acknowledge europe 's christian heritage , she stresses that europe is a diverse continent .
merkel said the eu was not a " christian club " but was a " club of values . " " we will never accept positions that say that the dignity of human beings can be violated or that men and women should have different opportunities to develop .
europe must be ready to stand by these values and fight for them .

" i 'm not sorry " his father tipped off the police about his son after police released pictures of the youth caught on the security camera of a bank near the scene of the murder . " he admitted he committed the murder " in his preliminary interrogation in samsun before he was flown to istanbul , samsun 's chief prosecutor ahmet gokcinar told anatolia news agency . " i shot him after saying the friday prayers .
i 'm not sorry , " the cnn turk news channel quoted the suspect as saying in his testimony . " i read news on the internet .
he said ' i 'm from turkey but turkish blood is dirty ' and that 's why i decided to kill him . " alleged murderer 's age cause for worry six other people suspected of being linked to the assassination were detained in trabzon , and four of them were also flown to istanbul sunday . pointing to samast 's young age , dink 's lawyer raised the possibility that he might be only a hitman manipulated by others behind the scene . " the boy might have pulled the trigger , but the authorities should find those who are behind him , " erdal dogan told the aksam newspaper .
" the state should not just say ' this boy did it ' and shut up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samast 's image was captured on a security camera this sentiment was echoed in a frontpage headline in liberal daily radikal : " they got a child to kill dink . " among the detainees flown from trabzon to istanbul was a friend of samast , named as yasin hayal , who spent 11 months in jail for a 2004 bomb blast outside a mcdonalds restaurant in trabzon , in which six people were injured , media reports said . samast said in his initial testimony that hayal encouraged him to kill dink and gave him the gun that he used in the shooting , mass-circulation milliyet newspaper reported . dink charged for insulting " turkishness " dink was one of the taboo-breaking critics of the official line on the massacre of armenians in 1915-18 under the ottoman empire , which he labeled as genocide .
last year , dink was given a suspended six-month jail sentence for insulting " turkishness . " nationalists had branded him a " traitor , " and dink wrote in his recent articles that he received threats and hate mail . the samsun police also detained two men who were travelling on the same bus as samast and sent them to istanbul , anatolia reported , without saying on what suspicion they were held . agos employees identified samast as the person who came to their office about three hours before the attack , presented himself as a university student and asked to see dink , istanbul governor muammer guler said . he was turned down , and when a secretary went out about two hours later she saw him still standing in the street outside . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan hailed samast 's detention " in the name of democracy and the struggle for freedom . "
the police will also look into any possible links between dink 's assassination and the murder of an italian catholic priest in trabzon in february , erdogan said . a 16-year-old youth was jailed in october for the murder of father andrea santoro , shot dead as he prayed at the santa maria catholic church in trabzon , a nationalist stronghold . eu " appalled " by killing the journalist 's murder sent shock waves through turkey , sparking nationwide demonstrations at which the most popular chant was " we are all armenians , we are all hrants . " despite the controversies , the soft-spoken and often emotional dink had won many hearts here as a sincere activist for turkish-armenian reconciliation , who also denounced armenian radicalism and most recently a french bill to jail those who deny that the massacres constituted genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrant dink broke taboos in turkey german presidency of the european union said saturday it was shocked and appalled by the murder of dink .
referring to the 53-year-old as a " respected " journalist , the eu presidency statement said dink was a " courageous man whose journalism was marked by his strong commitment to democracy and freedom of expression . "
it also said dink was prepared to take great personal risks for his work .
" he always strove to present a balanced picture and avoided provoking confrontations .
he staunchly supported the democratic reforms in turkey , " the eu presidency statement said .
" as a result , hrant dink was held in high esteem in various sections of turkish society , as well as in europe . "

" i 'm not sorry " his father tipped off the police about his son after police released pictures of the youth caught on the security camera of a bank near the scene of the murder . " he admitted he committed the murder " in his preliminary interrogation in samsun before he was flown to istanbul , samsun 's chief prosecutor ahmet gokcinar told anatolia news agency . " i shot him after saying the friday prayers .
i 'm not sorry , " the cnn turk news channel quoted the suspect as saying in his testimony . " i read news on the internet .
he said ' i 'm from turkey but turkish blood is dirty ' and that 's why i decided to kill him . " alleged murderer 's age cause for worry six other people suspected of being linked to the assassination were detained in trabzon , and four of them were also flown to istanbul sunday . pointing to samast 's young age , dink 's lawyer raised the possibility that he might be only a hitman manipulated by others behind the scene . " the boy might have pulled the trigger , but the authorities should find those who are behind him , " erdal dogan told the aksam newspaper .
" the state should not just say ' this boy did it ' and shut up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samast 's image was captured on a security camera this sentiment was echoed in a frontpage headline in liberal daily radikal : " they got a child to kill dink . " among the detainees flown from trabzon to istanbul was a friend of samast , named as yasin hayal , who spent 11 months in jail for a 2004 bomb blast outside a mcdonalds restaurant in trabzon , in which six people were injured , media reports said . samast said in his initial testimony that hayal encouraged him to kill dink and gave him the gun that he used in the shooting , mass-circulation milliyet newspaper reported . dink charged for insulting " turkishness " dink was one of the taboo-breaking critics of the official line on the massacre of armenians in 1915-18 under the ottoman empire , which he labeled as genocide .
last year , dink was given a suspended six-month jail sentence for insulting " turkishness . " nationalists had branded him a " traitor , " and dink wrote in his recent articles that he received threats and hate mail . the samsun police also detained two men who were travelling on the same bus as samast and sent them to istanbul , anatolia reported , without saying on what suspicion they were held . agos employees identified samast as the person who came to their office about three hours before the attack , presented himself as a university student and asked to see dink , istanbul governor muammer guler said . he was turned down , and when a secretary went out about two hours later she saw him still standing in the street outside . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan hailed samast 's detention " in the name of democracy and the struggle for freedom . "
the police will also look into any possible links between dink 's assassination and the murder of an italian catholic priest in trabzon in february , erdogan said . a 16-year-old youth was jailed in october for the murder of father andrea santoro , shot dead as he prayed at the santa maria catholic church in trabzon , a nationalist stronghold . eu " appalled " by killing the journalist 's murder sent shock waves through turkey , sparking nationwide demonstrations at which the most popular chant was " we are all armenians , we are all hrants . " despite the controversies , the soft-spoken and often emotional dink had won many hearts here as a sincere activist for turkish-armenian reconciliation , who also denounced armenian radicalism and most recently a french bill to jail those who deny that the massacres constituted genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrant dink broke taboos in turkey german presidency of the european union said saturday it was shocked and appalled by the murder of dink .
referring to the 53-year-old as a " respected " journalist , the eu presidency statement said dink was a " courageous man whose journalism was marked by his strong commitment to democracy and freedom of expression . "
it also said dink was prepared to take great personal risks for his work .
" he always strove to present a balanced picture and avoided provoking confrontations .
he staunchly supported the democratic reforms in turkey , " the eu presidency statement said .

germany is one of europe 's most densely forested countries , and soaring oil and gas prices are leading more households to switch to modern wood-burning heating systems , germany 's forest owners ' association says . " wood grows through god 's hand and no further energy is needed to produce it , " said michael prince zu salm-salm , the association 's president . one-third of germany is covered with forests despite it being the european union 's most populous country with the biggest industrial economy . germany is europe 's leading timber producer , and salm-salm said standardized wood pellets can be produced from vast numbers of small or deformed trees which are thinned from forests to allow growth of better quality timber . until recently , such trees had no economic value and were left to rot in the woods .
but salm-salm underlined that rotting wood releases the same amount of co2 - which is stored while a tree grows - as does burning the wood to produce heat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wood pellets could be the heating source of the future " this means burning wood is co2 neutral , " said salm-salm .
carbon dioxide , or co2 , emissions are widely believed to be a cause of climate change .
a growing market heating systems fuelled by wood pellets have been installed in 70,000 german buildings in recent years .
the technology - which is more expensive than oil or gas burners - is subsidized by the german government . this is still a small number out of the roughly 38 million german households .
but the sector 's growth has been explosive , starting with just 800 units nationwide in 1999 and growing to 27,000 units in 2004 . numerous factories that produce wood pellets have opened in germany in recent years , including the market leader , german pellets , based in the eastern baltic sea city of wismar . set up in 2005 , german pellets now produces 400,000 tons of wood pellets per year and sells not only to german customers , but also to denmark and sweden , according to ceo peter h. leibold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german households are increasingly turning to wood for heating , forest owners say leibold said new technology for burning pellets produces minimal ash and is as easy to operate as a conventional oil or gas system .
he said enough pellets for an entire winter are blown into a basement container and then automatically transported to the burner . " if we had the political will , germany could provide 100 per cent of its winter heating from wood , " leibold said .
made at home trees were not the only source for making pellets , he said .
millions of acres of farmland can provide straw , which is routinely ploughed under , for pellets . noting recent russian cut-offs of oil and gas , leibold said not only was wood a cheaper way to heat , but it is also a safer source . " this is energy security ... because it 's domestically produced , " he said . salm-salm noted that with only about 70 percent of annual wood volume growth in german forests being harvested each year , there is great capacity to expand wood burning heating systems .
a forester 's dream despite growing interest in wood for heating and rising timber prices , there is little danger of depleting forestry resources , said salm-salm .
german sustainable forestry laws are among the strictest in the world , he stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has strict laws to protect its forests from too much logging " you can not cut down more than grow each year , " he said . sustainable forestry was established in germany almost 300 years ago by royal saxony state forester hans carl von carlowitz with his groundbreaking book " sylvicultura oeconomica .

but ever more lawmakers are complaining about heavy pressure to quickly pass into law bills drafted sloppily by the federal government . when the light burns at the german chancellery late into the night , angela merkel is likely meeting with decision-makers in the governing coalition of her conservatives and the social democrats to wheel and deal . that 's often when new legislation is drafted , such as increasing the retirement age to 67 , introducing subsidies for new parents or drafting healthcare system reform .
when merkel and her partners announce the compromises they 've made the following morning , it usually sounds as if the decisions were final and any more discussion was moot . but the fact is those decisions must still be approved by germany 's parliament or bundestag . some parliamentarians , including sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free democrats , find the government 's behavior unacceptable . " it happens according to the principle : so much has been discussed outside parliament … and now the bundestag should n't dare to hold up such an important reform project , too - it must now be quickly waved through , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .

" and if you then want to make changes , then you always end up in the predicament that you have to damage your own people .

but ever more lawmakers are complaining about heavy pressure to quickly pass into law bills drafted sloppily by the federal government . when the light burns at the german chancellery late into the night , angela merkel is likely meeting with decision-makers in the governing coalition of her conservatives and the social democrats to wheel and deal . that 's often when new legislation is drafted , such as increasing the retirement age to 67 , introducing subsidies for new parents or drafting healthcare system reform .
when merkel and her partners announce the compromises they 've made the following morning , it usually sounds as if the decisions were final and any more discussion was moot . but the fact is those decisions must still be approved by germany 's parliament or bundestag . some parliamentarians , including sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free democrats , find the government 's behavior unacceptable . " it happens according to the principle : so much has been discussed outside parliament … and now the bundestag should n't dare to hold up such an important reform project , too - it must now be quickly waved through , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .

" i 'm not sorry " his father tipped off the police about his son after police released pictures of the youth caught on the security camera of a bank near the scene of the murder . " he admitted he committed the murder " in his preliminary interrogation in samsun before he was flown to istanbul , samsun 's chief prosecutor ahmet gokcinar told anatolia news agency . " i shot him after saying the friday prayers .
i 'm not sorry , " the cnn turk news channel quoted the suspect as saying in his testimony . " i read news on the internet .
he said ' i 'm from turkey but turkish blood is dirty ' and that 's why i decided to kill him . " alleged murderer 's age cause for worry six other people suspected of being linked to the assassination were detained in trabzon , and four of them were also flown to istanbul sunday . pointing to samast 's young age , dink 's lawyer raised the possibility that he might be only a hitman manipulated by others behind the scene . " the boy might have pulled the trigger , but the authorities should find those who are behind him , " erdal dogan told the aksam newspaper .
" the state should not just say ' this boy did it ' and shut up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samast 's image was captured on a security camera this sentiment was echoed in a frontpage headline in liberal daily radikal : " they got a child to kill dink . " among the detainees flown from trabzon to istanbul was a friend of samast , named as yasin hayal , who spent 11 months in jail for a 2004 bomb blast outside a mcdonalds restaurant in trabzon , in which six people were injured , media reports said . samast said in his initial testimony that hayal encouraged him to kill dink and gave him the gun that he used in the shooting , mass-circulation milliyet newspaper reported . dink charged for insulting " turkishness " dink was one of the taboo-breaking critics of the official line on the massacre of armenians in 1915-18 under the ottoman empire , which he labeled as genocide .
last year , dink was given a suspended six-month jail sentence for insulting " turkishness .

germany is one of europe 's most densely forested countries , and soaring oil and gas prices are leading more households to switch to modern wood-burning heating systems , germany 's forest owners ' association says . " wood grows through god 's hand and no further energy is needed to produce it , " said michael prince zu salm-salm , the association 's president . one-third of germany is covered with forests despite it being the european union 's most populous country with the biggest industrial economy . germany is europe 's leading timber producer , and salm-salm said standardized wood pellets can be produced from vast numbers of small or deformed trees which are thinned from forests to allow growth of better quality timber . until recently , such trees had no economic value and were left to rot in the woods .
but salm-salm underlined that rotting wood releases the same amount of co2 - which is stored while a tree grows - as does burning the wood to produce heat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wood pellets could be the heating source of the future " this means burning wood is co2 neutral , " said salm-salm .
carbon dioxide , or co2 , emissions are widely believed to be a cause of climate change .
a growing market heating systems fuelled by wood pellets have been installed in 70,000 german buildings in recent years .
the technology - which is more expensive than oil or gas burners - is subsidized by the german government . this is still a small number out of the roughly 38 million german households .
but the sector 's growth has been explosive , starting with just 800 units nationwide in 1999 and growing to 27,000 units in 2004 . numerous factories that produce wood pellets have opened in germany in recent years , including the market leader , german pellets , based in the eastern baltic sea city of wismar . set up in 2005 , german pellets now produces 400,000 tons of wood pellets per year and sells not only to german customers , but also to denmark and sweden , according to ceo peter h. leibold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german households are increasingly turning to wood for heating , forest owners say leibold said new technology for burning pellets produces minimal ash and is as easy to operate as a conventional oil or gas system .
he said enough pellets for an entire winter are blown into a basement container and then automatically transported to the burner . " if we had the political will , germany could provide 100 per cent of its winter heating from wood , " leibold said .
made at home trees were not the only source for making pellets , he said .
millions of acres of farmland can provide straw , which is routinely ploughed under , for pellets . noting recent russian cut-offs of oil and gas , leibold said not only was wood a cheaper way to heat , but it is also a safer source . " this is energy security ... because it 's domestically produced , " he said . salm-salm noted that with only about 70 percent of annual wood volume growth in german forests being harvested each year , there is great capacity to expand wood burning heating systems .
a forester 's dream despite growing interest in wood for heating and rising timber prices , there is little danger of depleting forestry resources , said salm-salm .
german sustainable forestry laws are among the strictest in the world , he stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has strict laws to protect its forests from too much logging " you can not cut down more than grow each year , " he said . sustainable forestry was established in germany almost 300 years ago by royal saxony state forester hans carl von carlowitz with his groundbreaking book " sylvicultura oeconomica .

serbians vote sunday for a new government in polls pitting pro-western and ultra-nationalist forces against each other .
the west says serbia must now decide if it wants its future to be european . taking advantage of unseasonably warm winter weather , voters began trickling in to some of the more than 8,500 polling stations across the balkan nation , including serbs in ethnic-albanian dominated kosovo . serbia 's 6.6 million electorate , which excludes ethnic albanians in its disputed southern province , is voting for 250 parliamentary deputies from 20 political groups . serbia 's eu membership hopes at stake at stake is serbia 's hope of eventual european union membership , which hinges on belgrade 's war crimes cooperation , namely by capturing former bosnian serb general ratko mladic , who is wanted for genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratko mladic remains a sticking point between the west and serbia brussels froze talks on closer ties last year and said it would restart them only when mladic was on trial . some western officials accuse hardline nationalists in serbia 's military and police of helping mladic to hide and evade trial by the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague . " we sincerely hope the voters will turn out in large numbers and choose a european future for their country , " said british ambassador steven wordsworth . german ambassador andreas zobel said the elections " are of an extraordinary importance because they will determine the direction in which serbia wishes to develop . " the parliamentary elections come the year after the death of former autocratic president slobodan milosevic and the independence of serbia 's traditional partner montenegro in a historic referendum . " uncertain " outcome the decisive race is expected to be between president boris tadic 's reformist democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- , and conservative prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- . " these elections are a turning point between the past , old-fashioned , traditional and incapable politics and a strategy which solves problems ... and leads serbia to the eu , " tadic said during campaigning . official poll monitors , the centre for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- , said they believed the outcome of the election was one of the most " uncertain " in the country 's history . " there are some 250,000 new voters -lrb- since 2003 elections -rrb- and their ballots can be decisive as they are expected to vote for reformist forces , " the head of cesid , zoran lucic , said ahead of voting . opinion polls have shown none of the three leading parties are likely to win enough votes to form a government alone , with tadic and kostunica widely expected to put old differences behind them and join ranks in a coalition . fate of kosovo the election is set to have a strong bearing on kosovo , the un-run province of serbia that remains the most sensitive issue left over from the bloody 1990s breakup of the former yugoslavia . it comes just five days ahead of the presentation of un envoy martti ahtisaari 's plans for the status of kosovo , the ethnic-albanian majority province of serbia that has been run by the united nations since 1999 . ahtisaari , who led nine months of mostly fruitless talks between belgrade and pristina last year , chose to present his plans after the poll for fear it could boost the ultra-nationalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with serbian president tadic in berlin in dec .
2006 german chancellor angela merkel , whose country heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , said in an interview with news agency reuters this week that any decision on kosovo must bring " maximum " satisfaction to the citizens of the province without stirring unrest in serbia . " we need maximum satisfaction in kosovo but also satisfaction , or at least no turbulence , in serbia , " merkel said ahead of sunday 's serbian elections .
" first we want to see the democratic powers in serbia strengthened after the election and then we will do everything we can to negotiate astutely while still moving ahead with political decisions . " ethnic albanians , who comprise about 90 percent of kosovo 's two million people , want nothing less than independence , a demand belgrade staunchly opposes , instead offering them wide autonomy . the major parties say they will not accept the loss of kosovo , but the democratic party of president boris tadic - the party favored by the west - has come closest to telling serbs that it might be inevitable . jaded voters despite the importance of the poll , a large number of voters are expected to abstain , fed up with politics and serbia 's protracted transition from communism , which has been delayed by the wars of the 1990s and their aftermath . more than six years since the ouster of former strongman milosevic , the impoverished country lags behind its neighbours with an average monthly salary of about 250 euros -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- and about one million unemployed . some 500 international and 5,000 local observers were monitoring the vote .

serbians vote sunday for a new government in polls pitting pro-western and ultra-nationalist forces against each other .
the west says serbia must now decide if it wants its future to be european . taking advantage of unseasonably warm winter weather , voters began trickling in to some of the more than 8,500 polling stations across the balkan nation , including serbs in ethnic-albanian dominated kosovo . serbia 's 6.6 million electorate , which excludes ethnic albanians in its disputed southern province , is voting for 250 parliamentary deputies from 20 political groups . serbia 's eu membership hopes at stake at stake is serbia 's hope of eventual european union membership , which hinges on belgrade 's war crimes cooperation , namely by capturing former bosnian serb general ratko mladic , who is wanted for genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratko mladic remains a sticking point between the west and serbia brussels froze talks on closer ties last year and said it would restart them only when mladic was on trial . some western officials accuse hardline nationalists in serbia 's military and police of helping mladic to hide and evade trial by the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague . " we sincerely hope the voters will turn out in large numbers and choose a european future for their country , " said british ambassador steven wordsworth . german ambassador andreas zobel said the elections " are of an extraordinary importance because they will determine the direction in which serbia wishes to develop . " the parliamentary elections come the year after the death of former autocratic president slobodan milosevic and the independence of serbia 's traditional partner montenegro in a historic referendum . " uncertain " outcome the decisive race is expected to be between president boris tadic 's reformist democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- , and conservative prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- . " these elections are a turning point between the past , old-fashioned , traditional and incapable politics and a strategy which solves problems ... and leads serbia to the eu , " tadic said during campaigning . official poll monitors , the centre for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- , said they believed the outcome of the election was one of the most " uncertain " in the country 's history . " there are some 250,000 new voters -lrb- since 2003 elections -rrb- and their ballots can be decisive as they are expected to vote for reformist forces , " the head of cesid , zoran lucic , said ahead of voting . opinion polls have shown none of the three leading parties are likely to win enough votes to form a government alone , with tadic and kostunica widely expected to put old differences behind them and join ranks in a coalition . fate of kosovo the election is set to have a strong bearing on kosovo , the un-run province of serbia that remains the most sensitive issue left over from the bloody 1990s breakup of the former yugoslavia . it comes just five days ahead of the presentation of un envoy martti ahtisaari 's plans for the status of kosovo , the ethnic-albanian majority province of serbia that has been run by the united nations since 1999 . ahtisaari , who led nine months of mostly fruitless talks between belgrade and pristina last year , chose to present his plans after the poll for fear it could boost the ultra-nationalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with serbian president tadic in berlin in dec .
2006 german chancellor angela merkel , whose country heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , said in an interview with news agency reuters this week that any decision on kosovo must bring " maximum " satisfaction to the citizens of the province without stirring unrest in serbia . " we need maximum satisfaction in kosovo but also satisfaction , or at least no turbulence , in serbia , " merkel said ahead of sunday 's serbian elections .
" first we want to see the democratic powers in serbia strengthened after the election and then we will do everything we can to negotiate astutely while still moving ahead with political decisions . " ethnic albanians , who comprise about 90 percent of kosovo 's two million people , want nothing less than independence , a demand belgrade staunchly opposes , instead offering them wide autonomy . the major parties say they will not accept the loss of kosovo , but the democratic party of president boris tadic - the party favored by the west - has come closest to telling serbs that it might be inevitable . jaded voters despite the importance of the poll , a large number of voters are expected to abstain , fed up with politics and serbia 's protracted transition from communism , which has been delayed by the wars of the 1990s and their aftermath . more than six years since the ouster of former strongman milosevic , the impoverished country lags behind its neighbours with an average monthly salary of about 250 euros -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- and about one million unemployed . some 500 international and 5,000 local observers were monitoring the vote .

germany is one of europe 's most densely forested countries , and soaring oil and gas prices are leading more households to switch to modern wood-burning heating systems , germany 's forest owners ' association says . " wood grows through god 's hand and no further energy is needed to produce it , " said michael prince zu salm-salm , the association 's president . one-third of germany is covered with forests despite it being the european union 's most populous country with the biggest industrial economy . germany is europe 's leading timber producer , and salm-salm said standardized wood pellets can be produced from vast numbers of small or deformed trees which are thinned from forests to allow growth of better quality timber . until recently , such trees had no economic value and were left to rot in the woods .
but salm-salm underlined that rotting wood releases the same amount of co2 - which is stored while a tree grows - as does burning the wood to produce heat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wood pellets could be the heating source of the future " this means burning wood is co2 neutral , " said salm-salm .
carbon dioxide , or co2 , emissions are widely believed to be a cause of climate change .
a growing market heating systems fuelled by wood pellets have been installed in 70,000 german buildings in recent years .
the technology - which is more expensive than oil or gas burners - is subsidized by the german government . this is still a small number out of the roughly 38 million german households .
but the sector 's growth has been explosive , starting with just 800 units nationwide in 1999 and growing to 27,000 units in 2004 . numerous factories that produce wood pellets have opened in germany in recent years , including the market leader , german pellets , based in the eastern baltic sea city of wismar . set up in 2005 , german pellets now produces 400,000 tons of wood pellets per year and sells not only to german customers , but also to denmark and sweden , according to ceo peter h. leibold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german households are increasingly turning to wood for heating , forest owners say leibold said new technology for burning pellets produces minimal ash and is as easy to operate as a conventional oil or gas system .
he said enough pellets for an entire winter are blown into a basement container and then automatically transported to the burner . " if we had the political will , germany could provide 100 per cent of its winter heating from wood , " leibold said .
made at home trees were not the only source for making pellets , he said .
millions of acres of farmland can provide straw , which is routinely ploughed under , for pellets . noting recent russian cut-offs of oil and gas , leibold said not only was wood a cheaper way to heat , but it is also a safer source . " this is energy security ... because it 's domestically produced , " he said . salm-salm noted that with only about 70 percent of annual wood volume growth in german forests being harvested each year , there is great capacity to expand wood burning heating systems .
a forester 's dream despite growing interest in wood for heating and rising timber prices , there is little danger of depleting forestry resources , said salm-salm .
german sustainable forestry laws are among the strictest in the world , he stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has strict laws to protect its forests from too much logging " you can not cut down more than grow each year , " he said . sustainable forestry was established in germany almost 300 years ago by royal saxony state forester hans carl von carlowitz with his groundbreaking book " sylvicultura oeconomica .

" i would have liked to have seen a clearer declaration on the christian roots -lrb- of europe -rrb- , " she said . " no one doubts that they significantly shape our life , our society , " the chancellor said . " i wonder , can we maintain the formative aspects of christianity for day-to-day politics if the political sphere does not stand by them ? " merkel vows to revive eu charter the comments come days after merkel outlined her plans to jumpstart the stalled bid to establish a first-ever constitution for the eu , whose presidency germany holds through june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has welcomed merkel 's push to revive the embattled eu charter she has said she would like to maintain as much as possible of the current draft treaty , which has been in the deep freeze since voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in referendums in 2005 .
merkel wants the eu to approve a revised version of the constitution draft by early 2009 . separately , eu commission president jose manuel barroso said he hoped germany 's eu presidency would yield more than a calendar for reviving the constitution . " i hope that , in addition to the road map , a clearer delineation of what the goal is can be achieved .
that is , a clearer definition of what each member state must achieve , " barroso said in an interview with german television station n-tv . critics say christian reference would exclude many the vatican and other church organizations have expressed regret that the document does not include an explicit reference to europe 's judeo-christian origins . but critics warned that such a reference would exclude european muslims and potential member state turkey , which is predominantly muslim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reference to the eu 's christian roots would sit uneasily with largely muslim turkey , an eu aspirant merkel 's conservative christian union bloc favors a " privileged partnership " with turkey as opposed to full eu membership .
but it has agreed to support the eu 's ongoing accession negotiations with ankara as part of her government 's coalition agreement with the center-left social democrats . last year merkel was among the eu politicians campaigning for a more explicit reference to europe 's christian roots . plans to include such a reference were originally blocked by french president jacques chirac .
some german officials hope french conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy , who has criticized france 's official secularism as too rigid , may support their campaign . sarkozy has also argued against allowing turkey , a predominantly muslim country , to join the eu . merkel : eu not a " christian club " although merkel has said it is vital to acknowledge europe 's christian heritage , she stresses that europe is a diverse continent .
merkel said the eu was not a " christian club " but was a " club of values . " " we will never accept positions that say that the dignity of human beings can be violated or that men and women should have different opportunities to develop .
europe must be ready to stand by these values and fight for them .

germany is one of europe 's most densely forested countries , and soaring oil and gas prices are leading more households to switch to modern wood-burning heating systems , germany 's forest owners ' association says . " wood grows through god 's hand and no further energy is needed to produce it , " said michael prince zu salm-salm , the association 's president . one-third of germany is covered with forests despite it being the european union 's most populous country with the biggest industrial economy . germany is europe 's leading timber producer , and salm-salm said standardized wood pellets can be produced from vast numbers of small or deformed trees which are thinned from forests to allow growth of better quality timber . until recently , such trees had no economic value and were left to rot in the woods .
but salm-salm underlined that rotting wood releases the same amount of co2 - which is stored while a tree grows - as does burning the wood to produce heat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wood pellets could be the heating source of the future " this means burning wood is co2 neutral , " said salm-salm .
carbon dioxide , or co2 , emissions are widely believed to be a cause of climate change .
a growing market heating systems fuelled by wood pellets have been installed in 70,000 german buildings in recent years .
the technology - which is more expensive than oil or gas burners - is subsidized by the german government . this is still a small number out of the roughly 38 million german households .
but the sector 's growth has been explosive , starting with just 800 units nationwide in 1999 and growing to 27,000 units in 2004 . numerous factories that produce wood pellets have opened in germany in recent years , including the market leader , german pellets , based in the eastern baltic sea city of wismar . set up in 2005 , german pellets now produces 400,000 tons of wood pellets per year and sells not only to german customers , but also to denmark and sweden , according to ceo peter h. leibold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german households are increasingly turning to wood for heating , forest owners say leibold said new technology for burning pellets produces minimal ash and is as easy to operate as a conventional oil or gas system .
he said enough pellets for an entire winter are blown into a basement container and then automatically transported to the burner . " if we had the political will , germany could provide 100 per cent of its winter heating from wood , " leibold said .
made at home trees were not the only source for making pellets , he said .
millions of acres of farmland can provide straw , which is routinely ploughed under , for pellets . noting recent russian cut-offs of oil and gas , leibold said not only was wood a cheaper way to heat , but it is also a safer source . " this is energy security ... because it 's domestically produced , " he said . salm-salm noted that with only about 70 percent of annual wood volume growth in german forests being harvested each year , there is great capacity to expand wood burning heating systems .

merkel said there was a need to improve communication with russia . merkel said : " communication on certain issues must be better to avoid irritations .

" europe does not have an interest in one of the sides , let 's say belgrade , having to accept a decision that is humiliating for the serbian people , " putin said . russia , a traditional ally of serbia , has opposed independence , warning that this could lead to instability in other breakaway territories .

germany is one of europe 's most densely forested countries , and soaring oil and gas prices are leading more households to switch to modern wood-burning heating systems , germany 's forest owners ' association says . " wood grows through god 's hand and no further energy is needed to produce it , " said michael prince zu salm-salm , the association 's president . one-third of germany is covered with forests despite it being the european union 's most populous country with the biggest industrial economy . germany is europe 's leading timber producer , and salm-salm said standardized wood pellets can be produced from vast numbers of small or deformed trees which are thinned from forests to allow growth of better quality timber . until recently , such trees had no economic value and were left to rot in the woods .
but salm-salm underlined that rotting wood releases the same amount of co2 - which is stored while a tree grows - as does burning the wood to produce heat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wood pellets could be the heating source of the future " this means burning wood is co2 neutral , " said salm-salm .
carbon dioxide , or co2 , emissions are widely believed to be a cause of climate change .
a growing market heating systems fuelled by wood pellets have been installed in 70,000 german buildings in recent years .
the technology - which is more expensive than oil or gas burners - is subsidized by the german government . this is still a small number out of the roughly 38 million german households .
but the sector 's growth has been explosive , starting with just 800 units nationwide in 1999 and growing to 27,000 units in 2004 . numerous factories that produce wood pellets have opened in germany in recent years , including the market leader , german pellets , based in the eastern baltic sea city of wismar . set up in 2005 , german pellets now produces 400,000 tons of wood pellets per year and sells not only to german customers , but also to denmark and sweden , according to ceo peter h. leibold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german households are increasingly turning to wood for heating , forest owners say leibold said new technology for burning pellets produces minimal ash and is as easy to operate as a conventional oil or gas system .
he said enough pellets for an entire winter are blown into a basement container and then automatically transported to the burner . " if we had the political will , germany could provide 100 per cent of its winter heating from wood , " leibold said .
made at home trees were not the only source for making pellets , he said .
millions of acres of farmland can provide straw , which is routinely ploughed under , for pellets . noting recent russian cut-offs of oil and gas , leibold said not only was wood a cheaper way to heat , but it is also a safer source . " this is energy security ... because it 's domestically produced , " he said . salm-salm noted that with only about 70 percent of annual wood volume growth in german forests being harvested each year , there is great capacity to expand wood burning heating systems .
a forester 's dream despite growing interest in wood for heating and rising timber prices , there is little danger of depleting forestry resources , said salm-salm .
german sustainable forestry laws are among the strictest in the world , he stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has strict laws to protect its forests from too much logging " you can not cut down more than grow each year , " he said . sustainable forestry was established in germany almost 300 years ago by royal saxony state forester hans carl von carlowitz with his groundbreaking book " sylvicultura oeconomica . " " our foresters are the envy of the world , " salm-salm said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel asks for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy german chancellor angela merkel asked the opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues .

" i would have liked to have seen a clearer declaration on the christian roots -lrb- of europe -rrb- , " she said . " no one doubts that they significantly shape our life , our society , " the chancellor said . " i wonder , can we maintain the formative aspects of christianity for day-to-day politics if the political sphere does not stand by them ? " merkel vows to revive eu charter the comments come days after merkel outlined her plans to jumpstart the stalled bid to establish a first-ever constitution for the eu , whose presidency germany holds through june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has welcomed merkel 's push to revive the embattled eu charter she has said she would like to maintain as much as possible of the current draft treaty , which has been in the deep freeze since voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in referendums in 2005 .
merkel wants the eu to approve a revised version of the constitution draft by early 2009 . separately , eu commission president jose manuel barroso said he hoped germany 's eu presidency would yield more than a calendar for reviving the constitution .

" i 'm not sorry " his father tipped off the police about his son after police released pictures of the youth caught on the security camera of a bank near the scene of the murder . " he admitted he committed the murder " in his preliminary interrogation in samsun before he was flown to istanbul , samsun 's chief prosecutor ahmet gokcinar told anatolia news agency . " i shot him after saying the friday prayers .
i 'm not sorry , " the cnn turk news channel quoted the suspect as saying in his testimony . " i read news on the internet .
he said ' i 'm from turkey but turkish blood is dirty ' and that 's why i decided to kill him . " alleged murderer 's age cause for worry six other people suspected of being linked to the assassination were detained in trabzon , and four of them were also flown to istanbul sunday . pointing to samast 's young age , dink 's lawyer raised the possibility that he might be only a hitman manipulated by others behind the scene . " the boy might have pulled the trigger , but the authorities should find those who are behind him , " erdal dogan told the aksam newspaper .
" the state should not just say ' this boy did it ' and shut up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samast 's image was captured on a security camera this sentiment was echoed in a frontpage headline in liberal daily radikal : " they got a child to kill dink . " among the detainees flown from trabzon to istanbul was a friend of samast , named as yasin hayal , who spent 11 months in jail for a 2004 bomb blast outside a mcdonalds restaurant in trabzon , in which six people were injured , media reports said . samast said in his initial testimony that hayal encouraged him to kill dink and gave him the gun that he used in the shooting , mass-circulation milliyet newspaper reported . dink charged for insulting " turkishness " dink was one of the taboo-breaking critics of the official line on the massacre of armenians in 1915-18 under the ottoman empire , which he labeled as genocide .
last year , dink was given a suspended six-month jail sentence for insulting " turkishness . " nationalists had branded him a " traitor , " and dink wrote in his recent articles that he received threats and hate mail . the samsun police also detained two men who were travelling on the same bus as samast and sent them to istanbul , anatolia reported , without saying on what suspicion they were held . agos employees identified samast as the person who came to their office about three hours before the attack , presented himself as a university student and asked to see dink , istanbul governor muammer guler said . he was turned down , and when a secretary went out about two hours later she saw him still standing in the street outside . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan hailed samast 's detention " in the name of democracy and the struggle for freedom . "
the police will also look into any possible links between dink 's assassination and the murder of an italian catholic priest in trabzon in february , erdogan said . a 16-year-old youth was jailed in october for the murder of father andrea santoro , shot dead as he prayed at the santa maria catholic church in trabzon , a nationalist stronghold . eu " appalled " by killing the journalist 's murder sent shock waves through turkey , sparking nationwide demonstrations at which the most popular chant was " we are all armenians , we are all hrants . " despite the controversies , the soft-spoken and often emotional dink had won many hearts here as a sincere activist for turkish-armenian reconciliation , who also denounced armenian radicalism and most recently a french bill to jail those who deny that the massacres constituted genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrant dink broke taboos in turkey german presidency of the european union said saturday it was shocked and appalled by the murder of dink .
referring to the 53-year-old as a " respected " journalist , the eu presidency statement said dink was a " courageous man whose journalism was marked by his strong commitment to democracy and freedom of expression . "
it also said dink was prepared to take great personal risks for his work .
" he always strove to present a balanced picture and avoided provoking confrontations .
he staunchly supported the democratic reforms in turkey , " the eu presidency statement said .
" as a result , hrant dink was held in high esteem in various sections of turkish society , as well as in europe . "

when merkel and her partners announce the compromises they 've made the following morning , it usually sounds as if the decisions were final and any more discussion was moot . but the fact is those decisions must still be approved by germany 's parliament or bundestag . some parliamentarians , including sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free democrats , find the government 's behavior unacceptable .

" i 'm not sorry " his father tipped off the police about his son after police released pictures of the youth caught on the security camera of a bank near the scene of the murder . " he admitted he committed the murder " in his preliminary interrogation in samsun before he was flown to istanbul , samsun 's chief prosecutor ahmet gokcinar told anatolia news agency . " i shot him after saying the friday prayers .
i 'm not sorry , " the cnn turk news channel quoted the suspect as saying in his testimony . " i read news on the internet .
he said ' i 'm from turkey but turkish blood is dirty ' and that 's why i decided to kill him . " alleged murderer 's age cause for worry six other people suspected of being linked to the assassination were detained in trabzon , and four of them were also flown to istanbul sunday . pointing to samast 's young age , dink 's lawyer raised the possibility that he might be only a hitman manipulated by others behind the scene . " the boy might have pulled the trigger , but the authorities should find those who are behind him , " erdal dogan told the aksam newspaper .
" the state should not just say ' this boy did it ' and shut up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samast 's image was captured on a security camera this sentiment was echoed in a frontpage headline in liberal daily radikal : " they got a child to kill dink . " among the detainees flown from trabzon to istanbul was a friend of samast , named as yasin hayal , who spent 11 months in jail for a 2004 bomb blast outside a mcdonalds restaurant in trabzon , in which six people were injured , media reports said . samast said in his initial testimony that hayal encouraged him to kill dink and gave him the gun that he used in the shooting , mass-circulation milliyet newspaper reported . dink charged for insulting " turkishness " dink was one of the taboo-breaking critics of the official line on the massacre of armenians in 1915-18 under the ottoman empire , which he labeled as genocide .
last year , dink was given a suspended six-month jail sentence for insulting " turkishness . " nationalists had branded him a " traitor , " and dink wrote in his recent articles that he received threats and hate mail . the samsun police also detained two men who were travelling on the same bus as samast and sent them to istanbul , anatolia reported , without saying on what suspicion they were held . agos employees identified samast as the person who came to their office about three hours before the attack , presented himself as a university student and asked to see dink , istanbul governor muammer guler said . he was turned down , and when a secretary went out about two hours later she saw him still standing in the street outside . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan hailed samast 's detention " in the name of democracy and the struggle for freedom . "
the police will also look into any possible links between dink 's assassination and the murder of an italian catholic priest in trabzon in february , erdogan said . a 16-year-old youth was jailed in october for the murder of father andrea santoro , shot dead as he prayed at the santa maria catholic church in trabzon , a nationalist stronghold . eu " appalled " by killing the journalist 's murder sent shock waves through turkey , sparking nationwide demonstrations at which the most popular chant was " we are all armenians , we are all hrants . " despite the controversies , the soft-spoken and often emotional dink had won many hearts here as a sincere activist for turkish-armenian reconciliation , who also denounced armenian radicalism and most recently a french bill to jail those who deny that the massacres constituted genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrant dink broke taboos in turkey german presidency of the european union said saturday it was shocked and appalled by the murder of dink .
referring to the 53-year-old as a " respected " journalist , the eu presidency statement said dink was a " courageous man whose journalism was marked by his strong commitment to democracy and freedom of expression . "
it also said dink was prepared to take great personal risks for his work .
" he always strove to present a balanced picture and avoided provoking confrontations .
he staunchly supported the democratic reforms in turkey , " the eu presidency statement said .
" as a result , hrant dink was held in high esteem in various sections of turkish society , as well as in europe . "

but ever more lawmakers are complaining about heavy pressure to quickly pass into law bills drafted sloppily by the federal government . when the light burns at the german chancellery late into the night , angela merkel is likely meeting with decision-makers in the governing coalition of her conservatives and the social democrats to wheel and deal . that 's often when new legislation is drafted , such as increasing the retirement age to 67 , introducing subsidies for new parents or drafting healthcare system reform .
when merkel and her partners announce the compromises they 've made the following morning , it usually sounds as if the decisions were final and any more discussion was moot . but the fact is those decisions must still be approved by germany 's parliament or bundestag . some parliamentarians , including sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free democrats , find the government 's behavior unacceptable . " it happens according to the principle : so much has been discussed outside parliament … and now the bundestag should n't dare to hold up such an important reform project , too - it must now be quickly waved through , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .

but that 's hardly possible , even for the parliamentary groups whose parties make up the governing coalition , according to parliamentarian andrea nahles , a social democrat . " because the two heads of the parties have clearly already committed themselves publicly , " nahles said .
" and if you then want to make changes , then you always end up in the predicament that you have to damage your own people .
and as such , the opportunity to undertake substantial changes to legislation has simply declined . political decisions are increasingly made outside of parliament , rather than in the bundestag , nahles said . " my theory is : the parties or the leadership of the parties , as the case may be , have gained in importance in relation to the parliamentary groups , that is , the parliament , " she added .
under pressure representatives from industry , trade unions and other lobby groups also sit in on top level negotiations sometimes .

sometimes the lawmakers did n't even receive the necessary papers in time , leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
help from other instances " for such complex projects , for bills of around 600 pages , like now with healthcare system reform , one simply needs a bit of time , " she said .

when merkel and her partners announce the compromises they 've made the following morning , it usually sounds as if the decisions were final and any more discussion was moot . but the fact is those decisions must still be approved by germany 's parliament or bundestag . some parliamentarians , including sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free democrats , find the government 's behavior unacceptable .

germany is one of europe 's most densely forested countries , and soaring oil and gas prices are leading more households to switch to modern wood-burning heating systems , germany 's forest owners ' association says . " wood grows through god 's hand and no further energy is needed to produce it , " said michael prince zu salm-salm , the association 's president . one-third of germany is covered with forests despite it being the european union 's most populous country with the biggest industrial economy . germany is europe 's leading timber producer , and salm-salm said standardized wood pellets can be produced from vast numbers of small or deformed trees which are thinned from forests to allow growth of better quality timber . until recently , such trees had no economic value and were left to rot in the woods .
but salm-salm underlined that rotting wood releases the same amount of co2 - which is stored while a tree grows - as does burning the wood to produce heat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wood pellets could be the heating source of the future " this means burning wood is co2 neutral , " said salm-salm .
carbon dioxide , or co2 , emissions are widely believed to be a cause of climate change .
a growing market heating systems fuelled by wood pellets have been installed in 70,000 german buildings in recent years .
the technology - which is more expensive than oil or gas burners - is subsidized by the german government . this is still a small number out of the roughly 38 million german households .
but the sector 's growth has been explosive , starting with just 800 units nationwide in 1999 and growing to 27,000 units in 2004 . numerous factories that produce wood pellets have opened in germany in recent years , including the market leader , german pellets , based in the eastern baltic sea city of wismar . set up in 2005 , german pellets now produces 400,000 tons of wood pellets per year and sells not only to german customers , but also to denmark and sweden , according to ceo peter h. leibold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german households are increasingly turning to wood for heating , forest owners say leibold said new technology for burning pellets produces minimal ash and is as easy to operate as a conventional oil or gas system .
he said enough pellets for an entire winter are blown into a basement container and then automatically transported to the burner . " if we had the political will , germany could provide 100 per cent of its winter heating from wood , " leibold said .
made at home trees were not the only source for making pellets , he said .
millions of acres of farmland can provide straw , which is routinely ploughed under , for pellets . noting recent russian cut-offs of oil and gas , leibold said not only was wood a cheaper way to heat , but it is also a safer source . " this is energy security ... because it 's domestically produced , " he said . salm-salm noted that with only about 70 percent of annual wood volume growth in german forests being harvested each year , there is great capacity to expand wood burning heating systems .
a forester 's dream despite growing interest in wood for heating and rising timber prices , there is little danger of depleting forestry resources , said salm-salm .
german sustainable forestry laws are among the strictest in the world , he stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has strict laws to protect its forests from too much logging " you can not cut down more than grow each year , " he said . sustainable forestry was established in germany almost 300 years ago by royal saxony state forester hans carl von carlowitz with his groundbreaking book " sylvicultura oeconomica .

germany is one of europe 's most densely forested countries , and soaring oil and gas prices are leading more households to switch to modern wood-burning heating systems , germany 's forest owners ' association says . " wood grows through god 's hand and no further energy is needed to produce it , " said michael prince zu salm-salm , the association 's president . one-third of germany is covered with forests despite it being the european union 's most populous country with the biggest industrial economy . germany is europe 's leading timber producer , and salm-salm said standardized wood pellets can be produced from vast numbers of small or deformed trees which are thinned from forests to allow growth of better quality timber . until recently , such trees had no economic value and were left to rot in the woods .
but salm-salm underlined that rotting wood releases the same amount of co2 - which is stored while a tree grows - as does burning the wood to produce heat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wood pellets could be the heating source of the future " this means burning wood is co2 neutral , " said salm-salm .
carbon dioxide , or co2 , emissions are widely believed to be a cause of climate change .
a growing market heating systems fuelled by wood pellets have been installed in 70,000 german buildings in recent years .
the technology - which is more expensive than oil or gas burners - is subsidized by the german government . this is still a small number out of the roughly 38 million german households .
but the sector 's growth has been explosive , starting with just 800 units nationwide in 1999 and growing to 27,000 units in 2004 . numerous factories that produce wood pellets have opened in germany in recent years , including the market leader , german pellets , based in the eastern baltic sea city of wismar . set up in 2005 , german pellets now produces 400,000 tons of wood pellets per year and sells not only to german customers , but also to denmark and sweden , according to ceo peter h. leibold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german households are increasingly turning to wood for heating , forest owners say leibold said new technology for burning pellets produces minimal ash and is as easy to operate as a conventional oil or gas system .
he said enough pellets for an entire winter are blown into a basement container and then automatically transported to the burner . " if we had the political will , germany could provide 100 per cent of its winter heating from wood , " leibold said .
made at home trees were not the only source for making pellets , he said .
millions of acres of farmland can provide straw , which is routinely ploughed under , for pellets . noting recent russian cut-offs of oil and gas , leibold said not only was wood a cheaper way to heat , but it is also a safer source . " this is energy security ... because it 's domestically produced , " he said . salm-salm noted that with only about 70 percent of annual wood volume growth in german forests being harvested each year , there is great capacity to expand wood burning heating systems .
a forester 's dream despite growing interest in wood for heating and rising timber prices , there is little danger of depleting forestry resources , said salm-salm .
german sustainable forestry laws are among the strictest in the world , he stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has strict laws to protect its forests from too much logging " you can not cut down more than grow each year , " he said . sustainable forestry was established in germany almost 300 years ago by royal saxony state forester hans carl von carlowitz with his groundbreaking book " sylvicultura oeconomica .

merkel said there was a need to improve communication with russia . merkel said : " communication on certain issues must be better to avoid irritations . " a new eu-russia partnership deal " could include precise mechanisms on ways to inform each other in order to avoid tensions , misunderstandings or disappointments , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was given a polite but cool reception by putin putin said russia was ready for an open dialogue on energy with europe based on all sides ' interests . " -lrb- on energy -rrb- we hope that our partners , too , will adhere to principles of equal rights and mutual respect of interests , " putin told journalists . the eu 's latest energy worries were triggered when moscow shut off the druzhba oil pipeline , which carries about 10 percent of russia 's crude exports to the bloc , because of an oil pricing dispute with transit country belarus . though supplies were resumed within days , the incident highlighted europe 's heavy reliance on russian gas supplies and sparked off a new debate on energy security . putin says kosovo 's future is internal matter the two leaders also touched on a host of other issues , chiefly the ongoing serbian election , international diplomacy in the balkans and the fate of the kosovo province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a traditional ally of serbia serbia voted on sunday for a new government in polls pitting pro-western forces against ultra-nationalists as a decision on the future of the country 's breakaway province of kosovo looms . putin warned that a decision on the future status of kosovo must not be imposed from the outside and should be accepted both in belgrade and pristina . " russia believes it is unacceptable that a decision on the status of kosovo be imposed from the outside , " putin said . " a long-term resolution of the problem can be achieved only if it is acceptable both to belgrade and to pristina , " putin said .
" europe does not have an interest in one of the sides , let 's say belgrade , having to accept a decision that is humiliating for the serbian people , " putin said . russia , a traditional ally of serbia , has opposed independence , warning that this could lead to instability in other breakaway territories . " if we ignore territorial integrity ... then other peoples will have the right to say ' we 're going to do the same , " ' putin said .
" this is n't just in the post-soviet world but also in other countries , including european countries . " merkel wants democratic forces in serbia strengthened earlier in the week , merkel said any decision on kosovo must bring " maximum " satisfaction to the citizens of the province without stirring unrest in serbia . on sunday , merkel reiterated her stance , saying she did not want efforts to resolve the status of kosovo to destabilize the situation in serbia . merkel added she hoped the election in serbia would strengthen democratic forces in that country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with pro-western serbian president boris tadic in berlin in dec .

serbians vote sunday for a new government in polls pitting pro-western and ultra-nationalist forces against each other .
the west says serbia must now decide if it wants its future to be european . taking advantage of unseasonably warm winter weather , voters began trickling in to some of the more than 8,500 polling stations across the balkan nation , including serbs in ethnic-albanian dominated kosovo . serbia 's 6.6 million electorate , which excludes ethnic albanians in its disputed southern province , is voting for 250 parliamentary deputies from 20 political groups . serbia 's eu membership hopes at stake at stake is serbia 's hope of eventual european union membership , which hinges on belgrade 's war crimes cooperation , namely by capturing former bosnian serb general ratko mladic , who is wanted for genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratko mladic remains a sticking point between the west and serbia brussels froze talks on closer ties last year and said it would restart them only when mladic was on trial . some western officials accuse hardline nationalists in serbia 's military and police of helping mladic to hide and evade trial by the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague . " we sincerely hope the voters will turn out in large numbers and choose a european future for their country , " said british ambassador steven wordsworth . german ambassador andreas zobel said the elections " are of an extraordinary importance because they will determine the direction in which serbia wishes to develop . " the parliamentary elections come the year after the death of former autocratic president slobodan milosevic and the independence of serbia 's traditional partner montenegro in a historic referendum . " uncertain " outcome the decisive race is expected to be between president boris tadic 's reformist democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- , and conservative prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- . " these elections are a turning point between the past , old-fashioned , traditional and incapable politics and a strategy which solves problems ... and leads serbia to the eu , " tadic said during campaigning . official poll monitors , the centre for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- , said they believed the outcome of the election was one of the most " uncertain " in the country 's history . " there are some 250,000 new voters -lrb- since 2003 elections -rrb- and their ballots can be decisive as they are expected to vote for reformist forces , " the head of cesid , zoran lucic , said ahead of voting . opinion polls have shown none of the three leading parties are likely to win enough votes to form a government alone , with tadic and kostunica widely expected to put old differences behind them and join ranks in a coalition . fate of kosovo the election is set to have a strong bearing on kosovo , the un-run province of serbia that remains the most sensitive issue left over from the bloody 1990s breakup of the former yugoslavia . it comes just five days ahead of the presentation of un envoy martti ahtisaari 's plans for the status of kosovo , the ethnic-albanian majority province of serbia that has been run by the united nations since 1999 . ahtisaari , who led nine months of mostly fruitless talks between belgrade and pristina last year , chose to present his plans after the poll for fear it could boost the ultra-nationalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with serbian president tadic in berlin in dec .
2006 german chancellor angela merkel , whose country heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , said in an interview with news agency reuters this week that any decision on kosovo must bring " maximum " satisfaction to the citizens of the province without stirring unrest in serbia . " we need maximum satisfaction in kosovo but also satisfaction , or at least no turbulence , in serbia , " merkel said ahead of sunday 's serbian elections .
" first we want to see the democratic powers in serbia strengthened after the election and then we will do everything we can to negotiate astutely while still moving ahead with political decisions . " ethnic albanians , who comprise about 90 percent of kosovo 's two million people , want nothing less than independence , a demand belgrade staunchly opposes , instead offering them wide autonomy . the major parties say they will not accept the loss of kosovo , but the democratic party of president boris tadic - the party favored by the west - has come closest to telling serbs that it might be inevitable . jaded voters despite the importance of the poll , a large number of voters are expected to abstain , fed up with politics and serbia 's protracted transition from communism , which has been delayed by the wars of the 1990s and their aftermath . more than six years since the ouster of former strongman milosevic , the impoverished country lags behind its neighbours with an average monthly salary of about 250 euros -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- and about one million unemployed . some 500 international and 5,000 local observers were monitoring the vote .

merkel said there was a need to improve communication with russia . merkel said : " communication on certain issues must be better to avoid irritations . " a new eu-russia partnership deal " could include precise mechanisms on ways to inform each other in order to avoid tensions , misunderstandings or disappointments , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was given a polite but cool reception by putin putin said russia was ready for an open dialogue on energy with europe based on all sides ' interests . " -lrb- on energy -rrb- we hope that our partners , too , will adhere to principles of equal rights and mutual respect of interests , " putin told journalists . the eu 's latest energy worries were triggered when moscow shut off the druzhba oil pipeline , which carries about 10 percent of russia 's crude exports to the bloc , because of an oil pricing dispute with transit country belarus . though supplies were resumed within days , the incident highlighted europe 's heavy reliance on russian gas supplies and sparked off a new debate on energy security . putin says kosovo 's future is internal matter the two leaders also touched on a host of other issues , chiefly the ongoing serbian election , international diplomacy in the balkans and the fate of the kosovo province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a traditional ally of serbia serbia voted on sunday for a new government in polls pitting pro-western forces against ultra-nationalists as a decision on the future of the country 's breakaway province of kosovo looms . putin warned that a decision on the future status of kosovo must not be imposed from the outside and should be accepted both in belgrade and pristina . " russia believes it is unacceptable that a decision on the status of kosovo be imposed from the outside , " putin said . " a long-term resolution of the problem can be achieved only if it is acceptable both to belgrade and to pristina , " putin said .
" europe does not have an interest in one of the sides , let 's say belgrade , having to accept a decision that is humiliating for the serbian people , " putin said . russia , a traditional ally of serbia , has opposed independence , warning that this could lead to instability in other breakaway territories . " if we ignore territorial integrity ... then other peoples will have the right to say ' we 're going to do the same , " ' putin said .
" this is n't just in the post-soviet world but also in other countries , including european countries . " merkel wants democratic forces in serbia strengthened earlier in the week , merkel said any decision on kosovo must bring " maximum " satisfaction to the citizens of the province without stirring unrest in serbia . on sunday , merkel reiterated her stance , saying she did not want efforts to resolve the status of kosovo to destabilize the situation in serbia . merkel added she hoped the election in serbia would strengthen democratic forces in that country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with pro-western serbian president boris tadic in berlin in dec .

" i 'm not sorry " his father tipped off the police about his son after police released pictures of the youth caught on the security camera of a bank near the scene of the murder . " he admitted he committed the murder " in his preliminary interrogation in samsun before he was flown to istanbul , samsun 's chief prosecutor ahmet gokcinar told anatolia news agency . " i shot him after saying the friday prayers .
i 'm not sorry , " the cnn turk news channel quoted the suspect as saying in his testimony . " i read news on the internet .
he said ' i 'm from turkey but turkish blood is dirty ' and that 's why i decided to kill him . " alleged murderer 's age cause for worry six other people suspected of being linked to the assassination were detained in trabzon , and four of them were also flown to istanbul sunday . pointing to samast 's young age , dink 's lawyer raised the possibility that he might be only a hitman manipulated by others behind the scene . " the boy might have pulled the trigger , but the authorities should find those who are behind him , " erdal dogan told the aksam newspaper .
" the state should not just say ' this boy did it ' and shut up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samast 's image was captured on a security camera this sentiment was echoed in a frontpage headline in liberal daily radikal : " they got a child to kill dink . " among the detainees flown from trabzon to istanbul was a friend of samast , named as yasin hayal , who spent 11 months in jail for a 2004 bomb blast outside a mcdonalds restaurant in trabzon , in which six people were injured , media reports said . samast said in his initial testimony that hayal encouraged him to kill dink and gave him the gun that he used in the shooting , mass-circulation milliyet newspaper reported . dink charged for insulting " turkishness " dink was one of the taboo-breaking critics of the official line on the massacre of armenians in 1915-18 under the ottoman empire , which he labeled as genocide .
last year , dink was given a suspended six-month jail sentence for insulting " turkishness . " nationalists had branded him a " traitor , " and dink wrote in his recent articles that he received threats and hate mail . the samsun police also detained two men who were travelling on the same bus as samast and sent them to istanbul , anatolia reported , without saying on what suspicion they were held . agos employees identified samast as the person who came to their office about three hours before the attack , presented himself as a university student and asked to see dink , istanbul governor muammer guler said . he was turned down , and when a secretary went out about two hours later she saw him still standing in the street outside . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan hailed samast 's detention " in the name of democracy and the struggle for freedom . "
the police will also look into any possible links between dink 's assassination and the murder of an italian catholic priest in trabzon in february , erdogan said . a 16-year-old youth was jailed in october for the murder of father andrea santoro , shot dead as he prayed at the santa maria catholic church in trabzon , a nationalist stronghold . eu " appalled " by killing the journalist 's murder sent shock waves through turkey , sparking nationwide demonstrations at which the most popular chant was " we are all armenians , we are all hrants . " despite the controversies , the soft-spoken and often emotional dink had won many hearts here as a sincere activist for turkish-armenian reconciliation , who also denounced armenian radicalism and most recently a french bill to jail those who deny that the massacres constituted genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrant dink broke taboos in turkey german presidency of the european union said saturday it was shocked and appalled by the murder of dink .
referring to the 53-year-old as a " respected " journalist , the eu presidency statement said dink was a " courageous man whose journalism was marked by his strong commitment to democracy and freedom of expression . "
it also said dink was prepared to take great personal risks for his work .
" he always strove to present a balanced picture and avoided provoking confrontations .
he staunchly supported the democratic reforms in turkey , " the eu presidency statement said .

but ever more lawmakers are complaining about heavy pressure to quickly pass into law bills drafted sloppily by the federal government . when the light burns at the german chancellery late into the night , angela merkel is likely meeting with decision-makers in the governing coalition of her conservatives and the social democrats to wheel and deal . that 's often when new legislation is drafted , such as increasing the retirement age to 67 , introducing subsidies for new parents or drafting healthcare system reform .
when merkel and her partners announce the compromises they 've made the following morning , it usually sounds as if the decisions were final and any more discussion was moot . but the fact is those decisions must still be approved by germany 's parliament or bundestag . some parliamentarians , including sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free democrats , find the government 's behavior unacceptable . " it happens according to the principle : so much has been discussed outside parliament … and now the bundestag should n't dare to hold up such an important reform project , too - it must now be quickly waved through , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" it 's very difficult as a parliamentarian - especially in the opposition - to play a part .
difficulties for governing parties , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : announcing another compromise : merkel and the other coalition parties ' heads it 's parliamentarians ' job to examine bills submitted by the government and formulate changes in plenary sessions and committees .
but that 's hardly possible , even for the parliamentary groups whose parties make up the governing coalition , according to parliamentarian andrea nahles , a social democrat . " because the two heads of the parties have clearly already committed themselves publicly , " nahles said .
" and if you then want to make changes , then you always end up in the predicament that you have to damage your own people .
and as such , the opportunity to undertake substantial changes to legislation has simply declined . political decisions are increasingly made outside of parliament , rather than in the bundestag , nahles said . " my theory is : the parties or the leadership of the parties , as the case may be , have gained in importance in relation to the parliamentary groups , that is , the parliament , " she added .
under pressure representatives from industry , trade unions and other lobby groups also sit in on top level negotiations sometimes .
they voice their wishes or issue policy papers that quickly become the basis for bills that hardly differ from them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians feel left out when the coalition huddles leutheusser-schnarrenberger said she had observed such machinations for years , but now , with the grand coalition of germany 's biggest political parties leading the country , it had become more dramatic . on top of that , the government was increasingly demanding deadlines by which parliamentarians were expected to deal with new bills .
sometimes the lawmakers did n't even receive the necessary papers in time , leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
help from other instances " for such complex projects , for bills of around 600 pages , like now with healthcare system reform , one simply needs a bit of time , " she said .
" as a parliamentarian , i would naturally reject such a law , i do n't see any alternative .
i think many of the parliamentarians from the -lrb- ruling parties -rrb- do n't know exactly what is written all over those 600 pages either . " that 's how poorly written laws have been passed that lawmakers have n't had the time to study and which were not adequately discussed within the parliamentary groups , she added . leutheusser-schnarrenberger has pinned her hopes on the grand coalition not being re-elected .
until then she said she relied on germany 's president and its highest legal instance , the constitutional court , to halt the government 's sloppy laws . monika dittrich -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to introduce health care for all health insurance will become obligatory for all german citizens in the wake of a landmark reform of the country 's healthcare system to come into effect in april .

merkel said there was a need to improve communication with russia . merkel said : " communication on certain issues must be better to avoid irritations .

" -lrb- on energy -rrb- we hope that our partners , too , will adhere to principles of equal rights and mutual respect of interests , " putin told journalists . the eu 's latest energy worries were triggered when moscow shut off the druzhba oil pipeline , which carries about 10 percent of russia 's crude exports to the bloc , because of an oil pricing dispute with transit country belarus . though supplies were resumed within days , the incident highlighted europe 's heavy reliance on russian gas supplies and sparked off a new debate on energy security . putin says kosovo 's future is internal matter the two leaders also touched on a host of other issues , chiefly the ongoing serbian election , international diplomacy in the balkans and the fate of the kosovo province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a traditional ally of serbia serbia voted on sunday for a new government in polls pitting pro-western forces against ultra-nationalists as a decision on the future of the country 's breakaway province of kosovo looms . putin warned that a decision on the future status of kosovo must not be imposed from the outside and should be accepted both in belgrade and pristina . " russia believes it is unacceptable that a decision on the status of kosovo be imposed from the outside , " putin said . " a long-term resolution of the problem can be achieved only if it is acceptable both to belgrade and to pristina , " putin said .
" europe does not have an interest in one of the sides , let 's say belgrade , having to accept a decision that is humiliating for the serbian people , " putin said . russia , a traditional ally of serbia , has opposed independence , warning that this could lead to instability in other breakaway territories . " if we ignore territorial integrity ... then other peoples will have the right to say ' we 're going to do the same , " ' putin said .
" this is n't just in the post-soviet world but also in other countries , including european countries . " merkel wants democratic forces in serbia strengthened earlier in the week , merkel said any decision on kosovo must bring " maximum " satisfaction to the citizens of the province without stirring unrest in serbia . on sunday , merkel reiterated her stance , saying she did not want efforts to resolve the status of kosovo to destabilize the situation in serbia . merkel added she hoped the election in serbia would strengthen democratic forces in that country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with pro-western serbian president boris tadic in berlin in dec .

serbians vote sunday for a new government in polls pitting pro-western and ultra-nationalist forces against each other .
the west says serbia must now decide if it wants its future to be european . taking advantage of unseasonably warm winter weather , voters began trickling in to some of the more than 8,500 polling stations across the balkan nation , including serbs in ethnic-albanian dominated kosovo . serbia 's 6.6 million electorate , which excludes ethnic albanians in its disputed southern province , is voting for 250 parliamentary deputies from 20 political groups . serbia 's eu membership hopes at stake at stake is serbia 's hope of eventual european union membership , which hinges on belgrade 's war crimes cooperation , namely by capturing former bosnian serb general ratko mladic , who is wanted for genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratko mladic remains a sticking point between the west and serbia brussels froze talks on closer ties last year and said it would restart them only when mladic was on trial . some western officials accuse hardline nationalists in serbia 's military and police of helping mladic to hide and evade trial by the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague . " we sincerely hope the voters will turn out in large numbers and choose a european future for their country , " said british ambassador steven wordsworth . german ambassador andreas zobel said the elections " are of an extraordinary importance because they will determine the direction in which serbia wishes to develop . " the parliamentary elections come the year after the death of former autocratic president slobodan milosevic and the independence of serbia 's traditional partner montenegro in a historic referendum . " uncertain " outcome the decisive race is expected to be between president boris tadic 's reformist democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- , and conservative prime minister vojislav kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- . " these elections are a turning point between the past , old-fashioned , traditional and incapable politics and a strategy which solves problems ... and leads serbia to the eu , " tadic said during campaigning . official poll monitors , the centre for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- , said they believed the outcome of the election was one of the most " uncertain " in the country 's history . " there are some 250,000 new voters -lrb- since 2003 elections -rrb- and their ballots can be decisive as they are expected to vote for reformist forces , " the head of cesid , zoran lucic , said ahead of voting . opinion polls have shown none of the three leading parties are likely to win enough votes to form a government alone , with tadic and kostunica widely expected to put old differences behind them and join ranks in a coalition . fate of kosovo the election is set to have a strong bearing on kosovo , the un-run province of serbia that remains the most sensitive issue left over from the bloody 1990s breakup of the former yugoslavia . it comes just five days ahead of the presentation of un envoy martti ahtisaari 's plans for the status of kosovo , the ethnic-albanian majority province of serbia that has been run by the united nations since 1999 . ahtisaari , who led nine months of mostly fruitless talks between belgrade and pristina last year , chose to present his plans after the poll for fear it could boost the ultra-nationalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with serbian president tadic in berlin in dec .
2006 german chancellor angela merkel , whose country heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , said in an interview with news agency reuters this week that any decision on kosovo must bring " maximum " satisfaction to the citizens of the province without stirring unrest in serbia . " we need maximum satisfaction in kosovo but also satisfaction , or at least no turbulence , in serbia , " merkel said ahead of sunday 's serbian elections .
" first we want to see the democratic powers in serbia strengthened after the election and then we will do everything we can to negotiate astutely while still moving ahead with political decisions . " ethnic albanians , who comprise about 90 percent of kosovo 's two million people , want nothing less than independence , a demand belgrade staunchly opposes , instead offering them wide autonomy . the major parties say they will not accept the loss of kosovo , but the democratic party of president boris tadic - the party favored by the west - has come closest to telling serbs that it might be inevitable . jaded voters despite the importance of the poll , a large number of voters are expected to abstain , fed up with politics and serbia 's protracted transition from communism , which has been delayed by the wars of the 1990s and their aftermath . more than six years since the ouster of former strongman milosevic , the impoverished country lags behind its neighbours with an average monthly salary of about 250 euros -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- and about one million unemployed . some 500 international and 5,000 local observers were monitoring the vote .
unofficial preliminary results were expected late sunday , while the final outcome is to be presented by january 25 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu may accept extra kosovo status talks after serbian elections wary of a un security council veto from russia , the eu appears ready to allow more time for talks on the future status of kosovo after serbia elects its new parliament on sunday .

serbians vote sunday for a new government in polls pitting pro-western and ultra-nationalist forces against each other .
the west says serbia must now decide if it wants its future to be european . taking advantage of unseasonably warm winter weather , voters began trickling in to some of the more than 8,500 polling stations across the balkan nation , including serbs in ethnic-albanian dominated kosovo . serbia 's 6.6 million electorate , which excludes ethnic albanians in its disputed southern province , is voting for 250 parliamentary deputies from 20 political groups . serbia 's eu membership hopes at stake at stake is serbia 's hope of eventual european union membership , which hinges on belgrade 's war crimes cooperation , namely by capturing former bosnian serb general ratko mladic , who is wanted for genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratko mladic remains a sticking point between the west and serbia brussels froze talks on closer ties last year and said it would restart them only when mladic was on trial . some western officials accuse hardline nationalists in serbia 's military and police of helping mladic to hide and evade trial by the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague . " we sincerely hope the voters will turn out in large numbers and choose a european future for their country , " said british ambassador steven wordsworth . german ambassador andreas zobel said the elections " are of an extraordinary importance because they will determine the direction in which serbia wishes to develop . " the parliamentary elections come the year after the death of former autocratic president slobodan milosevic and the independence of serbia 's traditional partner montenegro in a historic referendum .

" these elections are a turning point between the past , old-fashioned , traditional and incapable politics and a strategy which solves problems ... and leads serbia to the eu , " tadic said during campaigning . official poll monitors , the centre for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- , said they believed the outcome of the election was one of the most " uncertain " in the country 's history .

germany is one of europe 's most densely forested countries , and soaring oil and gas prices are leading more households to switch to modern wood-burning heating systems , germany 's forest owners ' association says . " wood grows through god 's hand and no further energy is needed to produce it , " said michael prince zu salm-salm , the association 's president . one-third of germany is covered with forests despite it being the european union 's most populous country with the biggest industrial economy . germany is europe 's leading timber producer , and salm-salm said standardized wood pellets can be produced from vast numbers of small or deformed trees which are thinned from forests to allow growth of better quality timber . until recently , such trees had no economic value and were left to rot in the woods .
but salm-salm underlined that rotting wood releases the same amount of co2 - which is stored while a tree grows - as does burning the wood to produce heat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wood pellets could be the heating source of the future " this means burning wood is co2 neutral , " said salm-salm .
carbon dioxide , or co2 , emissions are widely believed to be a cause of climate change .
a growing market heating systems fuelled by wood pellets have been installed in 70,000 german buildings in recent years .
the technology - which is more expensive than oil or gas burners - is subsidized by the german government . this is still a small number out of the roughly 38 million german households .
but the sector 's growth has been explosive , starting with just 800 units nationwide in 1999 and growing to 27,000 units in 2004 . numerous factories that produce wood pellets have opened in germany in recent years , including the market leader , german pellets , based in the eastern baltic sea city of wismar . set up in 2005 , german pellets now produces 400,000 tons of wood pellets per year and sells not only to german customers , but also to denmark and sweden , according to ceo peter h. leibold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german households are increasingly turning to wood for heating , forest owners say leibold said new technology for burning pellets produces minimal ash and is as easy to operate as a conventional oil or gas system .
he said enough pellets for an entire winter are blown into a basement container and then automatically transported to the burner . " if we had the political will , germany could provide 100 per cent of its winter heating from wood , " leibold said .
made at home trees were not the only source for making pellets , he said .
millions of acres of farmland can provide straw , which is routinely ploughed under , for pellets . noting recent russian cut-offs of oil and gas , leibold said not only was wood a cheaper way to heat , but it is also a safer source . " this is energy security ... because it 's domestically produced , " he said . salm-salm noted that with only about 70 percent of annual wood volume growth in german forests being harvested each year , there is great capacity to expand wood burning heating systems .
a forester 's dream despite growing interest in wood for heating and rising timber prices , there is little danger of depleting forestry resources , said salm-salm .
german sustainable forestry laws are among the strictest in the world , he stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has strict laws to protect its forests from too much logging " you can not cut down more than grow each year , " he said . sustainable forestry was established in germany almost 300 years ago by royal saxony state forester hans carl von carlowitz with his groundbreaking book " sylvicultura oeconomica .

the msc napoli , which was holed in storms on thursday , was run aground following " serious structural failure " .
the ship is carrying almost 2,400 containers , about 150 of which are said to hold hazardous chemical substances .
fifty containers were thrown into the sea on saturday , but it is not thought they contained hazardous goods .
protective boom the ship 's 26-man crew was rescued by helicopter on thursday after it developed two long gashes on each side just above the water line in stormy weather .
the drifting vessel was being towed to portland harbour in dorset for a salvage operation , but the maritime and coastguard agency decided to beach it in lyme bay , near sidmouth , instead , following the structural failure .
it is now firmly aground but rolling in storms , an mca spokesman said .
two french coastguard tugs are holding the ship in place .
chris lawson of the environment agency said containers holding the most hazardous substances , such as pesticides , were in the cargo hold of the boat , and there was " very little risk " of them leaking .
missing goods according to the mca , 50 coastguards are out looking for the missing 40ft long containers , which include one containing hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of bmw motorbikes .
the mca spokesman said : " after discussions with devon police we are asking members of the public not to have a look because the containers washing around the ship increase the risk .
" we do n't want anyone to approach the containers , if they see them just ring the coastguard . "
the rescue team has been using the high tide to edge the napoli closer to shelter whilst weighing it down by pumping in sea water as ballast .
the ship has been surrounded by a 1km -lrb- 0.6 mile -rrb- oil-protection boom to protect the sea from any possible pollution .
mr lawson said the priority was to safeguard approximately 3,000 tonnes of fuel on board and pump it out of the vessel over the next two to three days .
an mca spokesman said the environmental sensitivities in the lyme bay area had been fully assessed before the decision to run it into the ground .
the ship 's cargo - starting with potentially hazardous materials - will now be taken ashore from the ship 's current position by salvage crews .
" the oils will be the first priority , the ship 's bunkers , fuel oil , and then the containers which are considered most hazardous first , " said the mca 's paul coley .
the 275m -lrb- 900ft -rrb- , 62,000-tonne napoli is registered in london and owned by the swiss mediterranean shipping company .
it was last inspected by the mca in may 2005 when officials said it met safety standards .

the event is being held at the same time as the world economic forum - hosted in the swiss town of davos .

and with the " anti-davos " talks taking place in nairobi , there will be an emphasis on african issues .
reflective thinking set up in 2001 , the forum is described as a platform for reflective thinking and debate , and a chance for ordinary people to exchange ideas opposed to a world dominated by capital and imperialism .
more than 80,000 people from across the globe have already converged on nairobi for event , which kicks off with an anti-poverty march .
organisers hope that , by the end of the week , it will have played host to 150,000 participants .

the world social forum will take place over the coming six days in a huge stadium and sports complex on the outskirts of the capital .
it has the motto : " peoples ' struggles , peoples ' alternatives - another world is possible " .

and with africa to be central to many of the discussions , one of the key pressing issues will be economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- .
the european union and countries in africa , the caribbean and pacific regions are currently negotiating the terms of epas .
supporters of the agreements say the will free up world trade and reduce poverty , but opponents believe they will have the opposite effect .
many people attending the nairobi forum believe they will penalise developing nations as under the deals poorer countries would have to open up their borders to duty and tariff-free goods and services from developed nations .
critics say that by lifting trade barriers , developing nations will be exposed to unfair competition from powerful and multinational companies .

and with the " anti-davos " talks taking place in nairobi , there will be an emphasis on african issues .
reflective thinking set up in 2001 , the forum is described as a platform for reflective thinking and debate , and a chance for ordinary people to exchange ideas opposed to a world dominated by capital and imperialism .
more than 80,000 people from across the globe have already converged on nairobi for event , which kicks off with an anti-poverty march .

and with africa to be central to many of the discussions , one of the key pressing issues will be economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- .
the european union and countries in africa , the caribbean and pacific regions are currently negotiating the terms of epas .
supporters of the agreements say the will free up world trade and reduce poverty , but opponents believe they will have the opposite effect .

there is a small open area called shackleton park near her house but it has been condemned and its gates are bolted .
money should be available to refurbish her local park .
a developer who built some nearby flats has agreed to pay £ 180,000 as part of the planning agreement .
but this weekend the park still remains empty , desolate and unused .
an investigation by bbc 's five live report has found the same picture emerging across england .
latest estimates suggest that £ 800m paid by developers towards community projects is instead lying idle in council coffers .
the money has been accumulated thanks to a little known planning regulation requiring a developer to give money to the council to complete projects whose aims are to improve the local area where they are building .
the legislation in question is tucked away in the 1990 town and country planning act , and is known as a section 106 agreement .
sally has met councillors and officials and even attended council meetings but she has still been unable to find out why the money has n't been spent or what she could do to make the council use it .
" it 's so frustrating .
all i want is somewhere for my kids to play and every time i look to get an answer from the council , i come away empty-handed , " she said .
lack of transparency laurie burton was frustrated at a similar problem in his home town , macclesfield and in particular the difficulty of getting answers from the council .
so he resorted to the freedom of information act .
the council eventually revealed that £ 2.5m of section 106 money had gone unspent in his borough .
the only purpose it was serving , he discovered , was that interest payments were being used to keep the cost of council tax down .
" the thing that really concerns me is that this is a specific law that says this information should be freely available to members of the public , " says laurie .
" but the problem for people like you and me is that we can go to the ombudsman and all they say is that they can work only on problems that affect just individuals .
" what i would like to see is the policing of councils working outside of the rules and if they 're not complying with the law , punish them . "
all i want is somewhere for my kids to play and every time i look to get an answer from the council , i come away empty-handed sally dolphin , salford resident section 106 agreements apply to developments of more than 15 houses .
laurie 's own investigations have uncovered that the average sum agreed is £ 170,000 in the north of england and a staggering £ 700,000 in the south east .
despite the hundreds of millions pounds unspent , the local government association says local authorities are the best agency to manage section 106 agreements .
" councils are elected to put local people first .
" they are determined to revitalize our town centres and create new homes and neighbourhoods that are attractive , safe and vibrant .
" to do this , all the money raised locally must be kept local to plough back into schools , roads and other facilities for local people . "
but the government is currently looking to take some of the responsibility away from local authorities and five live report understands that some developers are keen to bypass the councils as well , due to their own frustrations over how the agreements are managed .
five live report will be broadcast at 1100gmt on sunday 21 january .

there is a small open area called shackleton park near her house but it has been condemned and its gates are bolted .
money should be available to refurbish her local park .
a developer who built some nearby flats has agreed to pay £ 180,000 as part of the planning agreement .
but this weekend the park still remains empty , desolate and unused .
an investigation by bbc 's five live report has found the same picture emerging across england .
latest estimates suggest that £ 800m paid by developers towards community projects is instead lying idle in council coffers .
the money has been accumulated thanks to a little known planning regulation requiring a developer to give money to the council to complete projects whose aims are to improve the local area where they are building .
the legislation in question is tucked away in the 1990 town and country planning act , and is known as a section 106 agreement .
sally has met councillors and officials and even attended council meetings but she has still been unable to find out why the money has n't been spent or what she could do to make the council use it .
" it 's so frustrating .
all i want is somewhere for my kids to play and every time i look to get an answer from the council , i come away empty-handed , " she said .
lack of transparency laurie burton was frustrated at a similar problem in his home town , macclesfield and in particular the difficulty of getting answers from the council .
so he resorted to the freedom of information act .
the council eventually revealed that £ 2.5m of section 106 money had gone unspent in his borough .
the only purpose it was serving , he discovered , was that interest payments were being used to keep the cost of council tax down .
" the thing that really concerns me is that this is a specific law that says this information should be freely available to members of the public , " says laurie .
" but the problem for people like you and me is that we can go to the ombudsman and all they say is that they can work only on problems that affect just individuals .
" what i would like to see is the policing of councils working outside of the rules and if they 're not complying with the law , punish them . "
all i want is somewhere for my kids to play and every time i look to get an answer from the council , i come away empty-handed sally dolphin , salford resident section 106 agreements apply to developments of more than 15 houses .
laurie 's own investigations have uncovered that the average sum agreed is £ 170,000 in the north of england and a staggering £ 700,000 in the south east .
despite the hundreds of millions pounds unspent , the local government association says local authorities are the best agency to manage section 106 agreements .
" councils are elected to put local people first .
" they are determined to revitalize our town centres and create new homes and neighbourhoods that are attractive , safe and vibrant .
" to do this , all the money raised locally must be kept local to plough back into schools , roads and other facilities for local people . "

there is a small open area called shackleton park near her house but it has been condemned and its gates are bolted .
money should be available to refurbish her local park .
a developer who built some nearby flats has agreed to pay £ 180,000 as part of the planning agreement .
but this weekend the park still remains empty , desolate and unused .
an investigation by bbc 's five live report has found the same picture emerging across england .
latest estimates suggest that £ 800m paid by developers towards community projects is instead lying idle in council coffers .
the money has been accumulated thanks to a little known planning regulation requiring a developer to give money to the council to complete projects whose aims are to improve the local area where they are building .
the legislation in question is tucked away in the 1990 town and country planning act , and is known as a section 106 agreement .
sally has met councillors and officials and even attended council meetings but she has still been unable to find out why the money has n't been spent or what she could do to make the council use it .
" it 's so frustrating .
all i want is somewhere for my kids to play and every time i look to get an answer from the council , i come away empty-handed , " she said .
lack of transparency laurie burton was frustrated at a similar problem in his home town , macclesfield and in particular the difficulty of getting answers from the council .
so he resorted to the freedom of information act .
the council eventually revealed that £ 2.5m of section 106 money had gone unspent in his borough .
the only purpose it was serving , he discovered , was that interest payments were being used to keep the cost of council tax down .
" the thing that really concerns me is that this is a specific law that says this information should be freely available to members of the public , " says laurie .
" but the problem for people like you and me is that we can go to the ombudsman and all they say is that they can work only on problems that affect just individuals .
" what i would like to see is the policing of councils working outside of the rules and if they 're not complying with the law , punish them . "
all i want is somewhere for my kids to play and every time i look to get an answer from the council , i come away empty-handed sally dolphin , salford resident section 106 agreements apply to developments of more than 15 houses .
laurie 's own investigations have uncovered that the average sum agreed is £ 170,000 in the north of england and a staggering £ 700,000 in the south east .
despite the hundreds of millions pounds unspent , the local government association says local authorities are the best agency to manage section 106 agreements .
" councils are elected to put local people first .
" they are determined to revitalize our town centres and create new homes and neighbourhoods that are attractive , safe and vibrant .
" to do this , all the money raised locally must be kept local to plough back into schools , roads and other facilities for local people . "
but the government is currently looking to take some of the responsibility away from local authorities and five live report understands that some developers are keen to bypass the councils as well , due to their own frustrations over how the agreements are managed .

joanne hopkins , from caerphilly , will be one of 70 people joining explorer robert swan on the 15-day expedition .
the group will look at changes to the continent 's fragile eco-system and have the chance to study wildlife , including whales , dolphins and penguins .
ms hopkins , 28 , said she was looking forward to studying the effects of climate change in a " phenomenal " place .
the cardiff high school english teacher was chosen from dozens of applicants .
she leaves for antarctica on 17 february and will travel via argentina .
ms hopkins said her experiences travelling around australia had given her a " taste of adventure " but that she had never imagined going to antarctica .
joanne hopkins says she is " looking for a challenge " she said : " a friend of mine emailed me a link about the expedition from the bbc page .
i 've always been looking for a challenge and i 've been considering taking time out of teaching to do something . "
her place on the expedition , led by explorer robert swan , is being funded by renewable energy company g24i .
other organisers include cardiff council and science education charity techniquest .
the journey begins in ushuaia , argentina - the southernmost city in the world .
after several days preparation , the group will board an ice-strengthened boat and set off to explore the antarctic peninsula and king george island .
the 70 participants will take part in the opening ceremony of an antarctic education base on the island .
global warming the expedition organisers said the group would gain " first-hand knowledge " of the continent 's eco-system , observing icebergs and wildlife .
it is hoped the people on the trip will share their knowledge when they return home , becoming " ambassadors " for sustainable living .
ms hopkins added : " i 'm really looking forward to meeting robert swan and getting to grips with what 's going on out there with regards to climate change .
" the wildlife will be phenomenal , it 's going to be like another planet - it 's like nothing you 've ever seen before . "
