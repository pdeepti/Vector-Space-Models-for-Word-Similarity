a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases . in an interview with german daily die welt , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas urged germany to intensify its commitment towards cutting heat-trapping greenhouse gases and combating global warming . dimas conceded that germany is a world leader when it comes to expanding its power supply sourced from renewable energy .
but he said the country needed to catch up in other areas . dimas : german car industry needs to do more " the european union 's climate goals can only be reached if germany - europe 's biggest economy - plays along , " dimas said , adding that the car industry could definitely do more .
he underlined that the future lay in fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars and not in large fuel-guzzling ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are accused of lagging behind on environmental developments the german car industry - one of the most profitable sectors in the country - has long been under fire for failing to develop green technologies to power vehicles and focusing instead on the bottom line and on producing luxury models . in fact , the industry has been accused of trailing the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said last month . even the german government has controversially resisted pressure from the eu to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
the move was widely seen as an attempt by chancellor angela merkel 's government to protect its car industry after several companies complained of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . german leaders proud of leading role dimas ' comments are however disputed by german leaders who have long prided themselves on germany 's leading role in environmental affairs . sigmar gabriel , germany 's environment minister , on saturday pointed out that the eu had no chance of meeting its climate goals by 2012 without germany 's contribution .
gabriel stressed that his country alone was shouldering three-fourths of the bloc 's ambitious greenhouse cuts . while the eu plans to reduce its co2 emissions by eight percent against 1990 levels , germany has committed itself to cutting its levels by 21 percent , gabriel said . the environment minister also said there was agreement with the german economy ministry to provide incentives for building new power plants outfitted with modern technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still relies heavily on coal-fired power plants " in germany , we will continue to use coal because we ca n't entirely reduce our reliance on it .
but we wo n't be giving it any special privileges , " gabriel told the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , adding that energy-efficient plants will take precedence instead . coal-fired power plants are one of the biggest producers of greenhouses gases , which scientists have said are primarily responsible for global warming . bleak forecast for world climate on friday , the un published a damning report on climate change , saying that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . german leaders reacted swiftly to the bleak prognosis .
the german government would continue to pioneer climate protection , said chancellor angela merkel , who pledged to raise the issue when she hosts the next g8 summit . on saturday , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee also announced plans to compel carmakers to indicate to potential buyers in a transparent way how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- different models emitted . " wide gap between german words and actions " but germany 's perceived role as a world leader in green affairs was slammed by the country 's former environment minister and head of the un environment program , klaus töpfer who said there was a wide gap between german words and actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer has lashed out at germany 's green record in an interview with welt am sonntag , töpfer warned that " germans continue to considerably affect the climate , " saying that every german on average created ten tons of carbon dioxide each year . that may make germany 's per person carbon dioxide output only half as high as that of an average american 's but on a worldwide scale germany was in the top group of the world 's worst polluters , töpfer said . the environmental expert said the per-person co2 emissions of the french stood at below seven tons , that of a chinese just about three tons while an indian only about one ton . " the bald statistics tell us that we -lrb- germans -rrb- have to do much more -lrb- to combat global warming -rrb- , " töpfer said . " most of the reduction of greenhouse gases in germany is due to cleaning up the energy sector in the former east germany and is a consequence of german reunification , " he added .
" germany must reduce its emissions to between 60 and 80 percent , " topfer said , for which there is an " urgent need for a revolutionary change in energy consumption , whether in the economic sector or in society .

a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases . in an interview with german daily die welt , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas urged germany to intensify its commitment towards cutting heat-trapping greenhouse gases and combating global warming . dimas conceded that germany is a world leader when it comes to expanding its power supply sourced from renewable energy .
but he said the country needed to catch up in other areas . dimas : german car industry needs to do more " the european union 's climate goals can only be reached if germany - europe 's biggest economy - plays along , " dimas said , adding that the car industry could definitely do more .
he underlined that the future lay in fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars and not in large fuel-guzzling ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are accused of lagging behind on environmental developments the german car industry - one of the most profitable sectors in the country - has long been under fire for failing to develop green technologies to power vehicles and focusing instead on the bottom line and on producing luxury models . in fact , the industry has been accused of trailing the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said last month . even the german government has controversially resisted pressure from the eu to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
the move was widely seen as an attempt by chancellor angela merkel 's government to protect its car industry after several companies complained of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . german leaders proud of leading role dimas ' comments are however disputed by german leaders who have long prided themselves on germany 's leading role in environmental affairs . sigmar gabriel , germany 's environment minister , on saturday pointed out that the eu had no chance of meeting its climate goals by 2012 without germany 's contribution .
gabriel stressed that his country alone was shouldering three-fourths of the bloc 's ambitious greenhouse cuts . while the eu plans to reduce its co2 emissions by eight percent against 1990 levels , germany has committed itself to cutting its levels by 21 percent , gabriel said . the environment minister also said there was agreement with the german economy ministry to provide incentives for building new power plants outfitted with modern technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still relies heavily on coal-fired power plants " in germany , we will continue to use coal because we ca n't entirely reduce our reliance on it .
but we wo n't be giving it any special privileges , " gabriel told the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , adding that energy-efficient plants will take precedence instead . coal-fired power plants are one of the biggest producers of greenhouses gases , which scientists have said are primarily responsible for global warming . bleak forecast for world climate on friday , the un published a damning report on climate change , saying that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . german leaders reacted swiftly to the bleak prognosis .
the german government would continue to pioneer climate protection , said chancellor angela merkel , who pledged to raise the issue when she hosts the next g8 summit . on saturday , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee also announced plans to compel carmakers to indicate to potential buyers in a transparent way how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- different models emitted . " wide gap between german words and actions " but germany 's perceived role as a world leader in green affairs was slammed by the country 's former environment minister and head of the un environment program , klaus töpfer who said there was a wide gap between german words and actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer has lashed out at germany 's green record in an interview with welt am sonntag , töpfer warned that " germans continue to considerably affect the climate , " saying that every german on average created ten tons of carbon dioxide each year . that may make germany 's per person carbon dioxide output only half as high as that of an average american 's but on a worldwide scale germany was in the top group of the world 's worst polluters , töpfer said . the environmental expert said the per-person co2 emissions of the french stood at below seven tons , that of a chinese just about three tons while an indian only about one ton . " the bald statistics tell us that we -lrb- germans -rrb- have to do much more -lrb- to combat global warming -rrb- , " töpfer said . " most of the reduction of greenhouse gases in germany is due to cleaning up the energy sector in the former east germany and is a consequence of german reunification , " he added .
" germany must reduce its emissions to between 60 and 80 percent , " topfer said , for which there is an " urgent need for a revolutionary change in energy consumption , whether in the economic sector or in society . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says report underscores need to limit global warming a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .
but the us , china and russia stand accused of seeking to water down some sections .
-lrb- 06.04.07 -rrb- eu 's environmental policy flounders as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering .
-lrb- 05.04.07 -rrb- despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .
yet over 20 coal-fired power plants - major producers of greenhouse gases - are planned for germany .
-lrb- 21.03.07 -rrb- german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars .

bundesliga leaders schalke 04 welcome bottom club borussia mönchengladbach saturday looking to put last weeks defeat to bayern munich behind them while hoping that their title rivals suffer from a european hangover . schalke are two points clear of werder bremen with seven games remaining and coach mirko slomka admits his side need to start delivering better performances if the club is to win a first national title since 1958 .
" if we are to win the title , we have to improve , " said slomka . slomka 's side will be hoping european competition may have diverted the attention of two of their major challengers for the title .
fourth-placed bayern munich , whose 2-2 draw at ac milan on tuesday has left them with one foot in the champions league semi-finals , visit hanover on saturday while werder bremen , who drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in uefa cup quarter-final , first leg action on thursday , host nuremberg on sunday . schalke have some personnel problems ahead of saturday 's clash with gladbach and slomka must try and fill the void left by the suspension of fabian ernst for his fifth yellow card but , on a more positive note , serb defender mladen krstajic is back following a broken rib . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krstajic 's return will be equally celebrated krstajic has had to wear a special protective suit to help his rib recover but has finally been able to train without it .

" halil has been struggling with a groin injury for weeks , " slomka told the club 's website .
" every time he sets off on a sprint he 's in pain .
it 's a very tough and unpleasant situation for him . " what 's important is if he can say to us on friday that the pain has gone .

a pilot plant went into operation in the eastern town of jänschwalde thursday . vattenfall claims the carbon-capture plant is the first step towards co2-emission-free power generation based on coal .
the swedish-owned company built the pilot project in eastern germany where lignite mining and burning is the primary source of energy production . the jänschwalde power plant is a 1600-megawatt energy giant gobbling up more than 80 thousand tons of lignite every day .
located in the middle of the vast and barren coal fields of the eastern german state of brandenburg , it spews 25 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air - making it germany 's largest single emitter of the greenhouse gases , which are blamed for global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , a co2 sinner as of thursday , however , the technology of the last century exists side by side with that of a new era of energy production .
vattenfall europe has begun testing a plant that will capture the co2 emissions and pump them into deep rock . klaus rauscher , a member of the board of the swedish-owned company , says the technology is intended to make coal-fired power generation cleaner until alternative energy sources will be ready for commercial use .

vattenfall europe has begun testing a plant that will capture the co2 emissions and pump them into deep rock . klaus rauscher , a member of the board of the swedish-owned company , says the technology is intended to make coal-fired power generation cleaner until alternative energy sources will be ready for commercial use . " we are sitting on enough lignite here that will last us for the next 30 to 40 years , " he said .
" but it ’ s acceptable to use this resource only if we get a grip on the huge greenhouse gas emissions .
our pilot plant is capable of resolving this problem . " burying the emissions vattenfall has spent 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- on the new plant , which produces about 50 megawatts of electricity .
the plant uses a technology called oxyfuel combustion which burns lignite in pure oxygen rather than air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are we heading - fossil fuels or renewables ?
this produces only carbon dioxide and water vapour so that emissions can easily be liquified and pumped underground .
it is said to be the most cost-effective method of capturing carbon dioxide . " for us researchers it ’ s like entering uncharted territory with only our pioneering spirit to help us along , " said hans joachim krautz , who along with his research team at cottbus technical university in brandenburg , developed the process . vattenfall has yet to find proper storage facilities for the captured co2 , but claims that this should not be a problem as exhausted natural gas deposits , for example , are well suited for that . long-term solution ? critics of the technology say dumping greenhouse gases underground is not the long-term answer , and reducing emissions must take priority . but even environmentalists say that there may be little other choice for the time being . " we will continue to need fossil fuels for a while but have to make their use more climate friendly , " said manfred fischdick , vice-president of the wuppertal climate institute .
" carbon capture is one way of doing that . " if the trial runs at the jänschwalde pilot plant turn out to be successful , vattenfall plans to set up a bigger , 300 megawatt project by 2015 .

in their first public statement since their release , the sailors friday told how they were stripped , blindfolded and handcuffed as part of " psychological " intimidation during their detention . royal marine joe tindell , 21 , told how , blindfolded and their hands bound , the group at one point thought they were about to be executed and that he believed one had had his throat cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british sailors with iranian president ahmadinejad in teheran after their release the eight royal navy sailors and seven royal marines were seized as they carried out what they said were routine anti-smuggling operations near the shatt al-arab waterway that divides iraq and iran on march 23 .
tehran alleged they had entered iranian waters . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday he was releasing the 15 as a " gift " to the british people .
they returned to britain on thursday and have since been debriefed and medically assessed . iran wants " positive " response from britain as the 14 men and one woman began two weeks ' compassionate leave with their families , tehran 's ambassador to london said in an interview published saturday that britain should respond in kind to his country 's actions . rasoul movahedian told the financial times that tehran wanted london 's help in releasing five iranians held in iraq by us forces and on easing international fears about its controversial nuclear program . " we played our part and we showed our good will , " he told the business daily .
" now it is up to the british government to proceed in a positive way . " he denied ahmadinejad 's announcement was linked to the case of the iranians detained in iraq or the release monday in baghdad of an iranian diplomat kidnapped at gunpoint in iraq in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain insists its sailors were n't in iranian waters british prime minister tony blair has also insisted there were no " side " deals done to secure the 15 's release but said the behind-the-scenes diplomatic negotiations had created new lines of communication between britain and iran . movahedian said iran wanted to capitalize on this new dialogue .
" if they -lrb- the british -rrb- want to be helpful and use their influence we will welcome that .
we will welcome in general any steps that could defuse tensions in the region , " he added . sailors speak of intimidation , pressure in iran meanwhile , a british naval inquiry has been set up to establish how the 15 naval personnel came to be detained .
the sailors ' accounts of psychological and emotional torture dominated saturday 's press and media . " we had a blindfold and plastic cuffs , hands behind our backs , heads against the wall .
basically there were weapons cocking , " tindell told bbc news 24 television . " someone , i 'm not sure who , someone said , i quote , ' lads , lads , i think we 're going to get executed ' .
after that comment someone was sick and as far as i was concerned he had just had his throat cut . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair insists no deal was cut with iran over the release of the sailors the coverage was mixed with that of four british troops , two of them women , killed in southern iraq on thursday , which tempered homecoming celebrations . newspapers praised the sailors for the way they handled the situation , including not fighting back against the iranians ' superior firepower . a " suicidal firefight " when outgunned " might have started world war iii " , the sun tabloid said . and a senior iranian source close to the revolutionary guards told the guardian : " if this had been between iranian and american soldiers it could have been the beginning of an accidental war . " the guardian quoted unnamed sources as saying that britain declined a us offer to mount aggressive air patrols over the revolutionary guards . elsewhere , ahmadinejad was chided for mounting a propaganda exercise while a number of newspapers said blair 's unpopular decision to invade iraq had exposed the sailors to such risks in the first place . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's release of sailors gives hope in nuclear negotiations iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .

bundesliga leaders schalke 04 welcome bottom club borussia mönchengladbach saturday looking to put last weeks defeat to bayern munich behind them while hoping that their title rivals suffer from a european hangover . schalke are two points clear of werder bremen with seven games remaining and coach mirko slomka admits his side need to start delivering better performances if the club is to win a first national title since 1958 .
" if we are to win the title , we have to improve , " said slomka . slomka 's side will be hoping european competition may have diverted the attention of two of their major challengers for the title .
fourth-placed bayern munich , whose 2-2 draw at ac milan on tuesday has left them with one foot in the champions league semi-finals , visit hanover on saturday while werder bremen , who drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in uefa cup quarter-final , first leg action on thursday , host nuremberg on sunday . schalke have some personnel problems ahead of saturday 's clash with gladbach and slomka must try and fill the void left by the suspension of fabian ernst for his fifth yellow card but , on a more positive note , serb defender mladen krstajic is back following a broken rib . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krstajic 's return will be equally celebrated krstajic has had to wear a special protective suit to help his rib recover but has finally been able to train without it .
" i 'm not scared , " the 32-year-old said on his ditching the protection .
" it 's just a different feeling , that 's all .
i 'm still being a bit careful in the tackle , but things will be very different on saturday .
at least i can breathe properly again . " slomka must also decide whether to field halil altintop .
" halil has been struggling with a groin injury for weeks , " slomka told the club 's website .
" every time he sets off on a sprint he 's in pain .
it 's a very tough and unpleasant situation for him . " what 's important is if he can say to us on friday that the pain has gone .
that was n't the case on tuesday or on wednesday , " said slomka . schalke have 53 points from 27 matches to lead by two points from werder bremen , and by four and six points from vfb stuttgart , who travel to hamburg sv on saturday , and munich respectively . bayern loss still rankles with schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay 's fast goal stunned schalke last week schalke 's 2-0 defeat at bayern on saturday was a major blow to slomka 's men and it still rankles .
" the main thing -lrb- against gladbach -rrb- is not to concede a goal after three minutes , " said krstajic , referring to roy makaay 's goal for bayern . slomka said of the gladbach match : " things always look cut and dried on paper .
we 're top and everyone else is behind us .
so of course we 're favorites when we play the bottom side at home . " gladbach are five points adrift of safety but coach jos luhukay is not overawed by what he describes as a ' david versus goliath ' duel .
" we 'll get a lot of space in schalke and could earn a point there , " he said . schalke and gladbach have won just once in the last seven games each .
but the good news for schalke is that they have not lost at home against their opponents in 11 games , winning seven and drawing four . bremen need to take chances , says klose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose takes his chances but will bremen grabs theirs ?
second-placed bremen failed to take full advantage of schalke 's slip-up against bayern last week - playing out a drab scoreless draw at lowly energie cottbus - and desperately need a win sunday at home to sixth-placed nuremberg . " we 're not going to get many more chances , " said german international miroslav klose . nuremberg will be no easy touch as the southern germans are just one point off the uefa cup spot , currently occupied by fifth-placed bayer leverkusen , who welcome relegation-threatened vfl bochum . third-placed vfb stuttgart visit improving sv hamburg , looking to cement their champions league place . stuttgart , bayern looking to increase pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have left many rivals on the deck this season stuttgart are four points behind schalke , but just two clear of defending champions bayern .
coach armin veh said the club would rate a third-place finish and a place in europe 's top club tournament next season a success . bayern will be without willy sagnol , who is out for the season with a meniscus injury picked up in italy , against hanover .
lucio , hasan salihamidzic and owen hargreaves are also injury concerns . in other matches saturday , eintracht frankfurt welcome energie cottbus , struggling borussia dortmund visit alemannia aachen , sliding hertha berlin take on arminia bielefeld and vfl wolfsburg entertain mainz 05 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leverkusen routed while bremen keep uefa cup dream alive werder bremen could be germany 's last contender in the uefa cup by the end of next week after bayer leverkusen suffered a hugely damaging 3-0 home defeat against osasuna .

bundesliga leaders schalke 04 welcome bottom club borussia mönchengladbach saturday looking to put last weeks defeat to bayern munich behind them while hoping that their title rivals suffer from a european hangover . schalke are two points clear of werder bremen with seven games remaining and coach mirko slomka admits his side need to start delivering better performances if the club is to win a first national title since 1958 .
" if we are to win the title , we have to improve , " said slomka . slomka 's side will be hoping european competition may have diverted the attention of two of their major challengers for the title .

a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases . in an interview with german daily die welt , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas urged germany to intensify its commitment towards cutting heat-trapping greenhouse gases and combating global warming . dimas conceded that germany is a world leader when it comes to expanding its power supply sourced from renewable energy .
but he said the country needed to catch up in other areas . dimas : german car industry needs to do more " the european union 's climate goals can only be reached if germany - europe 's biggest economy - plays along , " dimas said , adding that the car industry could definitely do more .
he underlined that the future lay in fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars and not in large fuel-guzzling ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are accused of lagging behind on environmental developments the german car industry - one of the most profitable sectors in the country - has long been under fire for failing to develop green technologies to power vehicles and focusing instead on the bottom line and on producing luxury models . in fact , the industry has been accused of trailing the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said last month . even the german government has controversially resisted pressure from the eu to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
the move was widely seen as an attempt by chancellor angela merkel 's government to protect its car industry after several companies complained of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . german leaders proud of leading role dimas ' comments are however disputed by german leaders who have long prided themselves on germany 's leading role in environmental affairs . sigmar gabriel , germany 's environment minister , on saturday pointed out that the eu had no chance of meeting its climate goals by 2012 without germany 's contribution .
gabriel stressed that his country alone was shouldering three-fourths of the bloc 's ambitious greenhouse cuts . while the eu plans to reduce its co2 emissions by eight percent against 1990 levels , germany has committed itself to cutting its levels by 21 percent , gabriel said . the environment minister also said there was agreement with the german economy ministry to provide incentives for building new power plants outfitted with modern technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still relies heavily on coal-fired power plants " in germany , we will continue to use coal because we ca n't entirely reduce our reliance on it .
but we wo n't be giving it any special privileges , " gabriel told the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , adding that energy-efficient plants will take precedence instead . coal-fired power plants are one of the biggest producers of greenhouses gases , which scientists have said are primarily responsible for global warming . bleak forecast for world climate on friday , the un published a damning report on climate change , saying that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . german leaders reacted swiftly to the bleak prognosis .
the german government would continue to pioneer climate protection , said chancellor angela merkel , who pledged to raise the issue when she hosts the next g8 summit . on saturday , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee also announced plans to compel carmakers to indicate to potential buyers in a transparent way how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- different models emitted . " wide gap between german words and actions " but germany 's perceived role as a world leader in green affairs was slammed by the country 's former environment minister and head of the un environment program , klaus töpfer who said there was a wide gap between german words and actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer has lashed out at germany 's green record in an interview with welt am sonntag , töpfer warned that " germans continue to considerably affect the climate , " saying that every german on average created ten tons of carbon dioxide each year . that may make germany 's per person carbon dioxide output only half as high as that of an average american 's but on a worldwide scale germany was in the top group of the world 's worst polluters , töpfer said . the environmental expert said the per-person co2 emissions of the french stood at below seven tons , that of a chinese just about three tons while an indian only about one ton . " the bald statistics tell us that we -lrb- germans -rrb- have to do much more -lrb- to combat global warming -rrb- , " töpfer said . " most of the reduction of greenhouse gases in germany is due to cleaning up the energy sector in the former east germany and is a consequence of german reunification , " he added .
" germany must reduce its emissions to between 60 and 80 percent , " topfer said , for which there is an " urgent need for a revolutionary change in energy consumption , whether in the economic sector or in society . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says report underscores need to limit global warming a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .

a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases . in an interview with german daily die welt , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas urged germany to intensify its commitment towards cutting heat-trapping greenhouse gases and combating global warming . dimas conceded that germany is a world leader when it comes to expanding its power supply sourced from renewable energy .
but he said the country needed to catch up in other areas . dimas : german car industry needs to do more " the european union 's climate goals can only be reached if germany - europe 's biggest economy - plays along , " dimas said , adding that the car industry could definitely do more .
he underlined that the future lay in fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars and not in large fuel-guzzling ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are accused of lagging behind on environmental developments the german car industry - one of the most profitable sectors in the country - has long been under fire for failing to develop green technologies to power vehicles and focusing instead on the bottom line and on producing luxury models . in fact , the industry has been accused of trailing the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said last month . even the german government has controversially resisted pressure from the eu to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
the move was widely seen as an attempt by chancellor angela merkel 's government to protect its car industry after several companies complained of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . german leaders proud of leading role dimas ' comments are however disputed by german leaders who have long prided themselves on germany 's leading role in environmental affairs . sigmar gabriel , germany 's environment minister , on saturday pointed out that the eu had no chance of meeting its climate goals by 2012 without germany 's contribution .
gabriel stressed that his country alone was shouldering three-fourths of the bloc 's ambitious greenhouse cuts . while the eu plans to reduce its co2 emissions by eight percent against 1990 levels , germany has committed itself to cutting its levels by 21 percent , gabriel said . the environment minister also said there was agreement with the german economy ministry to provide incentives for building new power plants outfitted with modern technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still relies heavily on coal-fired power plants " in germany , we will continue to use coal because we ca n't entirely reduce our reliance on it .
but we wo n't be giving it any special privileges , " gabriel told the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , adding that energy-efficient plants will take precedence instead . coal-fired power plants are one of the biggest producers of greenhouses gases , which scientists have said are primarily responsible for global warming . bleak forecast for world climate on friday , the un published a damning report on climate change , saying that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . german leaders reacted swiftly to the bleak prognosis .
the german government would continue to pioneer climate protection , said chancellor angela merkel , who pledged to raise the issue when she hosts the next g8 summit . on saturday , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee also announced plans to compel carmakers to indicate to potential buyers in a transparent way how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- different models emitted . " wide gap between german words and actions " but germany 's perceived role as a world leader in green affairs was slammed by the country 's former environment minister and head of the un environment program , klaus töpfer who said there was a wide gap between german words and actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer has lashed out at germany 's green record in an interview with welt am sonntag , töpfer warned that " germans continue to considerably affect the climate , " saying that every german on average created ten tons of carbon dioxide each year . that may make germany 's per person carbon dioxide output only half as high as that of an average american 's but on a worldwide scale germany was in the top group of the world 's worst polluters , töpfer said . the environmental expert said the per-person co2 emissions of the french stood at below seven tons , that of a chinese just about three tons while an indian only about one ton . " the bald statistics tell us that we -lrb- germans -rrb- have to do much more -lrb- to combat global warming -rrb- , " töpfer said . " most of the reduction of greenhouse gases in germany is due to cleaning up the energy sector in the former east germany and is a consequence of german reunification , " he added .
" germany must reduce its emissions to between 60 and 80 percent , " topfer said , for which there is an " urgent need for a revolutionary change in energy consumption , whether in the economic sector or in society . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says report underscores need to limit global warming a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .
but the us , china and russia stand accused of seeking to water down some sections .
-lrb- 06.04.07 -rrb- eu 's environmental policy flounders as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering .
-lrb- 05.04.07 -rrb- despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .
yet over 20 coal-fired power plants - major producers of greenhouse gases - are planned for germany .

in their first public statement since their release , the sailors friday told how they were stripped , blindfolded and handcuffed as part of " psychological " intimidation during their detention . royal marine joe tindell , 21 , told how , blindfolded and their hands bound , the group at one point thought they were about to be executed and that he believed one had had his throat cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british sailors with iranian president ahmadinejad in teheran after their release the eight royal navy sailors and seven royal marines were seized as they carried out what they said were routine anti-smuggling operations near the shatt al-arab waterway that divides iraq and iran on march 23 .

a pilot plant went into operation in the eastern town of jänschwalde thursday . vattenfall claims the carbon-capture plant is the first step towards co2-emission-free power generation based on coal .
the swedish-owned company built the pilot project in eastern germany where lignite mining and burning is the primary source of energy production . the jänschwalde power plant is a 1600-megawatt energy giant gobbling up more than 80 thousand tons of lignite every day .
located in the middle of the vast and barren coal fields of the eastern german state of brandenburg , it spews 25 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air - making it germany 's largest single emitter of the greenhouse gases , which are blamed for global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , a co2 sinner as of thursday , however , the technology of the last century exists side by side with that of a new era of energy production .
vattenfall europe has begun testing a plant that will capture the co2 emissions and pump them into deep rock . klaus rauscher , a member of the board of the swedish-owned company , says the technology is intended to make coal-fired power generation cleaner until alternative energy sources will be ready for commercial use . " we are sitting on enough lignite here that will last us for the next 30 to 40 years , " he said .

" we are sitting on enough lignite here that will last us for the next 30 to 40 years , " he said .
" but it ’ s acceptable to use this resource only if we get a grip on the huge greenhouse gas emissions .
our pilot plant is capable of resolving this problem . " burying the emissions vattenfall has spent 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- on the new plant , which produces about 50 megawatts of electricity .
the plant uses a technology called oxyfuel combustion which burns lignite in pure oxygen rather than air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are we heading - fossil fuels or renewables ?
this produces only carbon dioxide and water vapour so that emissions can easily be liquified and pumped underground .
it is said to be the most cost-effective method of capturing carbon dioxide . " for us researchers it ’ s like entering uncharted territory with only our pioneering spirit to help us along , " said hans joachim krautz , who along with his research team at cottbus technical university in brandenburg , developed the process . vattenfall has yet to find proper storage facilities for the captured co2 , but claims that this should not be a problem as exhausted natural gas deposits , for example , are well suited for that . long-term solution ? critics of the technology say dumping greenhouse gases underground is not the long-term answer , and reducing emissions must take priority . but even environmentalists say that there may be little other choice for the time being . " we will continue to need fossil fuels for a while but have to make their use more climate friendly , " said manfred fischdick , vice-president of the wuppertal climate institute .
" carbon capture is one way of doing that . " if the trial runs at the jänschwalde pilot plant turn out to be successful , vattenfall plans to set up a bigger , 300 megawatt project by 2015 .
the first commercial co2-emission-free lignite plant , the company says , is then likely to go into operation by 2020 . hardy graupner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says report underscores need to limit global warming a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .
but the us , china and russia stand accused of seeking to water down some sections .
-lrb- 06.04.2007 -rrb- despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .
yet over 20 coal-fired power plants - major producers of greenhouse gases - are planned for germany .

dw spoke to buback 's son about the event 's legacy . founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the radical left-wing raf rose from the student protests of the late 1960s and the anti-vietnam war movement and left an indelible mark on west germany with a series of murders , bomb attacks and robberies just a generation after world war two . it is suspected of killing 34 people in west germany between 1972 and 1991 .
t he raf announced it was disbanding in 1998 . t he home-grown , left-wing terrorist organization has been in the news a lot lately .
with some convicted raf terrorists having been released from jail after serving out their sentences - most recently brigitte mohnhaupt - a debate has arisen about whether they still represent a danger to the public , or whether germans should draw a line under this brutal piece of the past . dw spoke to michael buback , the son of former german federal prosecutor , siegfried buback who was murdered in his car by the raf on april 7 , 1977 through shots fired by a person on a passing motorbike .
57-year-old buback 's driver and a guard were also killed in the attack .
the identity of the murderer remains unknown until today .
buback 's assassination sparked a series of murders of high-profile public figures by the raf in the same year which came to be known as the " german autumn . " deutsche welle : there 's been a lot discussion about convicted raf terrorists .
how do you cope with that as a relative of one of the victims ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback , son of murdered federal prosecutor siegfried buback michael buback : my feelings are mixed .
on the one hand , we relatives are happy that we put everything behind us .
it 's something you have to bear yourself .
no one can give you much help .
on the other hand , it 's of course important for us to examine the phenomenon of how such terrible crimes could have ever come about . the discussion that 's flared up shows that this phenomenon has hardly been dealt with in its entirety .
and because it 's important , we have to confront it .
that 's something we relatives have to accept .
of course , it brings back a lot of difficult moments .
i ca n't help thinking back to that day right now .
it 's terrible , but i think we have to confront terrorism .
back then only a few people were affected .
today , we 're all confronted with it .
we have to try to rid the world of this plague .
that demands intense investigation .
it requires us to collect all the known facts .
we have to see what kind of terrible crime these were , and we have to make sure they are never repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former federal prosecutor siegfried buback who was gunned down on april 7 , 1977 do victims ' relatives keep in contact with one another ? we keep in informal contact .
we do n't have organized meetings .
sometimes random groups will get together once every five or ten years .
but we do n't plan anything .
i occasionally get asked whether the interests of the victims and their relatives are taken seriously .
i always say that the victims do n't have any interests any more .
they were killed .
and the relatives do n't have interests in the normal sense .
how could we ?
we 're available for one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt , right , was released from prison last month .

for me it 's not a daily thing , but for my mother it is .
she 's been alone for 30 years .
i have so much to do .
i only feel it really strongly when something pushes me in that direction .
over the decades i 've always tried to relate everything i hear back to those events .
i 'm always trying to learn more and reach new insights .
those who only think about those events on anniversaries never realize that we 're still trying to make a contribution . can people who did n't directly experience this piece of history ever truly understand it ? our children have been informing themselves - especially because of all the public attention .
i think that this is an important area that everyone should be clear about .
i associate the raf with earlier horrors in german history .
we have to investigate the phenomenon that people simply decide to kill other people because they do n't fit into their picture of the world .
one of my father 's predecessors wrote in a eulogy that the raf terrorists were the true heirs to the fascist criminals .
i think there 's truth to that .
both were cold-hearted enough to simply get rid of people .
the scale was of course completely different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf enjoyed support from roughly a quarter of germans in its early years but we should be concerned about the general phenomenon , keep it in our minds and draw our lessons from it .

dw spoke to buback 's son about the event 's legacy . founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the radical left-wing raf rose from the student protests of the late 1960s and the anti-vietnam war movement and left an indelible mark on west germany with a series of murders , bomb attacks and robberies just a generation after world war two . it is suspected of killing 34 people in west germany between 1972 and 1991 .
t he raf announced it was disbanding in 1998 . t he home-grown , left-wing terrorist organization has been in the news a lot lately .
with some convicted raf terrorists having been released from jail after serving out their sentences - most recently brigitte mohnhaupt - a debate has arisen about whether they still represent a danger to the public , or whether germans should draw a line under this brutal piece of the past . dw spoke to michael buback , the son of former german federal prosecutor , siegfried buback who was murdered in his car by the raf on april 7 , 1977 through shots fired by a person on a passing motorbike .
57-year-old buback 's driver and a guard were also killed in the attack .
the identity of the murderer remains unknown until today .
buback 's assassination sparked a series of murders of high-profile public figures by the raf in the same year which came to be known as the " german autumn . " deutsche welle : there 's been a lot discussion about convicted raf terrorists .
how do you cope with that as a relative of one of the victims ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback , son of murdered federal prosecutor siegfried buback michael buback : my feelings are mixed .
on the one hand , we relatives are happy that we put everything behind us .
it 's something you have to bear yourself .
no one can give you much help .
on the other hand , it 's of course important for us to examine the phenomenon of how such terrible crimes could have ever come about . the discussion that 's flared up shows that this phenomenon has hardly been dealt with in its entirety .
and because it 's important , we have to confront it .
that 's something we relatives have to accept .
of course , it brings back a lot of difficult moments .
i ca n't help thinking back to that day right now .
it 's terrible , but i think we have to confront terrorism .
back then only a few people were affected .
today , we 're all confronted with it .
we have to try to rid the world of this plague .
that demands intense investigation .
it requires us to collect all the known facts .
we have to see what kind of terrible crime these were , and we have to make sure they are never repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former federal prosecutor siegfried buback who was gunned down on april 7 , 1977 do victims ' relatives keep in contact with one another ? we keep in informal contact .
we do n't have organized meetings .
sometimes random groups will get together once every five or ten years .
but we do n't plan anything .
i occasionally get asked whether the interests of the victims and their relatives are taken seriously .
i always say that the victims do n't have any interests any more .
they were killed .
and the relatives do n't have interests in the normal sense .
how could we ?
we 're available for one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt , right , was released from prison last month .
christian klar remains behind bars i try to be so as far as possible .
we 've lived with the problem for 30 years .
for me it 's not a daily thing , but for my mother it is .
she 's been alone for 30 years .
i have so much to do .
i only feel it really strongly when something pushes me in that direction .
over the decades i 've always tried to relate everything i hear back to those events .
i 'm always trying to learn more and reach new insights .
those who only think about those events on anniversaries never realize that we 're still trying to make a contribution . can people who did n't directly experience this piece of history ever truly understand it ? our children have been informing themselves - especially because of all the public attention .
i think that this is an important area that everyone should be clear about .
i associate the raf with earlier horrors in german history .
we have to investigate the phenomenon that people simply decide to kill other people because they do n't fit into their picture of the world .
one of my father 's predecessors wrote in a eulogy that the raf terrorists were the true heirs to the fascist criminals .
i think there 's truth to that .
both were cold-hearted enough to simply get rid of people .
the scale was of course completely different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf enjoyed support from roughly a quarter of germans in its early years but we should be concerned about the general phenomenon , keep it in our minds and draw our lessons from it .
it can always be rekindled .
in that respect i 'm very sceptical about the discussion concerning whether to draw a line under the -lrb- raf -rrb- past .
we should never feel too secure .
until we understand that , we should n't be drawing lines under the past . michael buback was interviewed by petra diroll -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former red army faction leader mohnhaupt goes free brigitte mohnhaupt , a former leader of the red army faction group which terrorized germany in the 1970s , left jail sunday after serving 24 years for a series of guerrilla murders .
-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- release of former militant sparks mixed feelings in germany most german political parties consider the release of the one-time terrorist and red army faction leader brigitte mohnhaupt as a sign of justice .

bundesliga leaders schalke 04 welcome bottom club borussia mönchengladbach saturday looking to put last weeks defeat to bayern munich behind them while hoping that their title rivals suffer from a european hangover . schalke are two points clear of werder bremen with seven games remaining and coach mirko slomka admits his side need to start delivering better performances if the club is to win a first national title since 1958 .
" if we are to win the title , we have to improve , " said slomka . slomka 's side will be hoping european competition may have diverted the attention of two of their major challengers for the title .
fourth-placed bayern munich , whose 2-2 draw at ac milan on tuesday has left them with one foot in the champions league semi-finals , visit hanover on saturday while werder bremen , who drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in uefa cup quarter-final , first leg action on thursday , host nuremberg on sunday . schalke have some personnel problems ahead of saturday 's clash with gladbach and slomka must try and fill the void left by the suspension of fabian ernst for his fifth yellow card but , on a more positive note , serb defender mladen krstajic is back following a broken rib . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krstajic 's return will be equally celebrated krstajic has had to wear a special protective suit to help his rib recover but has finally been able to train without it .
" i 'm not scared , " the 32-year-old said on his ditching the protection .
" it 's just a different feeling , that 's all .
i 'm still being a bit careful in the tackle , but things will be very different on saturday .
at least i can breathe properly again . " slomka must also decide whether to field halil altintop .
" halil has been struggling with a groin injury for weeks , " slomka told the club 's website .
" every time he sets off on a sprint he 's in pain .
it 's a very tough and unpleasant situation for him . " what 's important is if he can say to us on friday that the pain has gone .
that was n't the case on tuesday or on wednesday , " said slomka . schalke have 53 points from 27 matches to lead by two points from werder bremen , and by four and six points from vfb stuttgart , who travel to hamburg sv on saturday , and munich respectively . bayern loss still rankles with schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay 's fast goal stunned schalke last week schalke 's 2-0 defeat at bayern on saturday was a major blow to slomka 's men and it still rankles .
" the main thing -lrb- against gladbach -rrb- is not to concede a goal after three minutes , " said krstajic , referring to roy makaay 's goal for bayern . slomka said of the gladbach match : " things always look cut and dried on paper .
we 're top and everyone else is behind us .
so of course we 're favorites when we play the bottom side at home . " gladbach are five points adrift of safety but coach jos luhukay is not overawed by what he describes as a ' david versus goliath ' duel .
" we 'll get a lot of space in schalke and could earn a point there , " he said . schalke and gladbach have won just once in the last seven games each .
but the good news for schalke is that they have not lost at home against their opponents in 11 games , winning seven and drawing four . bremen need to take chances , says klose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose takes his chances but will bremen grabs theirs ?
second-placed bremen failed to take full advantage of schalke 's slip-up against bayern last week - playing out a drab scoreless draw at lowly energie cottbus - and desperately need a win sunday at home to sixth-placed nuremberg . " we 're not going to get many more chances , " said german international miroslav klose . nuremberg will be no easy touch as the southern germans are just one point off the uefa cup spot , currently occupied by fifth-placed bayer leverkusen , who welcome relegation-threatened vfl bochum . third-placed vfb stuttgart visit improving sv hamburg , looking to cement their champions league place . stuttgart , bayern looking to increase pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have left many rivals on the deck this season stuttgart are four points behind schalke , but just two clear of defending champions bayern .
coach armin veh said the club would rate a third-place finish and a place in europe 's top club tournament next season a success . bayern will be without willy sagnol , who is out for the season with a meniscus injury picked up in italy , against hanover .
lucio , hasan salihamidzic and owen hargreaves are also injury concerns . in other matches saturday , eintracht frankfurt welcome energie cottbus , struggling borussia dortmund visit alemannia aachen , sliding hertha berlin take on arminia bielefeld and vfl wolfsburg entertain mainz 05 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leverkusen routed while bremen keep uefa cup dream alive werder bremen could be germany 's last contender in the uefa cup by the end of next week after bayer leverkusen suffered a hugely damaging 3-0 home defeat against osasuna .

a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases . in an interview with german daily die welt , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas urged germany to intensify its commitment towards cutting heat-trapping greenhouse gases and combating global warming . dimas conceded that germany is a world leader when it comes to expanding its power supply sourced from renewable energy .
but he said the country needed to catch up in other areas . dimas : german car industry needs to do more " the european union 's climate goals can only be reached if germany - europe 's biggest economy - plays along , " dimas said , adding that the car industry could definitely do more .
he underlined that the future lay in fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars and not in large fuel-guzzling ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are accused of lagging behind on environmental developments the german car industry - one of the most profitable sectors in the country - has long been under fire for failing to develop green technologies to power vehicles and focusing instead on the bottom line and on producing luxury models . in fact , the industry has been accused of trailing the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said last month . even the german government has controversially resisted pressure from the eu to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
the move was widely seen as an attempt by chancellor angela merkel 's government to protect its car industry after several companies complained of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . german leaders proud of leading role dimas ' comments are however disputed by german leaders who have long prided themselves on germany 's leading role in environmental affairs . sigmar gabriel , germany 's environment minister , on saturday pointed out that the eu had no chance of meeting its climate goals by 2012 without germany 's contribution .
gabriel stressed that his country alone was shouldering three-fourths of the bloc 's ambitious greenhouse cuts . while the eu plans to reduce its co2 emissions by eight percent against 1990 levels , germany has committed itself to cutting its levels by 21 percent , gabriel said . the environment minister also said there was agreement with the german economy ministry to provide incentives for building new power plants outfitted with modern technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still relies heavily on coal-fired power plants " in germany , we will continue to use coal because we ca n't entirely reduce our reliance on it .

" the bald statistics tell us that we -lrb- germans -rrb- have to do much more -lrb- to combat global warming -rrb- , " töpfer said . " most of the reduction of greenhouse gases in germany is due to cleaning up the energy sector in the former east germany and is a consequence of german reunification , " he added .

bundesliga leaders schalke 04 welcome bottom club borussia mönchengladbach saturday looking to put last weeks defeat to bayern munich behind them while hoping that their title rivals suffer from a european hangover . schalke are two points clear of werder bremen with seven games remaining and coach mirko slomka admits his side need to start delivering better performances if the club is to win a first national title since 1958 .
" if we are to win the title , we have to improve , " said slomka . slomka 's side will be hoping european competition may have diverted the attention of two of their major challengers for the title .
fourth-placed bayern munich , whose 2-2 draw at ac milan on tuesday has left them with one foot in the champions league semi-finals , visit hanover on saturday while werder bremen , who drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in uefa cup quarter-final , first leg action on thursday , host nuremberg on sunday . schalke have some personnel problems ahead of saturday 's clash with gladbach and slomka must try and fill the void left by the suspension of fabian ernst for his fifth yellow card but , on a more positive note , serb defender mladen krstajic is back following a broken rib . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krstajic 's return will be equally celebrated krstajic has had to wear a special protective suit to help his rib recover but has finally been able to train without it .
" i 'm not scared , " the 32-year-old said on his ditching the protection .
" it 's just a different feeling , that 's all .
i 'm still being a bit careful in the tackle , but things will be very different on saturday .
at least i can breathe properly again . " slomka must also decide whether to field halil altintop .
" halil has been struggling with a groin injury for weeks , " slomka told the club 's website .
" every time he sets off on a sprint he 's in pain .
it 's a very tough and unpleasant situation for him . " what 's important is if he can say to us on friday that the pain has gone .
that was n't the case on tuesday or on wednesday , " said slomka . schalke have 53 points from 27 matches to lead by two points from werder bremen , and by four and six points from vfb stuttgart , who travel to hamburg sv on saturday , and munich respectively . bayern loss still rankles with schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay 's fast goal stunned schalke last week schalke 's 2-0 defeat at bayern on saturday was a major blow to slomka 's men and it still rankles .
" the main thing -lrb- against gladbach -rrb- is not to concede a goal after three minutes , " said krstajic , referring to roy makaay 's goal for bayern . slomka said of the gladbach match : " things always look cut and dried on paper .
we 're top and everyone else is behind us .
so of course we 're favorites when we play the bottom side at home . " gladbach are five points adrift of safety but coach jos luhukay is not overawed by what he describes as a ' david versus goliath ' duel .
" we 'll get a lot of space in schalke and could earn a point there , " he said . schalke and gladbach have won just once in the last seven games each .
but the good news for schalke is that they have not lost at home against their opponents in 11 games , winning seven and drawing four . bremen need to take chances , says klose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose takes his chances but will bremen grabs theirs ?
second-placed bremen failed to take full advantage of schalke 's slip-up against bayern last week - playing out a drab scoreless draw at lowly energie cottbus - and desperately need a win sunday at home to sixth-placed nuremberg . " we 're not going to get many more chances , " said german international miroslav klose . nuremberg will be no easy touch as the southern germans are just one point off the uefa cup spot , currently occupied by fifth-placed bayer leverkusen , who welcome relegation-threatened vfl bochum . third-placed vfb stuttgart visit improving sv hamburg , looking to cement their champions league place . stuttgart , bayern looking to increase pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have left many rivals on the deck this season stuttgart are four points behind schalke , but just two clear of defending champions bayern .
coach armin veh said the club would rate a third-place finish and a place in europe 's top club tournament next season a success . bayern will be without willy sagnol , who is out for the season with a meniscus injury picked up in italy , against hanover .
lucio , hasan salihamidzic and owen hargreaves are also injury concerns . in other matches saturday , eintracht frankfurt welcome energie cottbus , struggling borussia dortmund visit alemannia aachen , sliding hertha berlin take on arminia bielefeld and vfl wolfsburg entertain mainz 05 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leverkusen routed while bremen keep uefa cup dream alive werder bremen could be germany 's last contender in the uefa cup by the end of next week after bayer leverkusen suffered a hugely damaging 3-0 home defeat against osasuna .

a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases . in an interview with german daily die welt , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas urged germany to intensify its commitment towards cutting heat-trapping greenhouse gases and combating global warming . dimas conceded that germany is a world leader when it comes to expanding its power supply sourced from renewable energy .
but he said the country needed to catch up in other areas . dimas : german car industry needs to do more " the european union 's climate goals can only be reached if germany - europe 's biggest economy - plays along , " dimas said , adding that the car industry could definitely do more .
he underlined that the future lay in fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars and not in large fuel-guzzling ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are accused of lagging behind on environmental developments the german car industry - one of the most profitable sectors in the country - has long been under fire for failing to develop green technologies to power vehicles and focusing instead on the bottom line and on producing luxury models . in fact , the industry has been accused of trailing the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said last month . even the german government has controversially resisted pressure from the eu to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
the move was widely seen as an attempt by chancellor angela merkel 's government to protect its car industry after several companies complained of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . german leaders proud of leading role dimas ' comments are however disputed by german leaders who have long prided themselves on germany 's leading role in environmental affairs . sigmar gabriel , germany 's environment minister , on saturday pointed out that the eu had no chance of meeting its climate goals by 2012 without germany 's contribution .
gabriel stressed that his country alone was shouldering three-fourths of the bloc 's ambitious greenhouse cuts . while the eu plans to reduce its co2 emissions by eight percent against 1990 levels , germany has committed itself to cutting its levels by 21 percent , gabriel said . the environment minister also said there was agreement with the german economy ministry to provide incentives for building new power plants outfitted with modern technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still relies heavily on coal-fired power plants " in germany , we will continue to use coal because we ca n't entirely reduce our reliance on it .
but we wo n't be giving it any special privileges , " gabriel told the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , adding that energy-efficient plants will take precedence instead . coal-fired power plants are one of the biggest producers of greenhouses gases , which scientists have said are primarily responsible for global warming . bleak forecast for world climate on friday , the un published a damning report on climate change , saying that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . german leaders reacted swiftly to the bleak prognosis .
the german government would continue to pioneer climate protection , said chancellor angela merkel , who pledged to raise the issue when she hosts the next g8 summit . on saturday , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee also announced plans to compel carmakers to indicate to potential buyers in a transparent way how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- different models emitted .

the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said last month . even the german government has controversially resisted pressure from the eu to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
the move was widely seen as an attempt by chancellor angela merkel 's government to protect its car industry after several companies complained of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . german leaders proud of leading role dimas ' comments are however disputed by german leaders who have long prided themselves on germany 's leading role in environmental affairs . sigmar gabriel , germany 's environment minister , on saturday pointed out that the eu had no chance of meeting its climate goals by 2012 without germany 's contribution .
gabriel stressed that his country alone was shouldering three-fourths of the bloc 's ambitious greenhouse cuts . while the eu plans to reduce its co2 emissions by eight percent against 1990 levels , germany has committed itself to cutting its levels by 21 percent , gabriel said . the environment minister also said there was agreement with the german economy ministry to provide incentives for building new power plants outfitted with modern technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still relies heavily on coal-fired power plants " in germany , we will continue to use coal because we ca n't entirely reduce our reliance on it .
but we wo n't be giving it any special privileges , " gabriel told the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , adding that energy-efficient plants will take precedence instead . coal-fired power plants are one of the biggest producers of greenhouses gases , which scientists have said are primarily responsible for global warming . bleak forecast for world climate on friday , the un published a damning report on climate change , saying that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . german leaders reacted swiftly to the bleak prognosis .
the german government would continue to pioneer climate protection , said chancellor angela merkel , who pledged to raise the issue when she hosts the next g8 summit . on saturday , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee also announced plans to compel carmakers to indicate to potential buyers in a transparent way how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- different models emitted . " wide gap between german words and actions " but germany 's perceived role as a world leader in green affairs was slammed by the country 's former environment minister and head of the un environment program , klaus töpfer who said there was a wide gap between german words and actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer has lashed out at germany 's green record in an interview with welt am sonntag , töpfer warned that " germans continue to considerably affect the climate , " saying that every german on average created ten tons of carbon dioxide each year . that may make germany 's per person carbon dioxide output only half as high as that of an average american 's but on a worldwide scale germany was in the top group of the world 's worst polluters , töpfer said . the environmental expert said the per-person co2 emissions of the french stood at below seven tons , that of a chinese just about three tons while an indian only about one ton . " the bald statistics tell us that we -lrb- germans -rrb- have to do much more -lrb- to combat global warming -rrb- , " töpfer said . " most of the reduction of greenhouse gases in germany is due to cleaning up the energy sector in the former east germany and is a consequence of german reunification , " he added .
" germany must reduce its emissions to between 60 and 80 percent , " topfer said , for which there is an " urgent need for a revolutionary change in energy consumption , whether in the economic sector or in society .

bundesliga leaders schalke 04 welcome bottom club borussia mönchengladbach saturday looking to put last weeks defeat to bayern munich behind them while hoping that their title rivals suffer from a european hangover . schalke are two points clear of werder bremen with seven games remaining and coach mirko slomka admits his side need to start delivering better performances if the club is to win a first national title since 1958 .
" if we are to win the title , we have to improve , " said slomka . slomka 's side will be hoping european competition may have diverted the attention of two of their major challengers for the title .
fourth-placed bayern munich , whose 2-2 draw at ac milan on tuesday has left them with one foot in the champions league semi-finals , visit hanover on saturday while werder bremen , who drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in uefa cup quarter-final , first leg action on thursday , host nuremberg on sunday . schalke have some personnel problems ahead of saturday 's clash with gladbach and slomka must try and fill the void left by the suspension of fabian ernst for his fifth yellow card but , on a more positive note , serb defender mladen krstajic is back following a broken rib . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krstajic 's return will be equally celebrated krstajic has had to wear a special protective suit to help his rib recover but has finally been able to train without it .
" i 'm not scared , " the 32-year-old said on his ditching the protection .
" it 's just a different feeling , that 's all .
i 'm still being a bit careful in the tackle , but things will be very different on saturday .
at least i can breathe properly again . " slomka must also decide whether to field halil altintop .
" halil has been struggling with a groin injury for weeks , " slomka told the club 's website .
" every time he sets off on a sprint he 's in pain .
it 's a very tough and unpleasant situation for him . " what 's important is if he can say to us on friday that the pain has gone .
that was n't the case on tuesday or on wednesday , " said slomka . schalke have 53 points from 27 matches to lead by two points from werder bremen , and by four and six points from vfb stuttgart , who travel to hamburg sv on saturday , and munich respectively . bayern loss still rankles with schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay 's fast goal stunned schalke last week schalke 's 2-0 defeat at bayern on saturday was a major blow to slomka 's men and it still rankles .
" the main thing -lrb- against gladbach -rrb- is not to concede a goal after three minutes , " said krstajic , referring to roy makaay 's goal for bayern . slomka said of the gladbach match : " things always look cut and dried on paper .
we 're top and everyone else is behind us .
so of course we 're favorites when we play the bottom side at home . " gladbach are five points adrift of safety but coach jos luhukay is not overawed by what he describes as a ' david versus goliath ' duel .
" we 'll get a lot of space in schalke and could earn a point there , " he said . schalke and gladbach have won just once in the last seven games each .
but the good news for schalke is that they have not lost at home against their opponents in 11 games , winning seven and drawing four . bremen need to take chances , says klose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose takes his chances but will bremen grabs theirs ?
second-placed bremen failed to take full advantage of schalke 's slip-up against bayern last week - playing out a drab scoreless draw at lowly energie cottbus - and desperately need a win sunday at home to sixth-placed nuremberg . " we 're not going to get many more chances , " said german international miroslav klose . nuremberg will be no easy touch as the southern germans are just one point off the uefa cup spot , currently occupied by fifth-placed bayer leverkusen , who welcome relegation-threatened vfl bochum . third-placed vfb stuttgart visit improving sv hamburg , looking to cement their champions league place . stuttgart , bayern looking to increase pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have left many rivals on the deck this season stuttgart are four points behind schalke , but just two clear of defending champions bayern .
coach armin veh said the club would rate a third-place finish and a place in europe 's top club tournament next season a success . bayern will be without willy sagnol , who is out for the season with a meniscus injury picked up in italy , against hanover .
lucio , hasan salihamidzic and owen hargreaves are also injury concerns . in other matches saturday , eintracht frankfurt welcome energie cottbus , struggling borussia dortmund visit alemannia aachen , sliding hertha berlin take on arminia bielefeld and vfl wolfsburg entertain mainz 05 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leverkusen routed while bremen keep uefa cup dream alive werder bremen could be germany 's last contender in the uefa cup by the end of next week after bayer leverkusen suffered a hugely damaging 3-0 home defeat against osasuna .

a pilot plant went into operation in the eastern town of jänschwalde thursday . vattenfall claims the carbon-capture plant is the first step towards co2-emission-free power generation based on coal .
the swedish-owned company built the pilot project in eastern germany where lignite mining and burning is the primary source of energy production . the jänschwalde power plant is a 1600-megawatt energy giant gobbling up more than 80 thousand tons of lignite every day .
located in the middle of the vast and barren coal fields of the eastern german state of brandenburg , it spews 25 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air - making it germany 's largest single emitter of the greenhouse gases , which are blamed for global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , a co2 sinner as of thursday , however , the technology of the last century exists side by side with that of a new era of energy production .
vattenfall europe has begun testing a plant that will capture the co2 emissions and pump them into deep rock . klaus rauscher , a member of the board of the swedish-owned company , says the technology is intended to make coal-fired power generation cleaner until alternative energy sources will be ready for commercial use . " we are sitting on enough lignite here that will last us for the next 30 to 40 years , " he said .
" but it ’ s acceptable to use this resource only if we get a grip on the huge greenhouse gas emissions .
our pilot plant is capable of resolving this problem . " burying the emissions vattenfall has spent 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- on the new plant , which produces about 50 megawatts of electricity .
the plant uses a technology called oxyfuel combustion which burns lignite in pure oxygen rather than air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are we heading - fossil fuels or renewables ?
this produces only carbon dioxide and water vapour so that emissions can easily be liquified and pumped underground .
it is said to be the most cost-effective method of capturing carbon dioxide . " for us researchers it ’ s like entering uncharted territory with only our pioneering spirit to help us along , " said hans joachim krautz , who along with his research team at cottbus technical university in brandenburg , developed the process . vattenfall has yet to find proper storage facilities for the captured co2 , but claims that this should not be a problem as exhausted natural gas deposits , for example , are well suited for that . long-term solution ? critics of the technology say dumping greenhouse gases underground is not the long-term answer , and reducing emissions must take priority . but even environmentalists say that there may be little other choice for the time being . " we will continue to need fossil fuels for a while but have to make their use more climate friendly , " said manfred fischdick , vice-president of the wuppertal climate institute .
" carbon capture is one way of doing that . " if the trial runs at the jänschwalde pilot plant turn out to be successful , vattenfall plans to set up a bigger , 300 megawatt project by 2015 .
the first commercial co2-emission-free lignite plant , the company says , is then likely to go into operation by 2020 . hardy graupner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says report underscores need to limit global warming a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .

a pilot plant went into operation in the eastern town of jänschwalde thursday . vattenfall claims the carbon-capture plant is the first step towards co2-emission-free power generation based on coal .
the swedish-owned company built the pilot project in eastern germany where lignite mining and burning is the primary source of energy production . the jänschwalde power plant is a 1600-megawatt energy giant gobbling up more than 80 thousand tons of lignite every day .
located in the middle of the vast and barren coal fields of the eastern german state of brandenburg , it spews 25 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air - making it germany 's largest single emitter of the greenhouse gases , which are blamed for global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , a co2 sinner as of thursday , however , the technology of the last century exists side by side with that of a new era of energy production .
vattenfall europe has begun testing a plant that will capture the co2 emissions and pump them into deep rock . klaus rauscher , a member of the board of the swedish-owned company , says the technology is intended to make coal-fired power generation cleaner until alternative energy sources will be ready for commercial use . " we are sitting on enough lignite here that will last us for the next 30 to 40 years , " he said .
" but it ’ s acceptable to use this resource only if we get a grip on the huge greenhouse gas emissions .
our pilot plant is capable of resolving this problem . " burying the emissions vattenfall has spent 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- on the new plant , which produces about 50 megawatts of electricity .
the plant uses a technology called oxyfuel combustion which burns lignite in pure oxygen rather than air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are we heading - fossil fuels or renewables ?
this produces only carbon dioxide and water vapour so that emissions can easily be liquified and pumped underground .
it is said to be the most cost-effective method of capturing carbon dioxide . " for us researchers it ’ s like entering uncharted territory with only our pioneering spirit to help us along , " said hans joachim krautz , who along with his research team at cottbus technical university in brandenburg , developed the process . vattenfall has yet to find proper storage facilities for the captured co2 , but claims that this should not be a problem as exhausted natural gas deposits , for example , are well suited for that . long-term solution ? critics of the technology say dumping greenhouse gases underground is not the long-term answer , and reducing emissions must take priority . but even environmentalists say that there may be little other choice for the time being . " we will continue to need fossil fuels for a while but have to make their use more climate friendly , " said manfred fischdick , vice-president of the wuppertal climate institute .
" carbon capture is one way of doing that . " if the trial runs at the jänschwalde pilot plant turn out to be successful , vattenfall plans to set up a bigger , 300 megawatt project by 2015 .

a pilot plant went into operation in the eastern town of jänschwalde thursday . vattenfall claims the carbon-capture plant is the first step towards co2-emission-free power generation based on coal .
the swedish-owned company built the pilot project in eastern germany where lignite mining and burning is the primary source of energy production . the jänschwalde power plant is a 1600-megawatt energy giant gobbling up more than 80 thousand tons of lignite every day .
located in the middle of the vast and barren coal fields of the eastern german state of brandenburg , it spews 25 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air - making it germany 's largest single emitter of the greenhouse gases , which are blamed for global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , a co2 sinner as of thursday , however , the technology of the last century exists side by side with that of a new era of energy production .
vattenfall europe has begun testing a plant that will capture the co2 emissions and pump them into deep rock . klaus rauscher , a member of the board of the swedish-owned company , says the technology is intended to make coal-fired power generation cleaner until alternative energy sources will be ready for commercial use . " we are sitting on enough lignite here that will last us for the next 30 to 40 years , " he said .
" but it ’ s acceptable to use this resource only if we get a grip on the huge greenhouse gas emissions .
our pilot plant is capable of resolving this problem . " burying the emissions vattenfall has spent 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- on the new plant , which produces about 50 megawatts of electricity .
the plant uses a technology called oxyfuel combustion which burns lignite in pure oxygen rather than air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are we heading - fossil fuels or renewables ?
this produces only carbon dioxide and water vapour so that emissions can easily be liquified and pumped underground .
it is said to be the most cost-effective method of capturing carbon dioxide . " for us researchers it ’ s like entering uncharted territory with only our pioneering spirit to help us along , " said hans joachim krautz , who along with his research team at cottbus technical university in brandenburg , developed the process . vattenfall has yet to find proper storage facilities for the captured co2 , but claims that this should not be a problem as exhausted natural gas deposits , for example , are well suited for that . long-term solution ? critics of the technology say dumping greenhouse gases underground is not the long-term answer , and reducing emissions must take priority . but even environmentalists say that there may be little other choice for the time being . " we will continue to need fossil fuels for a while but have to make their use more climate friendly , " said manfred fischdick , vice-president of the wuppertal climate institute .
" carbon capture is one way of doing that . " if the trial runs at the jänschwalde pilot plant turn out to be successful , vattenfall plans to set up a bigger , 300 megawatt project by 2015 .
the first commercial co2-emission-free lignite plant , the company says , is then likely to go into operation by 2020 . hardy graupner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says report underscores need to limit global warming a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .

bundesliga leaders schalke 04 welcome bottom club borussia mönchengladbach saturday looking to put last weeks defeat to bayern munich behind them while hoping that their title rivals suffer from a european hangover . schalke are two points clear of werder bremen with seven games remaining and coach mirko slomka admits his side need to start delivering better performances if the club is to win a first national title since 1958 .
" if we are to win the title , we have to improve , " said slomka . slomka 's side will be hoping european competition may have diverted the attention of two of their major challengers for the title .
fourth-placed bayern munich , whose 2-2 draw at ac milan on tuesday has left them with one foot in the champions league semi-finals , visit hanover on saturday while werder bremen , who drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in uefa cup quarter-final , first leg action on thursday , host nuremberg on sunday . schalke have some personnel problems ahead of saturday 's clash with gladbach and slomka must try and fill the void left by the suspension of fabian ernst for his fifth yellow card but , on a more positive note , serb defender mladen krstajic is back following a broken rib . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krstajic 's return will be equally celebrated krstajic has had to wear a special protective suit to help his rib recover but has finally been able to train without it .
" i 'm not scared , " the 32-year-old said on his ditching the protection .
" it 's just a different feeling , that 's all .
i 'm still being a bit careful in the tackle , but things will be very different on saturday .
at least i can breathe properly again . " slomka must also decide whether to field halil altintop .
" halil has been struggling with a groin injury for weeks , " slomka told the club 's website .
" every time he sets off on a sprint he 's in pain .
it 's a very tough and unpleasant situation for him . " what 's important is if he can say to us on friday that the pain has gone .
that was n't the case on tuesday or on wednesday , " said slomka . schalke have 53 points from 27 matches to lead by two points from werder bremen , and by four and six points from vfb stuttgart , who travel to hamburg sv on saturday , and munich respectively . bayern loss still rankles with schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay 's fast goal stunned schalke last week schalke 's 2-0 defeat at bayern on saturday was a major blow to slomka 's men and it still rankles .
" the main thing -lrb- against gladbach -rrb- is not to concede a goal after three minutes , " said krstajic , referring to roy makaay 's goal for bayern . slomka said of the gladbach match : " things always look cut and dried on paper .
we 're top and everyone else is behind us .
so of course we 're favorites when we play the bottom side at home . " gladbach are five points adrift of safety but coach jos luhukay is not overawed by what he describes as a ' david versus goliath ' duel .
" we 'll get a lot of space in schalke and could earn a point there , " he said . schalke and gladbach have won just once in the last seven games each .
but the good news for schalke is that they have not lost at home against their opponents in 11 games , winning seven and drawing four . bremen need to take chances , says klose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose takes his chances but will bremen grabs theirs ?
second-placed bremen failed to take full advantage of schalke 's slip-up against bayern last week - playing out a drab scoreless draw at lowly energie cottbus - and desperately need a win sunday at home to sixth-placed nuremberg . " we 're not going to get many more chances , " said german international miroslav klose . nuremberg will be no easy touch as the southern germans are just one point off the uefa cup spot , currently occupied by fifth-placed bayer leverkusen , who welcome relegation-threatened vfl bochum . third-placed vfb stuttgart visit improving sv hamburg , looking to cement their champions league place . stuttgart , bayern looking to increase pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have left many rivals on the deck this season stuttgart are four points behind schalke , but just two clear of defending champions bayern .
coach armin veh said the club would rate a third-place finish and a place in europe 's top club tournament next season a success . bayern will be without willy sagnol , who is out for the season with a meniscus injury picked up in italy , against hanover .
lucio , hasan salihamidzic and owen hargreaves are also injury concerns . in other matches saturday , eintracht frankfurt welcome energie cottbus , struggling borussia dortmund visit alemannia aachen , sliding hertha berlin take on arminia bielefeld and vfl wolfsburg entertain mainz 05 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leverkusen routed while bremen keep uefa cup dream alive werder bremen could be germany 's last contender in the uefa cup by the end of next week after bayer leverkusen suffered a hugely damaging 3-0 home defeat against osasuna .

" but it ’ s acceptable to use this resource only if we get a grip on the huge greenhouse gas emissions .
our pilot plant is capable of resolving this problem . " burying the emissions vattenfall has spent 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- on the new plant , which produces about 50 megawatts of electricity .
the plant uses a technology called oxyfuel combustion which burns lignite in pure oxygen rather than air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are we heading - fossil fuels or renewables ?
this produces only carbon dioxide and water vapour so that emissions can easily be liquified and pumped underground .
it is said to be the most cost-effective method of capturing carbon dioxide . " for us researchers it ’ s like entering uncharted territory with only our pioneering spirit to help us along , " said hans joachim krautz , who along with his research team at cottbus technical university in brandenburg , developed the process . vattenfall has yet to find proper storage facilities for the captured co2 , but claims that this should not be a problem as exhausted natural gas deposits , for example , are well suited for that . long-term solution ? critics of the technology say dumping greenhouse gases underground is not the long-term answer , and reducing emissions must take priority . but even environmentalists say that there may be little other choice for the time being . " we will continue to need fossil fuels for a while but have to make their use more climate friendly , " said manfred fischdick , vice-president of the wuppertal climate institute .
" carbon capture is one way of doing that . " if the trial runs at the jänschwalde pilot plant turn out to be successful , vattenfall plans to set up a bigger , 300 megawatt project by 2015 .
the first commercial co2-emission-free lignite plant , the company says , is then likely to go into operation by 2020 . hardy graupner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says report underscores need to limit global warming a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.04.2007 eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans pride themselves on being environmentally-friendly but are they really ?
a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases . in an interview with german daily die welt , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas urged germany to intensify its commitment towards cutting heat-trapping greenhouse gases and combating global warming . dimas conceded that germany is a world leader when it comes to expanding its power supply sourced from renewable energy .
but he said the country needed to catch up in other areas . dimas : german car industry needs to do more " the european union 's climate goals can only be reached if germany - europe 's biggest economy - plays along , " dimas said , adding that the car industry could definitely do more .
he underlined that the future lay in fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars and not in large fuel-guzzling ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are accused of lagging behind on environmental developments the german car industry - one of the most profitable sectors in the country - has long been under fire for failing to develop green technologies to power vehicles and focusing instead on the bottom line and on producing luxury models . in fact , the industry has been accused of trailing the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said last month . even the german government has controversially resisted pressure from the eu to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
the move was widely seen as an attempt by chancellor angela merkel 's government to protect its car industry after several companies complained of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . german leaders proud of leading role dimas ' comments are however disputed by german leaders who have long prided themselves on germany 's leading role in environmental affairs . sigmar gabriel , germany 's environment minister , on saturday pointed out that the eu had no chance of meeting its climate goals by 2012 without germany 's contribution .
gabriel stressed that his country alone was shouldering three-fourths of the bloc 's ambitious greenhouse cuts . while the eu plans to reduce its co2 emissions by eight percent against 1990 levels , germany has committed itself to cutting its levels by 21 percent , gabriel said . the environment minister also said there was agreement with the german economy ministry to provide incentives for building new power plants outfitted with modern technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still relies heavily on coal-fired power plants " in germany , we will continue to use coal because we ca n't entirely reduce our reliance on it .
but we wo n't be giving it any special privileges , " gabriel told the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , adding that energy-efficient plants will take precedence instead . coal-fired power plants are one of the biggest producers of greenhouses gases , which scientists have said are primarily responsible for global warming . bleak forecast for world climate on friday , the un published a damning report on climate change , saying that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . german leaders reacted swiftly to the bleak prognosis .
the german government would continue to pioneer climate protection , said chancellor angela merkel , who pledged to raise the issue when she hosts the next g8 summit . on saturday , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee also announced plans to compel carmakers to indicate to potential buyers in a transparent way how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- different models emitted . " wide gap between german words and actions " but germany 's perceived role as a world leader in green affairs was slammed by the country 's former environment minister and head of the un environment program , klaus töpfer who said there was a wide gap between german words and actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer has lashed out at germany 's green record in an interview with welt am sonntag , töpfer warned that " germans continue to considerably affect the climate , " saying that every german on average created ten tons of carbon dioxide each year . that may make germany 's per person carbon dioxide output only half as high as that of an average american 's but on a worldwide scale germany was in the top group of the world 's worst polluters , töpfer said . the environmental expert said the per-person co2 emissions of the french stood at below seven tons , that of a chinese just about three tons while an indian only about one ton . " the bald statistics tell us that we -lrb- germans -rrb- have to do much more -lrb- to combat global warming -rrb- , " töpfer said . " most of the reduction of greenhouse gases in germany is due to cleaning up the energy sector in the former east germany and is a consequence of german reunification , " he added .
" germany must reduce its emissions to between 60 and 80 percent , " topfer said , for which there is an " urgent need for a revolutionary change in energy consumption , whether in the economic sector or in society . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says report underscores need to limit global warming a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .

even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering .

in their first public statement since their release , the sailors friday told how they were stripped , blindfolded and handcuffed as part of " psychological " intimidation during their detention . royal marine joe tindell , 21 , told how , blindfolded and their hands bound , the group at one point thought they were about to be executed and that he believed one had had his throat cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british sailors with iranian president ahmadinejad in teheran after their release the eight royal navy sailors and seven royal marines were seized as they carried out what they said were routine anti-smuggling operations near the shatt al-arab waterway that divides iraq and iran on march 23 .
tehran alleged they had entered iranian waters . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday he was releasing the 15 as a " gift " to the british people .
they returned to britain on thursday and have since been debriefed and medically assessed . iran wants " positive " response from britain as the 14 men and one woman began two weeks ' compassionate leave with their families , tehran 's ambassador to london said in an interview published saturday that britain should respond in kind to his country 's actions . rasoul movahedian told the financial times that tehran wanted london 's help in releasing five iranians held in iraq by us forces and on easing international fears about its controversial nuclear program . " we played our part and we showed our good will , " he told the business daily .
" now it is up to the british government to proceed in a positive way . " he denied ahmadinejad 's announcement was linked to the case of the iranians detained in iraq or the release monday in baghdad of an iranian diplomat kidnapped at gunpoint in iraq in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain insists its sailors were n't in iranian waters british prime minister tony blair has also insisted there were no " side " deals done to secure the 15 's release but said the behind-the-scenes diplomatic negotiations had created new lines of communication between britain and iran . movahedian said iran wanted to capitalize on this new dialogue .
" if they -lrb- the british -rrb- want to be helpful and use their influence we will welcome that .
we will welcome in general any steps that could defuse tensions in the region , " he added . sailors speak of intimidation , pressure in iran meanwhile , a british naval inquiry has been set up to establish how the 15 naval personnel came to be detained .
the sailors ' accounts of psychological and emotional torture dominated saturday 's press and media . " we had a blindfold and plastic cuffs , hands behind our backs , heads against the wall .
basically there were weapons cocking , " tindell told bbc news 24 television . " someone , i 'm not sure who , someone said , i quote , ' lads , lads , i think we 're going to get executed ' .

a pilot plant went into operation in the eastern town of jänschwalde thursday . vattenfall claims the carbon-capture plant is the first step towards co2-emission-free power generation based on coal .
the swedish-owned company built the pilot project in eastern germany where lignite mining and burning is the primary source of energy production . the jänschwalde power plant is a 1600-megawatt energy giant gobbling up more than 80 thousand tons of lignite every day .
located in the middle of the vast and barren coal fields of the eastern german state of brandenburg , it spews 25 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air - making it germany 's largest single emitter of the greenhouse gases , which are blamed for global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , a co2 sinner as of thursday , however , the technology of the last century exists side by side with that of a new era of energy production .
vattenfall europe has begun testing a plant that will capture the co2 emissions and pump them into deep rock . klaus rauscher , a member of the board of the swedish-owned company , says the technology is intended to make coal-fired power generation cleaner until alternative energy sources will be ready for commercial use . " we are sitting on enough lignite here that will last us for the next 30 to 40 years , " he said .
" but it ’ s acceptable to use this resource only if we get a grip on the huge greenhouse gas emissions .
our pilot plant is capable of resolving this problem . " burying the emissions vattenfall has spent 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- on the new plant , which produces about 50 megawatts of electricity .
the plant uses a technology called oxyfuel combustion which burns lignite in pure oxygen rather than air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are we heading - fossil fuels or renewables ?
this produces only carbon dioxide and water vapour so that emissions can easily be liquified and pumped underground .
it is said to be the most cost-effective method of capturing carbon dioxide . " for us researchers it ’ s like entering uncharted territory with only our pioneering spirit to help us along , " said hans joachim krautz , who along with his research team at cottbus technical university in brandenburg , developed the process . vattenfall has yet to find proper storage facilities for the captured co2 , but claims that this should not be a problem as exhausted natural gas deposits , for example , are well suited for that . long-term solution ? critics of the technology say dumping greenhouse gases underground is not the long-term answer , and reducing emissions must take priority . but even environmentalists say that there may be little other choice for the time being . " we will continue to need fossil fuels for a while but have to make their use more climate friendly , " said manfred fischdick , vice-president of the wuppertal climate institute .
" carbon capture is one way of doing that . " if the trial runs at the jänschwalde pilot plant turn out to be successful , vattenfall plans to set up a bigger , 300 megawatt project by 2015 .
the first commercial co2-emission-free lignite plant , the company says , is then likely to go into operation by 2020 . hardy graupner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says report underscores need to limit global warming a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .

dw spoke to buback 's son about the event 's legacy . founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the radical left-wing raf rose from the student protests of the late 1960s and the anti-vietnam war movement and left an indelible mark on west germany with a series of murders , bomb attacks and robberies just a generation after world war two . it is suspected of killing 34 people in west germany between 1972 and 1991 .
t he raf announced it was disbanding in 1998 . t he home-grown , left-wing terrorist organization has been in the news a lot lately .
with some convicted raf terrorists having been released from jail after serving out their sentences - most recently brigitte mohnhaupt - a debate has arisen about whether they still represent a danger to the public , or whether germans should draw a line under this brutal piece of the past . dw spoke to michael buback , the son of former german federal prosecutor , siegfried buback who was murdered in his car by the raf on april 7 , 1977 through shots fired by a person on a passing motorbike .
57-year-old buback 's driver and a guard were also killed in the attack .
the identity of the murderer remains unknown until today .
buback 's assassination sparked a series of murders of high-profile public figures by the raf in the same year which came to be known as the " german autumn . " deutsche welle : there 's been a lot discussion about convicted raf terrorists .
how do you cope with that as a relative of one of the victims ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback , son of murdered federal prosecutor siegfried buback michael buback : my feelings are mixed .
on the one hand , we relatives are happy that we put everything behind us .
it 's something you have to bear yourself .
no one can give you much help .
on the other hand , it 's of course important for us to examine the phenomenon of how such terrible crimes could have ever come about . the discussion that 's flared up shows that this phenomenon has hardly been dealt with in its entirety .
and because it 's important , we have to confront it .
that 's something we relatives have to accept .
of course , it brings back a lot of difficult moments .
i ca n't help thinking back to that day right now .
it 's terrible , but i think we have to confront terrorism .
back then only a few people were affected .
today , we 're all confronted with it .
we have to try to rid the world of this plague .
that demands intense investigation .
it requires us to collect all the known facts .
we have to see what kind of terrible crime these were , and we have to make sure they are never repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former federal prosecutor siegfried buback who was gunned down on april 7 , 1977 do victims ' relatives keep in contact with one another ? we keep in informal contact .
we do n't have organized meetings .
sometimes random groups will get together once every five or ten years .
but we do n't plan anything .
i occasionally get asked whether the interests of the victims and their relatives are taken seriously .
i always say that the victims do n't have any interests any more .
they were killed .
and the relatives do n't have interests in the normal sense .
how could we ?

for me it 's not a daily thing , but for my mother it is .
she 's been alone for 30 years .
i have so much to do .
i only feel it really strongly when something pushes me in that direction .
over the decades i 've always tried to relate everything i hear back to those events .
i 'm always trying to learn more and reach new insights .
those who only think about those events on anniversaries never realize that we 're still trying to make a contribution . can people who did n't directly experience this piece of history ever truly understand it ? our children have been informing themselves - especially because of all the public attention .
i think that this is an important area that everyone should be clear about .
i associate the raf with earlier horrors in german history .
we have to investigate the phenomenon that people simply decide to kill other people because they do n't fit into their picture of the world .
one of my father 's predecessors wrote in a eulogy that the raf terrorists were the true heirs to the fascist criminals .
i think there 's truth to that .
both were cold-hearted enough to simply get rid of people .
the scale was of course completely different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf enjoyed support from roughly a quarter of germans in its early years but we should be concerned about the general phenomenon , keep it in our minds and draw our lessons from it .
it can always be rekindled .
in that respect i 'm very sceptical about the discussion concerning whether to draw a line under the -lrb- raf -rrb- past .

dw spoke to buback 's son about the event 's legacy . founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the radical left-wing raf rose from the student protests of the late 1960s and the anti-vietnam war movement and left an indelible mark on west germany with a series of murders , bomb attacks and robberies just a generation after world war two . it is suspected of killing 34 people in west germany between 1972 and 1991 .
t he raf announced it was disbanding in 1998 . t he home-grown , left-wing terrorist organization has been in the news a lot lately .
with some convicted raf terrorists having been released from jail after serving out their sentences - most recently brigitte mohnhaupt - a debate has arisen about whether they still represent a danger to the public , or whether germans should draw a line under this brutal piece of the past . dw spoke to michael buback , the son of former german federal prosecutor , siegfried buback who was murdered in his car by the raf on april 7 , 1977 through shots fired by a person on a passing motorbike .
57-year-old buback 's driver and a guard were also killed in the attack .
the identity of the murderer remains unknown until today .
buback 's assassination sparked a series of murders of high-profile public figures by the raf in the same year which came to be known as the " german autumn . " deutsche welle : there 's been a lot discussion about convicted raf terrorists .
how do you cope with that as a relative of one of the victims ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback , son of murdered federal prosecutor siegfried buback michael buback : my feelings are mixed .
on the one hand , we relatives are happy that we put everything behind us .
it 's something you have to bear yourself .
no one can give you much help .
on the other hand , it 's of course important for us to examine the phenomenon of how such terrible crimes could have ever come about . the discussion that 's flared up shows that this phenomenon has hardly been dealt with in its entirety .
and because it 's important , we have to confront it .
that 's something we relatives have to accept .
of course , it brings back a lot of difficult moments .
i ca n't help thinking back to that day right now .
it 's terrible , but i think we have to confront terrorism .
back then only a few people were affected .
today , we 're all confronted with it .
we have to try to rid the world of this plague .
that demands intense investigation .
it requires us to collect all the known facts .
we have to see what kind of terrible crime these were , and we have to make sure they are never repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former federal prosecutor siegfried buback who was gunned down on april 7 , 1977 do victims ' relatives keep in contact with one another ? we keep in informal contact .
we do n't have organized meetings .
sometimes random groups will get together once every five or ten years .
but we do n't plan anything .
i occasionally get asked whether the interests of the victims and their relatives are taken seriously .
i always say that the victims do n't have any interests any more .
they were killed .
and the relatives do n't have interests in the normal sense .
how could we ?
we 're available for one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt , right , was released from prison last month .

for me it 's not a daily thing , but for my mother it is .
she 's been alone for 30 years .
i have so much to do .
i only feel it really strongly when something pushes me in that direction .

i think that this is an important area that everyone should be clear about .
i associate the raf with earlier horrors in german history .
we have to investigate the phenomenon that people simply decide to kill other people because they do n't fit into their picture of the world .

bundesliga leaders schalke 04 welcome bottom club borussia mönchengladbach saturday looking to put last weeks defeat to bayern munich behind them while hoping that their title rivals suffer from a european hangover . schalke are two points clear of werder bremen with seven games remaining and coach mirko slomka admits his side need to start delivering better performances if the club is to win a first national title since 1958 .
" if we are to win the title , we have to improve , " said slomka . slomka 's side will be hoping european competition may have diverted the attention of two of their major challengers for the title .
fourth-placed bayern munich , whose 2-2 draw at ac milan on tuesday has left them with one foot in the champions league semi-finals , visit hanover on saturday while werder bremen , who drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in uefa cup quarter-final , first leg action on thursday , host nuremberg on sunday . schalke have some personnel problems ahead of saturday 's clash with gladbach and slomka must try and fill the void left by the suspension of fabian ernst for his fifth yellow card but , on a more positive note , serb defender mladen krstajic is back following a broken rib . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krstajic 's return will be equally celebrated krstajic has had to wear a special protective suit to help his rib recover but has finally been able to train without it .
" i 'm not scared , " the 32-year-old said on his ditching the protection .
" it 's just a different feeling , that 's all .
i 'm still being a bit careful in the tackle , but things will be very different on saturday .
at least i can breathe properly again . " slomka must also decide whether to field halil altintop .
" halil has been struggling with a groin injury for weeks , " slomka told the club 's website .
" every time he sets off on a sprint he 's in pain .
it 's a very tough and unpleasant situation for him . " what 's important is if he can say to us on friday that the pain has gone .
that was n't the case on tuesday or on wednesday , " said slomka . schalke have 53 points from 27 matches to lead by two points from werder bremen , and by four and six points from vfb stuttgart , who travel to hamburg sv on saturday , and munich respectively . bayern loss still rankles with schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay 's fast goal stunned schalke last week schalke 's 2-0 defeat at bayern on saturday was a major blow to slomka 's men and it still rankles .
" the main thing -lrb- against gladbach -rrb- is not to concede a goal after three minutes , " said krstajic , referring to roy makaay 's goal for bayern . slomka said of the gladbach match : " things always look cut and dried on paper .
we 're top and everyone else is behind us .
so of course we 're favorites when we play the bottom side at home . " gladbach are five points adrift of safety but coach jos luhukay is not overawed by what he describes as a ' david versus goliath ' duel .
" we 'll get a lot of space in schalke and could earn a point there , " he said . schalke and gladbach have won just once in the last seven games each .
but the good news for schalke is that they have not lost at home against their opponents in 11 games , winning seven and drawing four . bremen need to take chances , says klose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose takes his chances but will bremen grabs theirs ?
second-placed bremen failed to take full advantage of schalke 's slip-up against bayern last week - playing out a drab scoreless draw at lowly energie cottbus - and desperately need a win sunday at home to sixth-placed nuremberg . " we 're not going to get many more chances , " said german international miroslav klose . nuremberg will be no easy touch as the southern germans are just one point off the uefa cup spot , currently occupied by fifth-placed bayer leverkusen , who welcome relegation-threatened vfl bochum . third-placed vfb stuttgart visit improving sv hamburg , looking to cement their champions league place . stuttgart , bayern looking to increase pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have left many rivals on the deck this season stuttgart are four points behind schalke , but just two clear of defending champions bayern .
coach armin veh said the club would rate a third-place finish and a place in europe 's top club tournament next season a success . bayern will be without willy sagnol , who is out for the season with a meniscus injury picked up in italy , against hanover .
lucio , hasan salihamidzic and owen hargreaves are also injury concerns . in other matches saturday , eintracht frankfurt welcome energie cottbus , struggling borussia dortmund visit alemannia aachen , sliding hertha berlin take on arminia bielefeld and vfl wolfsburg entertain mainz 05 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leverkusen routed while bremen keep uefa cup dream alive werder bremen could be germany 's last contender in the uefa cup by the end of next week after bayer leverkusen suffered a hugely damaging 3-0 home defeat against osasuna .

a pilot plant went into operation in the eastern town of jänschwalde thursday . vattenfall claims the carbon-capture plant is the first step towards co2-emission-free power generation based on coal .
the swedish-owned company built the pilot project in eastern germany where lignite mining and burning is the primary source of energy production . the jänschwalde power plant is a 1600-megawatt energy giant gobbling up more than 80 thousand tons of lignite every day .
located in the middle of the vast and barren coal fields of the eastern german state of brandenburg , it spews 25 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air - making it germany 's largest single emitter of the greenhouse gases , which are blamed for global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , a co2 sinner as of thursday , however , the technology of the last century exists side by side with that of a new era of energy production .
vattenfall europe has begun testing a plant that will capture the co2 emissions and pump them into deep rock . klaus rauscher , a member of the board of the swedish-owned company , says the technology is intended to make coal-fired power generation cleaner until alternative energy sources will be ready for commercial use . " we are sitting on enough lignite here that will last us for the next 30 to 40 years , " he said .
" but it ’ s acceptable to use this resource only if we get a grip on the huge greenhouse gas emissions .
our pilot plant is capable of resolving this problem . " burying the emissions vattenfall has spent 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- on the new plant , which produces about 50 megawatts of electricity .
the plant uses a technology called oxyfuel combustion which burns lignite in pure oxygen rather than air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are we heading - fossil fuels or renewables ?
this produces only carbon dioxide and water vapour so that emissions can easily be liquified and pumped underground .
it is said to be the most cost-effective method of capturing carbon dioxide . " for us researchers it ’ s like entering uncharted territory with only our pioneering spirit to help us along , " said hans joachim krautz , who along with his research team at cottbus technical university in brandenburg , developed the process . vattenfall has yet to find proper storage facilities for the captured co2 , but claims that this should not be a problem as exhausted natural gas deposits , for example , are well suited for that . long-term solution ? critics of the technology say dumping greenhouse gases underground is not the long-term answer , and reducing emissions must take priority . but even environmentalists say that there may be little other choice for the time being . " we will continue to need fossil fuels for a while but have to make their use more climate friendly , " said manfred fischdick , vice-president of the wuppertal climate institute .
" carbon capture is one way of doing that . " if the trial runs at the jänschwalde pilot plant turn out to be successful , vattenfall plans to set up a bigger , 300 megawatt project by 2015 .
the first commercial co2-emission-free lignite plant , the company says , is then likely to go into operation by 2020 . hardy graupner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says report underscores need to limit global warming a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .

a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases . in an interview with german daily die welt , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas urged germany to intensify its commitment towards cutting heat-trapping greenhouse gases and combating global warming . dimas conceded that germany is a world leader when it comes to expanding its power supply sourced from renewable energy .
but he said the country needed to catch up in other areas . dimas : german car industry needs to do more " the european union 's climate goals can only be reached if germany - europe 's biggest economy - plays along , " dimas said , adding that the car industry could definitely do more .
he underlined that the future lay in fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars and not in large fuel-guzzling ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are accused of lagging behind on environmental developments the german car industry - one of the most profitable sectors in the country - has long been under fire for failing to develop green technologies to power vehicles and focusing instead on the bottom line and on producing luxury models . in fact , the industry has been accused of trailing the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said last month . even the german government has controversially resisted pressure from the eu to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
the move was widely seen as an attempt by chancellor angela merkel 's government to protect its car industry after several companies complained of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . german leaders proud of leading role dimas ' comments are however disputed by german leaders who have long prided themselves on germany 's leading role in environmental affairs . sigmar gabriel , germany 's environment minister , on saturday pointed out that the eu had no chance of meeting its climate goals by 2012 without germany 's contribution .
gabriel stressed that his country alone was shouldering three-fourths of the bloc 's ambitious greenhouse cuts . while the eu plans to reduce its co2 emissions by eight percent against 1990 levels , germany has committed itself to cutting its levels by 21 percent , gabriel said . the environment minister also said there was agreement with the german economy ministry to provide incentives for building new power plants outfitted with modern technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still relies heavily on coal-fired power plants " in germany , we will continue to use coal because we ca n't entirely reduce our reliance on it .

we 're top and everyone else is behind us .
so of course we 're favorites when we play the bottom side at home . " gladbach are five points adrift of safety but coach jos luhukay is not overawed by what he describes as a ' david versus goliath ' duel .
" we 'll get a lot of space in schalke and could earn a point there , " he said . schalke and gladbach have won just once in the last seven games each .

dw spoke to buback 's son about the event 's legacy . founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the radical left-wing raf rose from the student protests of the late 1960s and the anti-vietnam war movement and left an indelible mark on west germany with a series of murders , bomb attacks and robberies just a generation after world war two . it is suspected of killing 34 people in west germany between 1972 and 1991 .
t he raf announced it was disbanding in 1998 . t he home-grown , left-wing terrorist organization has been in the news a lot lately .
with some convicted raf terrorists having been released from jail after serving out their sentences - most recently brigitte mohnhaupt - a debate has arisen about whether they still represent a danger to the public , or whether germans should draw a line under this brutal piece of the past . dw spoke to michael buback , the son of former german federal prosecutor , siegfried buback who was murdered in his car by the raf on april 7 , 1977 through shots fired by a person on a passing motorbike .
57-year-old buback 's driver and a guard were also killed in the attack .
the identity of the murderer remains unknown until today .
buback 's assassination sparked a series of murders of high-profile public figures by the raf in the same year which came to be known as the " german autumn . " deutsche welle : there 's been a lot discussion about convicted raf terrorists .
how do you cope with that as a relative of one of the victims ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback , son of murdered federal prosecutor siegfried buback michael buback : my feelings are mixed .
on the one hand , we relatives are happy that we put everything behind us .
it 's something you have to bear yourself .
no one can give you much help .
on the other hand , it 's of course important for us to examine the phenomenon of how such terrible crimes could have ever come about . the discussion that 's flared up shows that this phenomenon has hardly been dealt with in its entirety .
and because it 's important , we have to confront it .
that 's something we relatives have to accept .
of course , it brings back a lot of difficult moments .
i ca n't help thinking back to that day right now .
it 's terrible , but i think we have to confront terrorism .
back then only a few people were affected .
today , we 're all confronted with it .
we have to try to rid the world of this plague .
that demands intense investigation .
it requires us to collect all the known facts .
we have to see what kind of terrible crime these were , and we have to make sure they are never repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former federal prosecutor siegfried buback who was gunned down on april 7 , 1977 do victims ' relatives keep in contact with one another ? we keep in informal contact .
we do n't have organized meetings .
sometimes random groups will get together once every five or ten years .
but we do n't plan anything .
i occasionally get asked whether the interests of the victims and their relatives are taken seriously .
i always say that the victims do n't have any interests any more .
they were killed .
and the relatives do n't have interests in the normal sense .
how could we ?
we 're available for one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt , right , was released from prison last month .
christian klar remains behind bars i try to be so as far as possible .
we 've lived with the problem for 30 years .
for me it 's not a daily thing , but for my mother it is .
she 's been alone for 30 years .
i have so much to do .
i only feel it really strongly when something pushes me in that direction .
over the decades i 've always tried to relate everything i hear back to those events .
i 'm always trying to learn more and reach new insights .
those who only think about those events on anniversaries never realize that we 're still trying to make a contribution . can people who did n't directly experience this piece of history ever truly understand it ? our children have been informing themselves - especially because of all the public attention .
i think that this is an important area that everyone should be clear about .
i associate the raf with earlier horrors in german history .
we have to investigate the phenomenon that people simply decide to kill other people because they do n't fit into their picture of the world .
one of my father 's predecessors wrote in a eulogy that the raf terrorists were the true heirs to the fascist criminals .
i think there 's truth to that .
both were cold-hearted enough to simply get rid of people .
the scale was of course completely different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf enjoyed support from roughly a quarter of germans in its early years but we should be concerned about the general phenomenon , keep it in our minds and draw our lessons from it .
it can always be rekindled .
in that respect i 'm very sceptical about the discussion concerning whether to draw a line under the -lrb- raf -rrb- past .
we should never feel too secure .
until we understand that , we should n't be drawing lines under the past . michael buback was interviewed by petra diroll -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former red army faction leader mohnhaupt goes free brigitte mohnhaupt , a former leader of the red army faction group which terrorized germany in the 1970s , left jail sunday after serving 24 years for a series of guerrilla murders .

in their first public statement since their release , the sailors friday told how they were stripped , blindfolded and handcuffed as part of " psychological " intimidation during their detention . royal marine joe tindell , 21 , told how , blindfolded and their hands bound , the group at one point thought they were about to be executed and that he believed one had had his throat cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british sailors with iranian president ahmadinejad in teheran after their release the eight royal navy sailors and seven royal marines were seized as they carried out what they said were routine anti-smuggling operations near the shatt al-arab waterway that divides iraq and iran on march 23 .
tehran alleged they had entered iranian waters . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday he was releasing the 15 as a " gift " to the british people .
they returned to britain on thursday and have since been debriefed and medically assessed . iran wants " positive " response from britain as the 14 men and one woman began two weeks ' compassionate leave with their families , tehran 's ambassador to london said in an interview published saturday that britain should respond in kind to his country 's actions . rasoul movahedian told the financial times that tehran wanted london 's help in releasing five iranians held in iraq by us forces and on easing international fears about its controversial nuclear program . " we played our part and we showed our good will , " he told the business daily .
" now it is up to the british government to proceed in a positive way . " he denied ahmadinejad 's announcement was linked to the case of the iranians detained in iraq or the release monday in baghdad of an iranian diplomat kidnapped at gunpoint in iraq in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain insists its sailors were n't in iranian waters british prime minister tony blair has also insisted there were no " side " deals done to secure the 15 's release but said the behind-the-scenes diplomatic negotiations had created new lines of communication between britain and iran . movahedian said iran wanted to capitalize on this new dialogue .
" if they -lrb- the british -rrb- want to be helpful and use their influence we will welcome that .
we will welcome in general any steps that could defuse tensions in the region , " he added . sailors speak of intimidation , pressure in iran meanwhile , a british naval inquiry has been set up to establish how the 15 naval personnel came to be detained .
the sailors ' accounts of psychological and emotional torture dominated saturday 's press and media . " we had a blindfold and plastic cuffs , hands behind our backs , heads against the wall .
basically there were weapons cocking , " tindell told bbc news 24 television . " someone , i 'm not sure who , someone said , i quote , ' lads , lads , i think we 're going to get executed ' .
after that comment someone was sick and as far as i was concerned he had just had his throat cut . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair insists no deal was cut with iran over the release of the sailors the coverage was mixed with that of four british troops , two of them women , killed in southern iraq on thursday , which tempered homecoming celebrations . newspapers praised the sailors for the way they handled the situation , including not fighting back against the iranians ' superior firepower . a " suicidal firefight " when outgunned " might have started world war iii " , the sun tabloid said . and a senior iranian source close to the revolutionary guards told the guardian : " if this had been between iranian and american soldiers it could have been the beginning of an accidental war . " the guardian quoted unnamed sources as saying that britain declined a us offer to mount aggressive air patrols over the revolutionary guards . elsewhere , ahmadinejad was chided for mounting a propaganda exercise while a number of newspapers said blair 's unpopular decision to invade iraq had exposed the sailors to such risks in the first place . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's release of sailors gives hope in nuclear negotiations iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .

a pilot plant went into operation in the eastern town of jänschwalde thursday . vattenfall claims the carbon-capture plant is the first step towards co2-emission-free power generation based on coal .
the swedish-owned company built the pilot project in eastern germany where lignite mining and burning is the primary source of energy production . the jänschwalde power plant is a 1600-megawatt energy giant gobbling up more than 80 thousand tons of lignite every day .
located in the middle of the vast and barren coal fields of the eastern german state of brandenburg , it spews 25 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air - making it germany 's largest single emitter of the greenhouse gases , which are blamed for global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , a co2 sinner as of thursday , however , the technology of the last century exists side by side with that of a new era of energy production .
vattenfall europe has begun testing a plant that will capture the co2 emissions and pump them into deep rock . klaus rauscher , a member of the board of the swedish-owned company , says the technology is intended to make coal-fired power generation cleaner until alternative energy sources will be ready for commercial use . " we are sitting on enough lignite here that will last us for the next 30 to 40 years , " he said .
" but it ’ s acceptable to use this resource only if we get a grip on the huge greenhouse gas emissions .
our pilot plant is capable of resolving this problem . " burying the emissions vattenfall has spent 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- on the new plant , which produces about 50 megawatts of electricity .
the plant uses a technology called oxyfuel combustion which burns lignite in pure oxygen rather than air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are we heading - fossil fuels or renewables ?
this produces only carbon dioxide and water vapour so that emissions can easily be liquified and pumped underground .

" we will continue to need fossil fuels for a while but have to make their use more climate friendly , " said manfred fischdick , vice-president of the wuppertal climate institute .
" carbon capture is one way of doing that . " if the trial runs at the jänschwalde pilot plant turn out to be successful , vattenfall plans to set up a bigger , 300 megawatt project by 2015 .

bundesliga leaders schalke 04 welcome bottom club borussia mönchengladbach saturday looking to put last weeks defeat to bayern munich behind them while hoping that their title rivals suffer from a european hangover . schalke are two points clear of werder bremen with seven games remaining and coach mirko slomka admits his side need to start delivering better performances if the club is to win a first national title since 1958 .
" if we are to win the title , we have to improve , " said slomka . slomka 's side will be hoping european competition may have diverted the attention of two of their major challengers for the title .
fourth-placed bayern munich , whose 2-2 draw at ac milan on tuesday has left them with one foot in the champions league semi-finals , visit hanover on saturday while werder bremen , who drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in uefa cup quarter-final , first leg action on thursday , host nuremberg on sunday . schalke have some personnel problems ahead of saturday 's clash with gladbach and slomka must try and fill the void left by the suspension of fabian ernst for his fifth yellow card but , on a more positive note , serb defender mladen krstajic is back following a broken rib . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krstajic 's return will be equally celebrated krstajic has had to wear a special protective suit to help his rib recover but has finally been able to train without it .
" i 'm not scared , " the 32-year-old said on his ditching the protection .
" it 's just a different feeling , that 's all .
i 'm still being a bit careful in the tackle , but things will be very different on saturday .
at least i can breathe properly again . " slomka must also decide whether to field halil altintop .
" halil has been struggling with a groin injury for weeks , " slomka told the club 's website .
" every time he sets off on a sprint he 's in pain .
it 's a very tough and unpleasant situation for him . " what 's important is if he can say to us on friday that the pain has gone .
that was n't the case on tuesday or on wednesday , " said slomka . schalke have 53 points from 27 matches to lead by two points from werder bremen , and by four and six points from vfb stuttgart , who travel to hamburg sv on saturday , and munich respectively . bayern loss still rankles with schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay 's fast goal stunned schalke last week schalke 's 2-0 defeat at bayern on saturday was a major blow to slomka 's men and it still rankles .
" the main thing -lrb- against gladbach -rrb- is not to concede a goal after three minutes , " said krstajic , referring to roy makaay 's goal for bayern . slomka said of the gladbach match : " things always look cut and dried on paper .
we 're top and everyone else is behind us .
so of course we 're favorites when we play the bottom side at home . " gladbach are five points adrift of safety but coach jos luhukay is not overawed by what he describes as a ' david versus goliath ' duel .
" we 'll get a lot of space in schalke and could earn a point there , " he said . schalke and gladbach have won just once in the last seven games each .
but the good news for schalke is that they have not lost at home against their opponents in 11 games , winning seven and drawing four . bremen need to take chances , says klose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose takes his chances but will bremen grabs theirs ?
second-placed bremen failed to take full advantage of schalke 's slip-up against bayern last week - playing out a drab scoreless draw at lowly energie cottbus - and desperately need a win sunday at home to sixth-placed nuremberg . " we 're not going to get many more chances , " said german international miroslav klose . nuremberg will be no easy touch as the southern germans are just one point off the uefa cup spot , currently occupied by fifth-placed bayer leverkusen , who welcome relegation-threatened vfl bochum . third-placed vfb stuttgart visit improving sv hamburg , looking to cement their champions league place . stuttgart , bayern looking to increase pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have left many rivals on the deck this season stuttgart are four points behind schalke , but just two clear of defending champions bayern .
coach armin veh said the club would rate a third-place finish and a place in europe 's top club tournament next season a success . bayern will be without willy sagnol , who is out for the season with a meniscus injury picked up in italy , against hanover .
lucio , hasan salihamidzic and owen hargreaves are also injury concerns . in other matches saturday , eintracht frankfurt welcome energie cottbus , struggling borussia dortmund visit alemannia aachen , sliding hertha berlin take on arminia bielefeld and vfl wolfsburg entertain mainz 05 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leverkusen routed while bremen keep uefa cup dream alive werder bremen could be germany 's last contender in the uefa cup by the end of next week after bayer leverkusen suffered a hugely damaging 3-0 home defeat against osasuna .

dw spoke to buback 's son about the event 's legacy . founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the radical left-wing raf rose from the student protests of the late 1960s and the anti-vietnam war movement and left an indelible mark on west germany with a series of murders , bomb attacks and robberies just a generation after world war two . it is suspected of killing 34 people in west germany between 1972 and 1991 .
t he raf announced it was disbanding in 1998 . t he home-grown , left-wing terrorist organization has been in the news a lot lately .
with some convicted raf terrorists having been released from jail after serving out their sentences - most recently brigitte mohnhaupt - a debate has arisen about whether they still represent a danger to the public , or whether germans should draw a line under this brutal piece of the past . dw spoke to michael buback , the son of former german federal prosecutor , siegfried buback who was murdered in his car by the raf on april 7 , 1977 through shots fired by a person on a passing motorbike .
57-year-old buback 's driver and a guard were also killed in the attack .
the identity of the murderer remains unknown until today .
buback 's assassination sparked a series of murders of high-profile public figures by the raf in the same year which came to be known as the " german autumn . " deutsche welle : there 's been a lot discussion about convicted raf terrorists .
how do you cope with that as a relative of one of the victims ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback , son of murdered federal prosecutor siegfried buback michael buback : my feelings are mixed .
on the one hand , we relatives are happy that we put everything behind us .
it 's something you have to bear yourself .
no one can give you much help .
on the other hand , it 's of course important for us to examine the phenomenon of how such terrible crimes could have ever come about . the discussion that 's flared up shows that this phenomenon has hardly been dealt with in its entirety .
and because it 's important , we have to confront it .
that 's something we relatives have to accept .
of course , it brings back a lot of difficult moments .
i ca n't help thinking back to that day right now .
it 's terrible , but i think we have to confront terrorism .
back then only a few people were affected .
today , we 're all confronted with it .
we have to try to rid the world of this plague .
that demands intense investigation .
it requires us to collect all the known facts .
we have to see what kind of terrible crime these were , and we have to make sure they are never repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former federal prosecutor siegfried buback who was gunned down on april 7 , 1977 do victims ' relatives keep in contact with one another ? we keep in informal contact .
we do n't have organized meetings .
sometimes random groups will get together once every five or ten years .
but we do n't plan anything .
i occasionally get asked whether the interests of the victims and their relatives are taken seriously .
i always say that the victims do n't have any interests any more .
they were killed .
and the relatives do n't have interests in the normal sense .
how could we ?
we 're available for one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt , right , was released from prison last month .
christian klar remains behind bars i try to be so as far as possible .
we 've lived with the problem for 30 years .
for me it 's not a daily thing , but for my mother it is .
she 's been alone for 30 years .
i have so much to do .
i only feel it really strongly when something pushes me in that direction .
over the decades i 've always tried to relate everything i hear back to those events .
i 'm always trying to learn more and reach new insights .
those who only think about those events on anniversaries never realize that we 're still trying to make a contribution . can people who did n't directly experience this piece of history ever truly understand it ? our children have been informing themselves - especially because of all the public attention .
i think that this is an important area that everyone should be clear about .
i associate the raf with earlier horrors in german history .
we have to investigate the phenomenon that people simply decide to kill other people because they do n't fit into their picture of the world .
one of my father 's predecessors wrote in a eulogy that the raf terrorists were the true heirs to the fascist criminals .
i think there 's truth to that .
both were cold-hearted enough to simply get rid of people .
the scale was of course completely different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf enjoyed support from roughly a quarter of germans in its early years but we should be concerned about the general phenomenon , keep it in our minds and draw our lessons from it .
it can always be rekindled .
in that respect i 'm very sceptical about the discussion concerning whether to draw a line under the -lrb- raf -rrb- past .
we should never feel too secure .
until we understand that , we should n't be drawing lines under the past . michael buback was interviewed by petra diroll -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former red army faction leader mohnhaupt goes free brigitte mohnhaupt , a former leader of the red army faction group which terrorized germany in the 1970s , left jail sunday after serving 24 years for a series of guerrilla murders .

dw spoke to buback 's son about the event 's legacy . founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the radical left-wing raf rose from the student protests of the late 1960s and the anti-vietnam war movement and left an indelible mark on west germany with a series of murders , bomb attacks and robberies just a generation after world war two . it is suspected of killing 34 people in west germany between 1972 and 1991 .
t he raf announced it was disbanding in 1998 . t he home-grown , left-wing terrorist organization has been in the news a lot lately .
with some convicted raf terrorists having been released from jail after serving out their sentences - most recently brigitte mohnhaupt - a debate has arisen about whether they still represent a danger to the public , or whether germans should draw a line under this brutal piece of the past . dw spoke to michael buback , the son of former german federal prosecutor , siegfried buback who was murdered in his car by the raf on april 7 , 1977 through shots fired by a person on a passing motorbike .
57-year-old buback 's driver and a guard were also killed in the attack .
the identity of the murderer remains unknown until today .
buback 's assassination sparked a series of murders of high-profile public figures by the raf in the same year which came to be known as the " german autumn . " deutsche welle : there 's been a lot discussion about convicted raf terrorists .
how do you cope with that as a relative of one of the victims ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback , son of murdered federal prosecutor siegfried buback michael buback : my feelings are mixed .
on the one hand , we relatives are happy that we put everything behind us .
it 's something you have to bear yourself .
no one can give you much help .
on the other hand , it 's of course important for us to examine the phenomenon of how such terrible crimes could have ever come about . the discussion that 's flared up shows that this phenomenon has hardly been dealt with in its entirety .
and because it 's important , we have to confront it .
that 's something we relatives have to accept .
of course , it brings back a lot of difficult moments .
i ca n't help thinking back to that day right now .
it 's terrible , but i think we have to confront terrorism .
back then only a few people were affected .
today , we 're all confronted with it .
we have to try to rid the world of this plague .
that demands intense investigation .
it requires us to collect all the known facts .
we have to see what kind of terrible crime these were , and we have to make sure they are never repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former federal prosecutor siegfried buback who was gunned down on april 7 , 1977 do victims ' relatives keep in contact with one another ? we keep in informal contact .
we do n't have organized meetings .
sometimes random groups will get together once every five or ten years .
but we do n't plan anything .
i occasionally get asked whether the interests of the victims and their relatives are taken seriously .
i always say that the victims do n't have any interests any more .
they were killed .
and the relatives do n't have interests in the normal sense .
how could we ?
we 're available for one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt , right , was released from prison last month .
christian klar remains behind bars i try to be so as far as possible .
we 've lived with the problem for 30 years .
for me it 's not a daily thing , but for my mother it is .
she 's been alone for 30 years .
i have so much to do .
i only feel it really strongly when something pushes me in that direction .
over the decades i 've always tried to relate everything i hear back to those events .
i 'm always trying to learn more and reach new insights .
those who only think about those events on anniversaries never realize that we 're still trying to make a contribution . can people who did n't directly experience this piece of history ever truly understand it ? our children have been informing themselves - especially because of all the public attention .
i think that this is an important area that everyone should be clear about .
i associate the raf with earlier horrors in german history .
we have to investigate the phenomenon that people simply decide to kill other people because they do n't fit into their picture of the world .
one of my father 's predecessors wrote in a eulogy that the raf terrorists were the true heirs to the fascist criminals .
i think there 's truth to that .
both were cold-hearted enough to simply get rid of people .
the scale was of course completely different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf enjoyed support from roughly a quarter of germans in its early years but we should be concerned about the general phenomenon , keep it in our minds and draw our lessons from it .
it can always be rekindled .
in that respect i 'm very sceptical about the discussion concerning whether to draw a line under the -lrb- raf -rrb- past .
we should never feel too secure .

dw spoke to buback 's son about the event 's legacy . founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the radical left-wing raf rose from the student protests of the late 1960s and the anti-vietnam war movement and left an indelible mark on west germany with a series of murders , bomb attacks and robberies just a generation after world war two . it is suspected of killing 34 people in west germany between 1972 and 1991 .
t he raf announced it was disbanding in 1998 . t he home-grown , left-wing terrorist organization has been in the news a lot lately .
with some convicted raf terrorists having been released from jail after serving out their sentences - most recently brigitte mohnhaupt - a debate has arisen about whether they still represent a danger to the public , or whether germans should draw a line under this brutal piece of the past . dw spoke to michael buback , the son of former german federal prosecutor , siegfried buback who was murdered in his car by the raf on april 7 , 1977 through shots fired by a person on a passing motorbike .
57-year-old buback 's driver and a guard were also killed in the attack .
the identity of the murderer remains unknown until today .
buback 's assassination sparked a series of murders of high-profile public figures by the raf in the same year which came to be known as the " german autumn . " deutsche welle : there 's been a lot discussion about convicted raf terrorists .
how do you cope with that as a relative of one of the victims ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback , son of murdered federal prosecutor siegfried buback michael buback : my feelings are mixed .
on the one hand , we relatives are happy that we put everything behind us .
it 's something you have to bear yourself .
no one can give you much help .
on the other hand , it 's of course important for us to examine the phenomenon of how such terrible crimes could have ever come about . the discussion that 's flared up shows that this phenomenon has hardly been dealt with in its entirety .
and because it 's important , we have to confront it .
that 's something we relatives have to accept .
of course , it brings back a lot of difficult moments .
i ca n't help thinking back to that day right now .
it 's terrible , but i think we have to confront terrorism .
back then only a few people were affected .
today , we 're all confronted with it .
we have to try to rid the world of this plague .
that demands intense investigation .
it requires us to collect all the known facts .
we have to see what kind of terrible crime these were , and we have to make sure they are never repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former federal prosecutor siegfried buback who was gunned down on april 7 , 1977 do victims ' relatives keep in contact with one another ? we keep in informal contact .
we do n't have organized meetings .
sometimes random groups will get together once every five or ten years .
but we do n't plan anything .
i occasionally get asked whether the interests of the victims and their relatives are taken seriously .
i always say that the victims do n't have any interests any more .
they were killed .
and the relatives do n't have interests in the normal sense .
how could we ?
we 're available for one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt , right , was released from prison last month .
christian klar remains behind bars i try to be so as far as possible .
we 've lived with the problem for 30 years .
for me it 's not a daily thing , but for my mother it is .
she 's been alone for 30 years .
i have so much to do .
i only feel it really strongly when something pushes me in that direction .
over the decades i 've always tried to relate everything i hear back to those events .
i 'm always trying to learn more and reach new insights .
those who only think about those events on anniversaries never realize that we 're still trying to make a contribution . can people who did n't directly experience this piece of history ever truly understand it ? our children have been informing themselves - especially because of all the public attention .
i think that this is an important area that everyone should be clear about .
i associate the raf with earlier horrors in german history .
we have to investigate the phenomenon that people simply decide to kill other people because they do n't fit into their picture of the world .
one of my father 's predecessors wrote in a eulogy that the raf terrorists were the true heirs to the fascist criminals .
i think there 's truth to that .
both were cold-hearted enough to simply get rid of people .
the scale was of course completely different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf enjoyed support from roughly a quarter of germans in its early years but we should be concerned about the general phenomenon , keep it in our minds and draw our lessons from it .
it can always be rekindled .
in that respect i 'm very sceptical about the discussion concerning whether to draw a line under the -lrb- raf -rrb- past .
we should never feel too secure .
until we understand that , we should n't be drawing lines under the past . michael buback was interviewed by petra diroll -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former red army faction leader mohnhaupt goes free brigitte mohnhaupt , a former leader of the red army faction group which terrorized germany in the 1970s , left jail sunday after serving 24 years for a series of guerrilla murders .

dw spoke to buback 's son about the event 's legacy . founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the radical left-wing raf rose from the student protests of the late 1960s and the anti-vietnam war movement and left an indelible mark on west germany with a series of murders , bomb attacks and robberies just a generation after world war two . it is suspected of killing 34 people in west germany between 1972 and 1991 .
t he raf announced it was disbanding in 1998 . t he home-grown , left-wing terrorist organization has been in the news a lot lately .
with some convicted raf terrorists having been released from jail after serving out their sentences - most recently brigitte mohnhaupt - a debate has arisen about whether they still represent a danger to the public , or whether germans should draw a line under this brutal piece of the past . dw spoke to michael buback , the son of former german federal prosecutor , siegfried buback who was murdered in his car by the raf on april 7 , 1977 through shots fired by a person on a passing motorbike .
57-year-old buback 's driver and a guard were also killed in the attack .
the identity of the murderer remains unknown until today .
buback 's assassination sparked a series of murders of high-profile public figures by the raf in the same year which came to be known as the " german autumn . " deutsche welle : there 's been a lot discussion about convicted raf terrorists .

on the other hand , it 's of course important for us to examine the phenomenon of how such terrible crimes could have ever come about . the discussion that 's flared up shows that this phenomenon has hardly been dealt with in its entirety .

that 's something we relatives have to accept .
of course , it brings back a lot of difficult moments .

a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases . in an interview with german daily die welt , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas urged germany to intensify its commitment towards cutting heat-trapping greenhouse gases and combating global warming . dimas conceded that germany is a world leader when it comes to expanding its power supply sourced from renewable energy .
but he said the country needed to catch up in other areas . dimas : german car industry needs to do more " the european union 's climate goals can only be reached if germany - europe 's biggest economy - plays along , " dimas said , adding that the car industry could definitely do more .
he underlined that the future lay in fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars and not in large fuel-guzzling ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are accused of lagging behind on environmental developments the german car industry - one of the most profitable sectors in the country - has long been under fire for failing to develop green technologies to power vehicles and focusing instead on the bottom line and on producing luxury models . in fact , the industry has been accused of trailing the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said last month . even the german government has controversially resisted pressure from the eu to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
the move was widely seen as an attempt by chancellor angela merkel 's government to protect its car industry after several companies complained of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . german leaders proud of leading role dimas ' comments are however disputed by german leaders who have long prided themselves on germany 's leading role in environmental affairs . sigmar gabriel , germany 's environment minister , on saturday pointed out that the eu had no chance of meeting its climate goals by 2012 without germany 's contribution .
gabriel stressed that his country alone was shouldering three-fourths of the bloc 's ambitious greenhouse cuts . while the eu plans to reduce its co2 emissions by eight percent against 1990 levels , germany has committed itself to cutting its levels by 21 percent , gabriel said . the environment minister also said there was agreement with the german economy ministry to provide incentives for building new power plants outfitted with modern technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still relies heavily on coal-fired power plants " in germany , we will continue to use coal because we ca n't entirely reduce our reliance on it .
but we wo n't be giving it any special privileges , " gabriel told the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , adding that energy-efficient plants will take precedence instead . coal-fired power plants are one of the biggest producers of greenhouses gases , which scientists have said are primarily responsible for global warming . bleak forecast for world climate on friday , the un published a damning report on climate change , saying that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . german leaders reacted swiftly to the bleak prognosis .
the german government would continue to pioneer climate protection , said chancellor angela merkel , who pledged to raise the issue when she hosts the next g8 summit . on saturday , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee also announced plans to compel carmakers to indicate to potential buyers in a transparent way how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- different models emitted . " wide gap between german words and actions " but germany 's perceived role as a world leader in green affairs was slammed by the country 's former environment minister and head of the un environment program , klaus töpfer who said there was a wide gap between german words and actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer has lashed out at germany 's green record in an interview with welt am sonntag , töpfer warned that " germans continue to considerably affect the climate , " saying that every german on average created ten tons of carbon dioxide each year . that may make germany 's per person carbon dioxide output only half as high as that of an average american 's but on a worldwide scale germany was in the top group of the world 's worst polluters , töpfer said . the environmental expert said the per-person co2 emissions of the french stood at below seven tons , that of a chinese just about three tons while an indian only about one ton . " the bald statistics tell us that we -lrb- germans -rrb- have to do much more -lrb- to combat global warming -rrb- , " töpfer said . " most of the reduction of greenhouse gases in germany is due to cleaning up the energy sector in the former east germany and is a consequence of german reunification , " he added .
" germany must reduce its emissions to between 60 and 80 percent , " topfer said , for which there is an " urgent need for a revolutionary change in energy consumption , whether in the economic sector or in society . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says report underscores need to limit global warming a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .

bundesliga leaders schalke 04 welcome bottom club borussia mönchengladbach saturday looking to put last weeks defeat to bayern munich behind them while hoping that their title rivals suffer from a european hangover . schalke are two points clear of werder bremen with seven games remaining and coach mirko slomka admits his side need to start delivering better performances if the club is to win a first national title since 1958 .
" if we are to win the title , we have to improve , " said slomka . slomka 's side will be hoping european competition may have diverted the attention of two of their major challengers for the title .
fourth-placed bayern munich , whose 2-2 draw at ac milan on tuesday has left them with one foot in the champions league semi-finals , visit hanover on saturday while werder bremen , who drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in uefa cup quarter-final , first leg action on thursday , host nuremberg on sunday . schalke have some personnel problems ahead of saturday 's clash with gladbach and slomka must try and fill the void left by the suspension of fabian ernst for his fifth yellow card but , on a more positive note , serb defender mladen krstajic is back following a broken rib . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krstajic 's return will be equally celebrated krstajic has had to wear a special protective suit to help his rib recover but has finally been able to train without it .
" i 'm not scared , " the 32-year-old said on his ditching the protection .
" it 's just a different feeling , that 's all .
i 'm still being a bit careful in the tackle , but things will be very different on saturday .
at least i can breathe properly again . " slomka must also decide whether to field halil altintop .
" halil has been struggling with a groin injury for weeks , " slomka told the club 's website .
" every time he sets off on a sprint he 's in pain .
it 's a very tough and unpleasant situation for him . " what 's important is if he can say to us on friday that the pain has gone .
that was n't the case on tuesday or on wednesday , " said slomka . schalke have 53 points from 27 matches to lead by two points from werder bremen , and by four and six points from vfb stuttgart , who travel to hamburg sv on saturday , and munich respectively . bayern loss still rankles with schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay 's fast goal stunned schalke last week schalke 's 2-0 defeat at bayern on saturday was a major blow to slomka 's men and it still rankles .
" the main thing -lrb- against gladbach -rrb- is not to concede a goal after three minutes , " said krstajic , referring to roy makaay 's goal for bayern . slomka said of the gladbach match : " things always look cut and dried on paper .
we 're top and everyone else is behind us .
so of course we 're favorites when we play the bottom side at home . " gladbach are five points adrift of safety but coach jos luhukay is not overawed by what he describes as a ' david versus goliath ' duel .
" we 'll get a lot of space in schalke and could earn a point there , " he said . schalke and gladbach have won just once in the last seven games each .
but the good news for schalke is that they have not lost at home against their opponents in 11 games , winning seven and drawing four . bremen need to take chances , says klose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose takes his chances but will bremen grabs theirs ?
second-placed bremen failed to take full advantage of schalke 's slip-up against bayern last week - playing out a drab scoreless draw at lowly energie cottbus - and desperately need a win sunday at home to sixth-placed nuremberg . " we 're not going to get many more chances , " said german international miroslav klose . nuremberg will be no easy touch as the southern germans are just one point off the uefa cup spot , currently occupied by fifth-placed bayer leverkusen , who welcome relegation-threatened vfl bochum . third-placed vfb stuttgart visit improving sv hamburg , looking to cement their champions league place . stuttgart , bayern looking to increase pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have left many rivals on the deck this season stuttgart are four points behind schalke , but just two clear of defending champions bayern .
coach armin veh said the club would rate a third-place finish and a place in europe 's top club tournament next season a success . bayern will be without willy sagnol , who is out for the season with a meniscus injury picked up in italy , against hanover .
lucio , hasan salihamidzic and owen hargreaves are also injury concerns . in other matches saturday , eintracht frankfurt welcome energie cottbus , struggling borussia dortmund visit alemannia aachen , sliding hertha berlin take on arminia bielefeld and vfl wolfsburg entertain mainz 05 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leverkusen routed while bremen keep uefa cup dream alive werder bremen could be germany 's last contender in the uefa cup by the end of next week after bayer leverkusen suffered a hugely damaging 3-0 home defeat against osasuna .

a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases . in an interview with german daily die welt , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas urged germany to intensify its commitment towards cutting heat-trapping greenhouse gases and combating global warming . dimas conceded that germany is a world leader when it comes to expanding its power supply sourced from renewable energy .
but he said the country needed to catch up in other areas . dimas : german car industry needs to do more " the european union 's climate goals can only be reached if germany - europe 's biggest economy - plays along , " dimas said , adding that the car industry could definitely do more .
he underlined that the future lay in fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars and not in large fuel-guzzling ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are accused of lagging behind on environmental developments the german car industry - one of the most profitable sectors in the country - has long been under fire for failing to develop green technologies to power vehicles and focusing instead on the bottom line and on producing luxury models . in fact , the industry has been accused of trailing the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said last month . even the german government has controversially resisted pressure from the eu to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
the move was widely seen as an attempt by chancellor angela merkel 's government to protect its car industry after several companies complained of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . german leaders proud of leading role dimas ' comments are however disputed by german leaders who have long prided themselves on germany 's leading role in environmental affairs . sigmar gabriel , germany 's environment minister , on saturday pointed out that the eu had no chance of meeting its climate goals by 2012 without germany 's contribution .
gabriel stressed that his country alone was shouldering three-fourths of the bloc 's ambitious greenhouse cuts . while the eu plans to reduce its co2 emissions by eight percent against 1990 levels , germany has committed itself to cutting its levels by 21 percent , gabriel said . the environment minister also said there was agreement with the german economy ministry to provide incentives for building new power plants outfitted with modern technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still relies heavily on coal-fired power plants " in germany , we will continue to use coal because we ca n't entirely reduce our reliance on it .
but we wo n't be giving it any special privileges , " gabriel told the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , adding that energy-efficient plants will take precedence instead . coal-fired power plants are one of the biggest producers of greenhouses gases , which scientists have said are primarily responsible for global warming . bleak forecast for world climate on friday , the un published a damning report on climate change , saying that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . german leaders reacted swiftly to the bleak prognosis .
the german government would continue to pioneer climate protection , said chancellor angela merkel , who pledged to raise the issue when she hosts the next g8 summit . on saturday , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee also announced plans to compel carmakers to indicate to potential buyers in a transparent way how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- different models emitted . " wide gap between german words and actions " but germany 's perceived role as a world leader in green affairs was slammed by the country 's former environment minister and head of the un environment program , klaus töpfer who said there was a wide gap between german words and actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer has lashed out at germany 's green record in an interview with welt am sonntag , töpfer warned that " germans continue to considerably affect the climate , " saying that every german on average created ten tons of carbon dioxide each year . that may make germany 's per person carbon dioxide output only half as high as that of an average american 's but on a worldwide scale germany was in the top group of the world 's worst polluters , töpfer said . the environmental expert said the per-person co2 emissions of the french stood at below seven tons , that of a chinese just about three tons while an indian only about one ton . " the bald statistics tell us that we -lrb- germans -rrb- have to do much more -lrb- to combat global warming -rrb- , " töpfer said . " most of the reduction of greenhouse gases in germany is due to cleaning up the energy sector in the former east germany and is a consequence of german reunification , " he added .
" germany must reduce its emissions to between 60 and 80 percent , " topfer said , for which there is an " urgent need for a revolutionary change in energy consumption , whether in the economic sector or in society . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says report underscores need to limit global warming a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .
but the us , china and russia stand accused of seeking to water down some sections .
-lrb- 06.04.07 -rrb- eu 's environmental policy flounders as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering .
-lrb- 05.04.07 -rrb- despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .
yet over 20 coal-fired power plants - major producers of greenhouse gases - are planned for germany .

a pilot plant went into operation in the eastern town of jänschwalde thursday . vattenfall claims the carbon-capture plant is the first step towards co2-emission-free power generation based on coal .
the swedish-owned company built the pilot project in eastern germany where lignite mining and burning is the primary source of energy production . the jänschwalde power plant is a 1600-megawatt energy giant gobbling up more than 80 thousand tons of lignite every day .
located in the middle of the vast and barren coal fields of the eastern german state of brandenburg , it spews 25 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air - making it germany 's largest single emitter of the greenhouse gases , which are blamed for global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , a co2 sinner as of thursday , however , the technology of the last century exists side by side with that of a new era of energy production .
vattenfall europe has begun testing a plant that will capture the co2 emissions and pump them into deep rock . klaus rauscher , a member of the board of the swedish-owned company , says the technology is intended to make coal-fired power generation cleaner until alternative energy sources will be ready for commercial use . " we are sitting on enough lignite here that will last us for the next 30 to 40 years , " he said .
" but it ’ s acceptable to use this resource only if we get a grip on the huge greenhouse gas emissions .
our pilot plant is capable of resolving this problem . " burying the emissions vattenfall has spent 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- on the new plant , which produces about 50 megawatts of electricity .
the plant uses a technology called oxyfuel combustion which burns lignite in pure oxygen rather than air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are we heading - fossil fuels or renewables ?
this produces only carbon dioxide and water vapour so that emissions can easily be liquified and pumped underground .
it is said to be the most cost-effective method of capturing carbon dioxide . " for us researchers it ’ s like entering uncharted territory with only our pioneering spirit to help us along , " said hans joachim krautz , who along with his research team at cottbus technical university in brandenburg , developed the process . vattenfall has yet to find proper storage facilities for the captured co2 , but claims that this should not be a problem as exhausted natural gas deposits , for example , are well suited for that . long-term solution ? critics of the technology say dumping greenhouse gases underground is not the long-term answer , and reducing emissions must take priority . but even environmentalists say that there may be little other choice for the time being . " we will continue to need fossil fuels for a while but have to make their use more climate friendly , " said manfred fischdick , vice-president of the wuppertal climate institute .
" carbon capture is one way of doing that . " if the trial runs at the jänschwalde pilot plant turn out to be successful , vattenfall plans to set up a bigger , 300 megawatt project by 2015 .

a pilot plant went into operation in the eastern town of jänschwalde thursday . vattenfall claims the carbon-capture plant is the first step towards co2-emission-free power generation based on coal .
the swedish-owned company built the pilot project in eastern germany where lignite mining and burning is the primary source of energy production . the jänschwalde power plant is a 1600-megawatt energy giant gobbling up more than 80 thousand tons of lignite every day .
located in the middle of the vast and barren coal fields of the eastern german state of brandenburg , it spews 25 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air - making it germany 's largest single emitter of the greenhouse gases , which are blamed for global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , a co2 sinner as of thursday , however , the technology of the last century exists side by side with that of a new era of energy production .
vattenfall europe has begun testing a plant that will capture the co2 emissions and pump them into deep rock . klaus rauscher , a member of the board of the swedish-owned company , says the technology is intended to make coal-fired power generation cleaner until alternative energy sources will be ready for commercial use . " we are sitting on enough lignite here that will last us for the next 30 to 40 years , " he said .
" but it ’ s acceptable to use this resource only if we get a grip on the huge greenhouse gas emissions .

in their first public statement since their release , the sailors friday told how they were stripped , blindfolded and handcuffed as part of " psychological " intimidation during their detention . royal marine joe tindell , 21 , told how , blindfolded and their hands bound , the group at one point thought they were about to be executed and that he believed one had had his throat cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british sailors with iranian president ahmadinejad in teheran after their release the eight royal navy sailors and seven royal marines were seized as they carried out what they said were routine anti-smuggling operations near the shatt al-arab waterway that divides iraq and iran on march 23 .
tehran alleged they had entered iranian waters . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday he was releasing the 15 as a " gift " to the british people .
they returned to britain on thursday and have since been debriefed and medically assessed . iran wants " positive " response from britain as the 14 men and one woman began two weeks ' compassionate leave with their families , tehran 's ambassador to london said in an interview published saturday that britain should respond in kind to his country 's actions . rasoul movahedian told the financial times that tehran wanted london 's help in releasing five iranians held in iraq by us forces and on easing international fears about its controversial nuclear program . " we played our part and we showed our good will , " he told the business daily .
" now it is up to the british government to proceed in a positive way . " he denied ahmadinejad 's announcement was linked to the case of the iranians detained in iraq or the release monday in baghdad of an iranian diplomat kidnapped at gunpoint in iraq in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain insists its sailors were n't in iranian waters british prime minister tony blair has also insisted there were no " side " deals done to secure the 15 's release but said the behind-the-scenes diplomatic negotiations had created new lines of communication between britain and iran . movahedian said iran wanted to capitalize on this new dialogue .
" if they -lrb- the british -rrb- want to be helpful and use their influence we will welcome that .
we will welcome in general any steps that could defuse tensions in the region , " he added . sailors speak of intimidation , pressure in iran meanwhile , a british naval inquiry has been set up to establish how the 15 naval personnel came to be detained .
the sailors ' accounts of psychological and emotional torture dominated saturday 's press and media . " we had a blindfold and plastic cuffs , hands behind our backs , heads against the wall .
basically there were weapons cocking , " tindell told bbc news 24 television . " someone , i 'm not sure who , someone said , i quote , ' lads , lads , i think we 're going to get executed ' .
after that comment someone was sick and as far as i was concerned he had just had his throat cut . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair insists no deal was cut with iran over the release of the sailors the coverage was mixed with that of four british troops , two of them women , killed in southern iraq on thursday , which tempered homecoming celebrations . newspapers praised the sailors for the way they handled the situation , including not fighting back against the iranians ' superior firepower . a " suicidal firefight " when outgunned " might have started world war iii " , the sun tabloid said . and a senior iranian source close to the revolutionary guards told the guardian : " if this had been between iranian and american soldiers it could have been the beginning of an accidental war . " the guardian quoted unnamed sources as saying that britain declined a us offer to mount aggressive air patrols over the revolutionary guards . elsewhere , ahmadinejad was chided for mounting a propaganda exercise while a number of newspapers said blair 's unpopular decision to invade iraq had exposed the sailors to such risks in the first place . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's release of sailors gives hope in nuclear negotiations iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .

a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases . in an interview with german daily die welt , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas urged germany to intensify its commitment towards cutting heat-trapping greenhouse gases and combating global warming . dimas conceded that germany is a world leader when it comes to expanding its power supply sourced from renewable energy .
but he said the country needed to catch up in other areas . dimas : german car industry needs to do more " the european union 's climate goals can only be reached if germany - europe 's biggest economy - plays along , " dimas said , adding that the car industry could definitely do more .
he underlined that the future lay in fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars and not in large fuel-guzzling ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are accused of lagging behind on environmental developments the german car industry - one of the most profitable sectors in the country - has long been under fire for failing to develop green technologies to power vehicles and focusing instead on the bottom line and on producing luxury models . in fact , the industry has been accused of trailing the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said last month . even the german government has controversially resisted pressure from the eu to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
the move was widely seen as an attempt by chancellor angela merkel 's government to protect its car industry after several companies complained of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . german leaders proud of leading role dimas ' comments are however disputed by german leaders who have long prided themselves on germany 's leading role in environmental affairs . sigmar gabriel , germany 's environment minister , on saturday pointed out that the eu had no chance of meeting its climate goals by 2012 without germany 's contribution .
gabriel stressed that his country alone was shouldering three-fourths of the bloc 's ambitious greenhouse cuts . while the eu plans to reduce its co2 emissions by eight percent against 1990 levels , germany has committed itself to cutting its levels by 21 percent , gabriel said . the environment minister also said there was agreement with the german economy ministry to provide incentives for building new power plants outfitted with modern technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still relies heavily on coal-fired power plants " in germany , we will continue to use coal because we ca n't entirely reduce our reliance on it .

" most of the reduction of greenhouse gases in germany is due to cleaning up the energy sector in the former east germany and is a consequence of german reunification , " he added .

bundesliga leaders schalke 04 welcome bottom club borussia mönchengladbach saturday looking to put last weeks defeat to bayern munich behind them while hoping that their title rivals suffer from a european hangover . schalke are two points clear of werder bremen with seven games remaining and coach mirko slomka admits his side need to start delivering better performances if the club is to win a first national title since 1958 .
" if we are to win the title , we have to improve , " said slomka . slomka 's side will be hoping european competition may have diverted the attention of two of their major challengers for the title .
fourth-placed bayern munich , whose 2-2 draw at ac milan on tuesday has left them with one foot in the champions league semi-finals , visit hanover on saturday while werder bremen , who drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in uefa cup quarter-final , first leg action on thursday , host nuremberg on sunday . schalke have some personnel problems ahead of saturday 's clash with gladbach and slomka must try and fill the void left by the suspension of fabian ernst for his fifth yellow card but , on a more positive note , serb defender mladen krstajic is back following a broken rib . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krstajic 's return will be equally celebrated krstajic has had to wear a special protective suit to help his rib recover but has finally been able to train without it .
" i 'm not scared , " the 32-year-old said on his ditching the protection .
" it 's just a different feeling , that 's all .
i 'm still being a bit careful in the tackle , but things will be very different on saturday .
at least i can breathe properly again . " slomka must also decide whether to field halil altintop .
" halil has been struggling with a groin injury for weeks , " slomka told the club 's website .
" every time he sets off on a sprint he 's in pain .
it 's a very tough and unpleasant situation for him . " what 's important is if he can say to us on friday that the pain has gone .
that was n't the case on tuesday or on wednesday , " said slomka . schalke have 53 points from 27 matches to lead by two points from werder bremen , and by four and six points from vfb stuttgart , who travel to hamburg sv on saturday , and munich respectively . bayern loss still rankles with schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay 's fast goal stunned schalke last week schalke 's 2-0 defeat at bayern on saturday was a major blow to slomka 's men and it still rankles .
" the main thing -lrb- against gladbach -rrb- is not to concede a goal after three minutes , " said krstajic , referring to roy makaay 's goal for bayern . slomka said of the gladbach match : " things always look cut and dried on paper .
we 're top and everyone else is behind us .
so of course we 're favorites when we play the bottom side at home . " gladbach are five points adrift of safety but coach jos luhukay is not overawed by what he describes as a ' david versus goliath ' duel .
" we 'll get a lot of space in schalke and could earn a point there , " he said . schalke and gladbach have won just once in the last seven games each .
but the good news for schalke is that they have not lost at home against their opponents in 11 games , winning seven and drawing four . bremen need to take chances , says klose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose takes his chances but will bremen grabs theirs ?
second-placed bremen failed to take full advantage of schalke 's slip-up against bayern last week - playing out a drab scoreless draw at lowly energie cottbus - and desperately need a win sunday at home to sixth-placed nuremberg . " we 're not going to get many more chances , " said german international miroslav klose . nuremberg will be no easy touch as the southern germans are just one point off the uefa cup spot , currently occupied by fifth-placed bayer leverkusen , who welcome relegation-threatened vfl bochum . third-placed vfb stuttgart visit improving sv hamburg , looking to cement their champions league place . stuttgart , bayern looking to increase pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have left many rivals on the deck this season stuttgart are four points behind schalke , but just two clear of defending champions bayern .
coach armin veh said the club would rate a third-place finish and a place in europe 's top club tournament next season a success . bayern will be without willy sagnol , who is out for the season with a meniscus injury picked up in italy , against hanover .
lucio , hasan salihamidzic and owen hargreaves are also injury concerns . in other matches saturday , eintracht frankfurt welcome energie cottbus , struggling borussia dortmund visit alemannia aachen , sliding hertha berlin take on arminia bielefeld and vfl wolfsburg entertain mainz 05 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leverkusen routed while bremen keep uefa cup dream alive werder bremen could be germany 's last contender in the uefa cup by the end of next week after bayer leverkusen suffered a hugely damaging 3-0 home defeat against osasuna .

in their first public statement since their release , the sailors friday told how they were stripped , blindfolded and handcuffed as part of " psychological " intimidation during their detention . royal marine joe tindell , 21 , told how , blindfolded and their hands bound , the group at one point thought they were about to be executed and that he believed one had had his throat cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british sailors with iranian president ahmadinejad in teheran after their release the eight royal navy sailors and seven royal marines were seized as they carried out what they said were routine anti-smuggling operations near the shatt al-arab waterway that divides iraq and iran on march 23 .
tehran alleged they had entered iranian waters . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday he was releasing the 15 as a " gift " to the british people .
they returned to britain on thursday and have since been debriefed and medically assessed . iran wants " positive " response from britain as the 14 men and one woman began two weeks ' compassionate leave with their families , tehran 's ambassador to london said in an interview published saturday that britain should respond in kind to his country 's actions . rasoul movahedian told the financial times that tehran wanted london 's help in releasing five iranians held in iraq by us forces and on easing international fears about its controversial nuclear program . " we played our part and we showed our good will , " he told the business daily .
" now it is up to the british government to proceed in a positive way . " he denied ahmadinejad 's announcement was linked to the case of the iranians detained in iraq or the release monday in baghdad of an iranian diplomat kidnapped at gunpoint in iraq in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain insists its sailors were n't in iranian waters british prime minister tony blair has also insisted there were no " side " deals done to secure the 15 's release but said the behind-the-scenes diplomatic negotiations had created new lines of communication between britain and iran . movahedian said iran wanted to capitalize on this new dialogue .
" if they -lrb- the british -rrb- want to be helpful and use their influence we will welcome that .
we will welcome in general any steps that could defuse tensions in the region , " he added . sailors speak of intimidation , pressure in iran meanwhile , a british naval inquiry has been set up to establish how the 15 naval personnel came to be detained .
the sailors ' accounts of psychological and emotional torture dominated saturday 's press and media . " we had a blindfold and plastic cuffs , hands behind our backs , heads against the wall .
basically there were weapons cocking , " tindell told bbc news 24 television . " someone , i 'm not sure who , someone said , i quote , ' lads , lads , i think we 're going to get executed ' .
after that comment someone was sick and as far as i was concerned he had just had his throat cut . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair insists no deal was cut with iran over the release of the sailors the coverage was mixed with that of four british troops , two of them women , killed in southern iraq on thursday , which tempered homecoming celebrations . newspapers praised the sailors for the way they handled the situation , including not fighting back against the iranians ' superior firepower . a " suicidal firefight " when outgunned " might have started world war iii " , the sun tabloid said . and a senior iranian source close to the revolutionary guards told the guardian : " if this had been between iranian and american soldiers it could have been the beginning of an accidental war . " the guardian quoted unnamed sources as saying that britain declined a us offer to mount aggressive air patrols over the revolutionary guards . elsewhere , ahmadinejad was chided for mounting a propaganda exercise while a number of newspapers said blair 's unpopular decision to invade iraq had exposed the sailors to such risks in the first place . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's release of sailors gives hope in nuclear negotiations iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .

bundesliga leaders schalke 04 welcome bottom club borussia mönchengladbach saturday looking to put last weeks defeat to bayern munich behind them while hoping that their title rivals suffer from a european hangover . schalke are two points clear of werder bremen with seven games remaining and coach mirko slomka admits his side need to start delivering better performances if the club is to win a first national title since 1958 .
" if we are to win the title , we have to improve , " said slomka . slomka 's side will be hoping european competition may have diverted the attention of two of their major challengers for the title .
fourth-placed bayern munich , whose 2-2 draw at ac milan on tuesday has left them with one foot in the champions league semi-finals , visit hanover on saturday while werder bremen , who drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in uefa cup quarter-final , first leg action on thursday , host nuremberg on sunday . schalke have some personnel problems ahead of saturday 's clash with gladbach and slomka must try and fill the void left by the suspension of fabian ernst for his fifth yellow card but , on a more positive note , serb defender mladen krstajic is back following a broken rib . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krstajic 's return will be equally celebrated krstajic has had to wear a special protective suit to help his rib recover but has finally been able to train without it .
" i 'm not scared , " the 32-year-old said on his ditching the protection .
" it 's just a different feeling , that 's all .
i 'm still being a bit careful in the tackle , but things will be very different on saturday .
at least i can breathe properly again . " slomka must also decide whether to field halil altintop .
" halil has been struggling with a groin injury for weeks , " slomka told the club 's website .
" every time he sets off on a sprint he 's in pain .
it 's a very tough and unpleasant situation for him . " what 's important is if he can say to us on friday that the pain has gone .
that was n't the case on tuesday or on wednesday , " said slomka . schalke have 53 points from 27 matches to lead by two points from werder bremen , and by four and six points from vfb stuttgart , who travel to hamburg sv on saturday , and munich respectively . bayern loss still rankles with schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay 's fast goal stunned schalke last week schalke 's 2-0 defeat at bayern on saturday was a major blow to slomka 's men and it still rankles .
" the main thing -lrb- against gladbach -rrb- is not to concede a goal after three minutes , " said krstajic , referring to roy makaay 's goal for bayern . slomka said of the gladbach match : " things always look cut and dried on paper .
we 're top and everyone else is behind us .
so of course we 're favorites when we play the bottom side at home . " gladbach are five points adrift of safety but coach jos luhukay is not overawed by what he describes as a ' david versus goliath ' duel .
" we 'll get a lot of space in schalke and could earn a point there , " he said . schalke and gladbach have won just once in the last seven games each .
but the good news for schalke is that they have not lost at home against their opponents in 11 games , winning seven and drawing four . bremen need to take chances , says klose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose takes his chances but will bremen grabs theirs ?
second-placed bremen failed to take full advantage of schalke 's slip-up against bayern last week - playing out a drab scoreless draw at lowly energie cottbus - and desperately need a win sunday at home to sixth-placed nuremberg . " we 're not going to get many more chances , " said german international miroslav klose . nuremberg will be no easy touch as the southern germans are just one point off the uefa cup spot , currently occupied by fifth-placed bayer leverkusen , who welcome relegation-threatened vfl bochum . third-placed vfb stuttgart visit improving sv hamburg , looking to cement their champions league place . stuttgart , bayern looking to increase pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have left many rivals on the deck this season stuttgart are four points behind schalke , but just two clear of defending champions bayern .
coach armin veh said the club would rate a third-place finish and a place in europe 's top club tournament next season a success . bayern will be without willy sagnol , who is out for the season with a meniscus injury picked up in italy , against hanover .
lucio , hasan salihamidzic and owen hargreaves are also injury concerns . in other matches saturday , eintracht frankfurt welcome energie cottbus , struggling borussia dortmund visit alemannia aachen , sliding hertha berlin take on arminia bielefeld and vfl wolfsburg entertain mainz 05 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leverkusen routed while bremen keep uefa cup dream alive werder bremen could be germany 's last contender in the uefa cup by the end of next week after bayer leverkusen suffered a hugely damaging 3-0 home defeat against osasuna .

dw spoke to buback 's son about the event 's legacy . founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the radical left-wing raf rose from the student protests of the late 1960s and the anti-vietnam war movement and left an indelible mark on west germany with a series of murders , bomb attacks and robberies just a generation after world war two . it is suspected of killing 34 people in west germany between 1972 and 1991 .
t he raf announced it was disbanding in 1998 . t he home-grown , left-wing terrorist organization has been in the news a lot lately .
with some convicted raf terrorists having been released from jail after serving out their sentences - most recently brigitte mohnhaupt - a debate has arisen about whether they still represent a danger to the public , or whether germans should draw a line under this brutal piece of the past . dw spoke to michael buback , the son of former german federal prosecutor , siegfried buback who was murdered in his car by the raf on april 7 , 1977 through shots fired by a person on a passing motorbike .
57-year-old buback 's driver and a guard were also killed in the attack .
the identity of the murderer remains unknown until today .
buback 's assassination sparked a series of murders of high-profile public figures by the raf in the same year which came to be known as the " german autumn . " deutsche welle : there 's been a lot discussion about convicted raf terrorists .
how do you cope with that as a relative of one of the victims ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback , son of murdered federal prosecutor siegfried buback michael buback : my feelings are mixed .
on the one hand , we relatives are happy that we put everything behind us .
it 's something you have to bear yourself .
no one can give you much help .
on the other hand , it 's of course important for us to examine the phenomenon of how such terrible crimes could have ever come about . the discussion that 's flared up shows that this phenomenon has hardly been dealt with in its entirety .
and because it 's important , we have to confront it .
that 's something we relatives have to accept .
of course , it brings back a lot of difficult moments .
i ca n't help thinking back to that day right now .
it 's terrible , but i think we have to confront terrorism .
back then only a few people were affected .
today , we 're all confronted with it .
we have to try to rid the world of this plague .
that demands intense investigation .
it requires us to collect all the known facts .
we have to see what kind of terrible crime these were , and we have to make sure they are never repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former federal prosecutor siegfried buback who was gunned down on april 7 , 1977 do victims ' relatives keep in contact with one another ? we keep in informal contact .
we do n't have organized meetings .
sometimes random groups will get together once every five or ten years .
but we do n't plan anything .
i occasionally get asked whether the interests of the victims and their relatives are taken seriously .
i always say that the victims do n't have any interests any more .
they were killed .
and the relatives do n't have interests in the normal sense .
how could we ?
we 're available for one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt , right , was released from prison last month .
christian klar remains behind bars i try to be so as far as possible .
we 've lived with the problem for 30 years .
for me it 's not a daily thing , but for my mother it is .
she 's been alone for 30 years .
i have so much to do .
i only feel it really strongly when something pushes me in that direction .
over the decades i 've always tried to relate everything i hear back to those events .
i 'm always trying to learn more and reach new insights .
those who only think about those events on anniversaries never realize that we 're still trying to make a contribution . can people who did n't directly experience this piece of history ever truly understand it ? our children have been informing themselves - especially because of all the public attention .
i think that this is an important area that everyone should be clear about .
i associate the raf with earlier horrors in german history .
we have to investigate the phenomenon that people simply decide to kill other people because they do n't fit into their picture of the world .
one of my father 's predecessors wrote in a eulogy that the raf terrorists were the true heirs to the fascist criminals .
i think there 's truth to that .
both were cold-hearted enough to simply get rid of people .
the scale was of course completely different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf enjoyed support from roughly a quarter of germans in its early years but we should be concerned about the general phenomenon , keep it in our minds and draw our lessons from it .
it can always be rekindled .
in that respect i 'm very sceptical about the discussion concerning whether to draw a line under the -lrb- raf -rrb- past .
we should never feel too secure .

dw spoke to buback 's son about the event 's legacy . founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the radical left-wing raf rose from the student protests of the late 1960s and the anti-vietnam war movement and left an indelible mark on west germany with a series of murders , bomb attacks and robberies just a generation after world war two . it is suspected of killing 34 people in west germany between 1972 and 1991 .
t he raf announced it was disbanding in 1998 . t he home-grown , left-wing terrorist organization has been in the news a lot lately .
with some convicted raf terrorists having been released from jail after serving out their sentences - most recently brigitte mohnhaupt - a debate has arisen about whether they still represent a danger to the public , or whether germans should draw a line under this brutal piece of the past . dw spoke to michael buback , the son of former german federal prosecutor , siegfried buback who was murdered in his car by the raf on april 7 , 1977 through shots fired by a person on a passing motorbike .
57-year-old buback 's driver and a guard were also killed in the attack .
the identity of the murderer remains unknown until today .
buback 's assassination sparked a series of murders of high-profile public figures by the raf in the same year which came to be known as the " german autumn . " deutsche welle : there 's been a lot discussion about convicted raf terrorists .
how do you cope with that as a relative of one of the victims ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback , son of murdered federal prosecutor siegfried buback michael buback : my feelings are mixed .
on the one hand , we relatives are happy that we put everything behind us .
it 's something you have to bear yourself .
no one can give you much help .
on the other hand , it 's of course important for us to examine the phenomenon of how such terrible crimes could have ever come about . the discussion that 's flared up shows that this phenomenon has hardly been dealt with in its entirety .
and because it 's important , we have to confront it .
that 's something we relatives have to accept .
of course , it brings back a lot of difficult moments .
i ca n't help thinking back to that day right now .
it 's terrible , but i think we have to confront terrorism .
back then only a few people were affected .
today , we 're all confronted with it .
we have to try to rid the world of this plague .
that demands intense investigation .
it requires us to collect all the known facts .
we have to see what kind of terrible crime these were , and we have to make sure they are never repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former federal prosecutor siegfried buback who was gunned down on april 7 , 1977 do victims ' relatives keep in contact with one another ? we keep in informal contact .
we do n't have organized meetings .
sometimes random groups will get together once every five or ten years .
but we do n't plan anything .
i occasionally get asked whether the interests of the victims and their relatives are taken seriously .
i always say that the victims do n't have any interests any more .
they were killed .

a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases . in an interview with german daily die welt , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas urged germany to intensify its commitment towards cutting heat-trapping greenhouse gases and combating global warming . dimas conceded that germany is a world leader when it comes to expanding its power supply sourced from renewable energy .
but he said the country needed to catch up in other areas . dimas : german car industry needs to do more " the european union 's climate goals can only be reached if germany - europe 's biggest economy - plays along , " dimas said , adding that the car industry could definitely do more .
he underlined that the future lay in fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars and not in large fuel-guzzling ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are accused of lagging behind on environmental developments the german car industry - one of the most profitable sectors in the country - has long been under fire for failing to develop green technologies to power vehicles and focusing instead on the bottom line and on producing luxury models . in fact , the industry has been accused of trailing the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said last month . even the german government has controversially resisted pressure from the eu to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
the move was widely seen as an attempt by chancellor angela merkel 's government to protect its car industry after several companies complained of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . german leaders proud of leading role dimas ' comments are however disputed by german leaders who have long prided themselves on germany 's leading role in environmental affairs . sigmar gabriel , germany 's environment minister , on saturday pointed out that the eu had no chance of meeting its climate goals by 2012 without germany 's contribution .
gabriel stressed that his country alone was shouldering three-fourths of the bloc 's ambitious greenhouse cuts . while the eu plans to reduce its co2 emissions by eight percent against 1990 levels , germany has committed itself to cutting its levels by 21 percent , gabriel said . the environment minister also said there was agreement with the german economy ministry to provide incentives for building new power plants outfitted with modern technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still relies heavily on coal-fired power plants " in germany , we will continue to use coal because we ca n't entirely reduce our reliance on it .
but we wo n't be giving it any special privileges , " gabriel told the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , adding that energy-efficient plants will take precedence instead . coal-fired power plants are one of the biggest producers of greenhouses gases , which scientists have said are primarily responsible for global warming . bleak forecast for world climate on friday , the un published a damning report on climate change , saying that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . german leaders reacted swiftly to the bleak prognosis .
the german government would continue to pioneer climate protection , said chancellor angela merkel , who pledged to raise the issue when she hosts the next g8 summit . on saturday , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee also announced plans to compel carmakers to indicate to potential buyers in a transparent way how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- different models emitted . " wide gap between german words and actions " but germany 's perceived role as a world leader in green affairs was slammed by the country 's former environment minister and head of the un environment program , klaus töpfer who said there was a wide gap between german words and actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer has lashed out at germany 's green record in an interview with welt am sonntag , töpfer warned that " germans continue to considerably affect the climate , " saying that every german on average created ten tons of carbon dioxide each year . that may make germany 's per person carbon dioxide output only half as high as that of an average american 's but on a worldwide scale germany was in the top group of the world 's worst polluters , töpfer said . the environmental expert said the per-person co2 emissions of the french stood at below seven tons , that of a chinese just about three tons while an indian only about one ton . " the bald statistics tell us that we -lrb- germans -rrb- have to do much more -lrb- to combat global warming -rrb- , " töpfer said . " most of the reduction of greenhouse gases in germany is due to cleaning up the energy sector in the former east germany and is a consequence of german reunification , " he added .

in their first public statement since their release , the sailors friday told how they were stripped , blindfolded and handcuffed as part of " psychological " intimidation during their detention . royal marine joe tindell , 21 , told how , blindfolded and their hands bound , the group at one point thought they were about to be executed and that he believed one had had his throat cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british sailors with iranian president ahmadinejad in teheran after their release the eight royal navy sailors and seven royal marines were seized as they carried out what they said were routine anti-smuggling operations near the shatt al-arab waterway that divides iraq and iran on march 23 .
tehran alleged they had entered iranian waters . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday he was releasing the 15 as a " gift " to the british people .
they returned to britain on thursday and have since been debriefed and medically assessed . iran wants " positive " response from britain as the 14 men and one woman began two weeks ' compassionate leave with their families , tehran 's ambassador to london said in an interview published saturday that britain should respond in kind to his country 's actions . rasoul movahedian told the financial times that tehran wanted london 's help in releasing five iranians held in iraq by us forces and on easing international fears about its controversial nuclear program . " we played our part and we showed our good will , " he told the business daily .
" now it is up to the british government to proceed in a positive way . " he denied ahmadinejad 's announcement was linked to the case of the iranians detained in iraq or the release monday in baghdad of an iranian diplomat kidnapped at gunpoint in iraq in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain insists its sailors were n't in iranian waters british prime minister tony blair has also insisted there were no " side " deals done to secure the 15 's release but said the behind-the-scenes diplomatic negotiations had created new lines of communication between britain and iran . movahedian said iran wanted to capitalize on this new dialogue .
" if they -lrb- the british -rrb- want to be helpful and use their influence we will welcome that .
we will welcome in general any steps that could defuse tensions in the region , " he added . sailors speak of intimidation , pressure in iran meanwhile , a british naval inquiry has been set up to establish how the 15 naval personnel came to be detained .
the sailors ' accounts of psychological and emotional torture dominated saturday 's press and media . " we had a blindfold and plastic cuffs , hands behind our backs , heads against the wall .
basically there were weapons cocking , " tindell told bbc news 24 television . " someone , i 'm not sure who , someone said , i quote , ' lads , lads , i think we 're going to get executed ' .
after that comment someone was sick and as far as i was concerned he had just had his throat cut . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair insists no deal was cut with iran over the release of the sailors the coverage was mixed with that of four british troops , two of them women , killed in southern iraq on thursday , which tempered homecoming celebrations . newspapers praised the sailors for the way they handled the situation , including not fighting back against the iranians ' superior firepower . a " suicidal firefight " when outgunned " might have started world war iii " , the sun tabloid said . and a senior iranian source close to the revolutionary guards told the guardian : " if this had been between iranian and american soldiers it could have been the beginning of an accidental war . " the guardian quoted unnamed sources as saying that britain declined a us offer to mount aggressive air patrols over the revolutionary guards . elsewhere , ahmadinejad was chided for mounting a propaganda exercise while a number of newspapers said blair 's unpopular decision to invade iraq had exposed the sailors to such risks in the first place . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's release of sailors gives hope in nuclear negotiations iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .

a pilot plant went into operation in the eastern town of jänschwalde thursday . vattenfall claims the carbon-capture plant is the first step towards co2-emission-free power generation based on coal .
the swedish-owned company built the pilot project in eastern germany where lignite mining and burning is the primary source of energy production . the jänschwalde power plant is a 1600-megawatt energy giant gobbling up more than 80 thousand tons of lignite every day .
located in the middle of the vast and barren coal fields of the eastern german state of brandenburg , it spews 25 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air - making it germany 's largest single emitter of the greenhouse gases , which are blamed for global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , a co2 sinner as of thursday , however , the technology of the last century exists side by side with that of a new era of energy production .
vattenfall europe has begun testing a plant that will capture the co2 emissions and pump them into deep rock . klaus rauscher , a member of the board of the swedish-owned company , says the technology is intended to make coal-fired power generation cleaner until alternative energy sources will be ready for commercial use . " we are sitting on enough lignite here that will last us for the next 30 to 40 years , " he said .
" but it ’ s acceptable to use this resource only if we get a grip on the huge greenhouse gas emissions .
our pilot plant is capable of resolving this problem . " burying the emissions vattenfall has spent 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- on the new plant , which produces about 50 megawatts of electricity .
the plant uses a technology called oxyfuel combustion which burns lignite in pure oxygen rather than air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are we heading - fossil fuels or renewables ?
this produces only carbon dioxide and water vapour so that emissions can easily be liquified and pumped underground .
it is said to be the most cost-effective method of capturing carbon dioxide . " for us researchers it ’ s like entering uncharted territory with only our pioneering spirit to help us along , " said hans joachim krautz , who along with his research team at cottbus technical university in brandenburg , developed the process . vattenfall has yet to find proper storage facilities for the captured co2 , but claims that this should not be a problem as exhausted natural gas deposits , for example , are well suited for that . long-term solution ? critics of the technology say dumping greenhouse gases underground is not the long-term answer , and reducing emissions must take priority . but even environmentalists say that there may be little other choice for the time being . " we will continue to need fossil fuels for a while but have to make their use more climate friendly , " said manfred fischdick , vice-president of the wuppertal climate institute .
" carbon capture is one way of doing that . " if the trial runs at the jänschwalde pilot plant turn out to be successful , vattenfall plans to set up a bigger , 300 megawatt project by 2015 .
the first commercial co2-emission-free lignite plant , the company says , is then likely to go into operation by 2020 . hardy graupner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says report underscores need to limit global warming a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .

a pilot plant went into operation in the eastern town of jänschwalde thursday . vattenfall claims the carbon-capture plant is the first step towards co2-emission-free power generation based on coal .
the swedish-owned company built the pilot project in eastern germany where lignite mining and burning is the primary source of energy production . the jänschwalde power plant is a 1600-megawatt energy giant gobbling up more than 80 thousand tons of lignite every day .
located in the middle of the vast and barren coal fields of the eastern german state of brandenburg , it spews 25 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air - making it germany 's largest single emitter of the greenhouse gases , which are blamed for global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , a co2 sinner as of thursday , however , the technology of the last century exists side by side with that of a new era of energy production .
vattenfall europe has begun testing a plant that will capture the co2 emissions and pump them into deep rock . klaus rauscher , a member of the board of the swedish-owned company , says the technology is intended to make coal-fired power generation cleaner until alternative energy sources will be ready for commercial use . " we are sitting on enough lignite here that will last us for the next 30 to 40 years , " he said .
" but it ’ s acceptable to use this resource only if we get a grip on the huge greenhouse gas emissions .
our pilot plant is capable of resolving this problem . " burying the emissions vattenfall has spent 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- on the new plant , which produces about 50 megawatts of electricity .
the plant uses a technology called oxyfuel combustion which burns lignite in pure oxygen rather than air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are we heading - fossil fuels or renewables ?
this produces only carbon dioxide and water vapour so that emissions can easily be liquified and pumped underground .
it is said to be the most cost-effective method of capturing carbon dioxide . " for us researchers it ’ s like entering uncharted territory with only our pioneering spirit to help us along , " said hans joachim krautz , who along with his research team at cottbus technical university in brandenburg , developed the process . vattenfall has yet to find proper storage facilities for the captured co2 , but claims that this should not be a problem as exhausted natural gas deposits , for example , are well suited for that . long-term solution ? critics of the technology say dumping greenhouse gases underground is not the long-term answer , and reducing emissions must take priority . but even environmentalists say that there may be little other choice for the time being . " we will continue to need fossil fuels for a while but have to make their use more climate friendly , " said manfred fischdick , vice-president of the wuppertal climate institute .
" carbon capture is one way of doing that . " if the trial runs at the jänschwalde pilot plant turn out to be successful , vattenfall plans to set up a bigger , 300 megawatt project by 2015 .

a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases . in an interview with german daily die welt , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas urged germany to intensify its commitment towards cutting heat-trapping greenhouse gases and combating global warming . dimas conceded that germany is a world leader when it comes to expanding its power supply sourced from renewable energy .
but he said the country needed to catch up in other areas . dimas : german car industry needs to do more " the european union 's climate goals can only be reached if germany - europe 's biggest economy - plays along , " dimas said , adding that the car industry could definitely do more .
he underlined that the future lay in fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars and not in large fuel-guzzling ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are accused of lagging behind on environmental developments the german car industry - one of the most profitable sectors in the country - has long been under fire for failing to develop green technologies to power vehicles and focusing instead on the bottom line and on producing luxury models . in fact , the industry has been accused of trailing the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said last month . even the german government has controversially resisted pressure from the eu to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
the move was widely seen as an attempt by chancellor angela merkel 's government to protect its car industry after several companies complained of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . german leaders proud of leading role dimas ' comments are however disputed by german leaders who have long prided themselves on germany 's leading role in environmental affairs . sigmar gabriel , germany 's environment minister , on saturday pointed out that the eu had no chance of meeting its climate goals by 2012 without germany 's contribution .
gabriel stressed that his country alone was shouldering three-fourths of the bloc 's ambitious greenhouse cuts . while the eu plans to reduce its co2 emissions by eight percent against 1990 levels , germany has committed itself to cutting its levels by 21 percent , gabriel said . the environment minister also said there was agreement with the german economy ministry to provide incentives for building new power plants outfitted with modern technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still relies heavily on coal-fired power plants " in germany , we will continue to use coal because we ca n't entirely reduce our reliance on it .
but we wo n't be giving it any special privileges , " gabriel told the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , adding that energy-efficient plants will take precedence instead . coal-fired power plants are one of the biggest producers of greenhouses gases , which scientists have said are primarily responsible for global warming . bleak forecast for world climate on friday , the un published a damning report on climate change , saying that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . german leaders reacted swiftly to the bleak prognosis .
the german government would continue to pioneer climate protection , said chancellor angela merkel , who pledged to raise the issue when she hosts the next g8 summit . on saturday , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee also announced plans to compel carmakers to indicate to potential buyers in a transparent way how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- different models emitted . " wide gap between german words and actions " but germany 's perceived role as a world leader in green affairs was slammed by the country 's former environment minister and head of the un environment program , klaus töpfer who said there was a wide gap between german words and actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer has lashed out at germany 's green record in an interview with welt am sonntag , töpfer warned that " germans continue to considerably affect the climate , " saying that every german on average created ten tons of carbon dioxide each year . that may make germany 's per person carbon dioxide output only half as high as that of an average american 's but on a worldwide scale germany was in the top group of the world 's worst polluters , töpfer said . the environmental expert said the per-person co2 emissions of the french stood at below seven tons , that of a chinese just about three tons while an indian only about one ton . " the bald statistics tell us that we -lrb- germans -rrb- have to do much more -lrb- to combat global warming -rrb- , " töpfer said . " most of the reduction of greenhouse gases in germany is due to cleaning up the energy sector in the former east germany and is a consequence of german reunification , " he added .
" germany must reduce its emissions to between 60 and 80 percent , " topfer said , for which there is an " urgent need for a revolutionary change in energy consumption , whether in the economic sector or in society .

a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases . in an interview with german daily die welt , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas urged germany to intensify its commitment towards cutting heat-trapping greenhouse gases and combating global warming . dimas conceded that germany is a world leader when it comes to expanding its power supply sourced from renewable energy .
but he said the country needed to catch up in other areas . dimas : german car industry needs to do more " the european union 's climate goals can only be reached if germany - europe 's biggest economy - plays along , " dimas said , adding that the car industry could definitely do more .
he underlined that the future lay in fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars and not in large fuel-guzzling ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are accused of lagging behind on environmental developments the german car industry - one of the most profitable sectors in the country - has long been under fire for failing to develop green technologies to power vehicles and focusing instead on the bottom line and on producing luxury models . in fact , the industry has been accused of trailing the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said last month . even the german government has controversially resisted pressure from the eu to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
the move was widely seen as an attempt by chancellor angela merkel 's government to protect its car industry after several companies complained of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . german leaders proud of leading role dimas ' comments are however disputed by german leaders who have long prided themselves on germany 's leading role in environmental affairs . sigmar gabriel , germany 's environment minister , on saturday pointed out that the eu had no chance of meeting its climate goals by 2012 without germany 's contribution .
gabriel stressed that his country alone was shouldering three-fourths of the bloc 's ambitious greenhouse cuts . while the eu plans to reduce its co2 emissions by eight percent against 1990 levels , germany has committed itself to cutting its levels by 21 percent , gabriel said . the environment minister also said there was agreement with the german economy ministry to provide incentives for building new power plants outfitted with modern technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still relies heavily on coal-fired power plants " in germany , we will continue to use coal because we ca n't entirely reduce our reliance on it .
but we wo n't be giving it any special privileges , " gabriel told the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , adding that energy-efficient plants will take precedence instead . coal-fired power plants are one of the biggest producers of greenhouses gases , which scientists have said are primarily responsible for global warming . bleak forecast for world climate on friday , the un published a damning report on climate change , saying that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . german leaders reacted swiftly to the bleak prognosis .
the german government would continue to pioneer climate protection , said chancellor angela merkel , who pledged to raise the issue when she hosts the next g8 summit . on saturday , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee also announced plans to compel carmakers to indicate to potential buyers in a transparent way how much carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- different models emitted . " wide gap between german words and actions " but germany 's perceived role as a world leader in green affairs was slammed by the country 's former environment minister and head of the un environment program , klaus töpfer who said there was a wide gap between german words and actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer has lashed out at germany 's green record in an interview with welt am sonntag , töpfer warned that " germans continue to considerably affect the climate , " saying that every german on average created ten tons of carbon dioxide each year . that may make germany 's per person carbon dioxide output only half as high as that of an average american 's but on a worldwide scale germany was in the top group of the world 's worst polluters , töpfer said . the environmental expert said the per-person co2 emissions of the french stood at below seven tons , that of a chinese just about three tons while an indian only about one ton . " the bald statistics tell us that we -lrb- germans -rrb- have to do much more -lrb- to combat global warming -rrb- , " töpfer said . " most of the reduction of greenhouse gases in germany is due to cleaning up the energy sector in the former east germany and is a consequence of german reunification , " he added .
" germany must reduce its emissions to between 60 and 80 percent , " topfer said , for which there is an " urgent need for a revolutionary change in energy consumption , whether in the economic sector or in society . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says report underscores need to limit global warming a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .
but the us , china and russia stand accused of seeking to water down some sections .
-lrb- 06.04.07 -rrb- eu 's environmental policy flounders as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering .
-lrb- 05.04.07 -rrb- despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .
yet over 20 coal-fired power plants - major producers of greenhouse gases - are planned for germany .

bundesliga leaders schalke 04 welcome bottom club borussia mönchengladbach saturday looking to put last weeks defeat to bayern munich behind them while hoping that their title rivals suffer from a european hangover . schalke are two points clear of werder bremen with seven games remaining and coach mirko slomka admits his side need to start delivering better performances if the club is to win a first national title since 1958 .
" if we are to win the title , we have to improve , " said slomka . slomka 's side will be hoping european competition may have diverted the attention of two of their major challengers for the title .
fourth-placed bayern munich , whose 2-2 draw at ac milan on tuesday has left them with one foot in the champions league semi-finals , visit hanover on saturday while werder bremen , who drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in uefa cup quarter-final , first leg action on thursday , host nuremberg on sunday . schalke have some personnel problems ahead of saturday 's clash with gladbach and slomka must try and fill the void left by the suspension of fabian ernst for his fifth yellow card but , on a more positive note , serb defender mladen krstajic is back following a broken rib . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krstajic 's return will be equally celebrated krstajic has had to wear a special protective suit to help his rib recover but has finally been able to train without it .

at least i can breathe properly again . " slomka must also decide whether to field halil altintop .
" halil has been struggling with a groin injury for weeks , " slomka told the club 's website .
" every time he sets off on a sprint he 's in pain .
it 's a very tough and unpleasant situation for him . " what 's important is if he can say to us on friday that the pain has gone .
that was n't the case on tuesday or on wednesday , " said slomka . schalke have 53 points from 27 matches to lead by two points from werder bremen , and by four and six points from vfb stuttgart , who travel to hamburg sv on saturday , and munich respectively . bayern loss still rankles with schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay 's fast goal stunned schalke last week schalke 's 2-0 defeat at bayern on saturday was a major blow to slomka 's men and it still rankles .

we 're top and everyone else is behind us .
so of course we 're favorites when we play the bottom side at home . " gladbach are five points adrift of safety but coach jos luhukay is not overawed by what he describes as a ' david versus goliath ' duel .
" we 'll get a lot of space in schalke and could earn a point there , " he said . schalke and gladbach have won just once in the last seven games each .

at least i can breathe properly again . " slomka must also decide whether to field halil altintop .
" halil has been struggling with a groin injury for weeks , " slomka told the club 's website .
" every time he sets off on a sprint he 's in pain .
it 's a very tough and unpleasant situation for him . " what 's important is if he can say to us on friday that the pain has gone .
that was n't the case on tuesday or on wednesday , " said slomka . schalke have 53 points from 27 matches to lead by two points from werder bremen , and by four and six points from vfb stuttgart , who travel to hamburg sv on saturday , and munich respectively . bayern loss still rankles with schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay 's fast goal stunned schalke last week schalke 's 2-0 defeat at bayern on saturday was a major blow to slomka 's men and it still rankles .
" the main thing -lrb- against gladbach -rrb- is not to concede a goal after three minutes , " said krstajic , referring to roy makaay 's goal for bayern . slomka said of the gladbach match : " things always look cut and dried on paper .
we 're top and everyone else is behind us .
so of course we 're favorites when we play the bottom side at home . " gladbach are five points adrift of safety but coach jos luhukay is not overawed by what he describes as a ' david versus goliath ' duel .
" we 'll get a lot of space in schalke and could earn a point there , " he said . schalke and gladbach have won just once in the last seven games each .
but the good news for schalke is that they have not lost at home against their opponents in 11 games , winning seven and drawing four . bremen need to take chances , says klose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose takes his chances but will bremen grabs theirs ?
second-placed bremen failed to take full advantage of schalke 's slip-up against bayern last week - playing out a drab scoreless draw at lowly energie cottbus - and desperately need a win sunday at home to sixth-placed nuremberg . " we 're not going to get many more chances , " said german international miroslav klose . nuremberg will be no easy touch as the southern germans are just one point off the uefa cup spot , currently occupied by fifth-placed bayer leverkusen , who welcome relegation-threatened vfl bochum . third-placed vfb stuttgart visit improving sv hamburg , looking to cement their champions league place . stuttgart , bayern looking to increase pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have left many rivals on the deck this season stuttgart are four points behind schalke , but just two clear of defending champions bayern .
coach armin veh said the club would rate a third-place finish and a place in europe 's top club tournament next season a success . bayern will be without willy sagnol , who is out for the season with a meniscus injury picked up in italy , against hanover .
lucio , hasan salihamidzic and owen hargreaves are also injury concerns . in other matches saturday , eintracht frankfurt welcome energie cottbus , struggling borussia dortmund visit alemannia aachen , sliding hertha berlin take on arminia bielefeld and vfl wolfsburg entertain mainz 05 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leverkusen routed while bremen keep uefa cup dream alive werder bremen could be germany 's last contender in the uefa cup by the end of next week after bayer leverkusen suffered a hugely damaging 3-0 home defeat against osasuna .

dw spoke to buback 's son about the event 's legacy . founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the radical left-wing raf rose from the student protests of the late 1960s and the anti-vietnam war movement and left an indelible mark on west germany with a series of murders , bomb attacks and robberies just a generation after world war two . it is suspected of killing 34 people in west germany between 1972 and 1991 .
t he raf announced it was disbanding in 1998 . t he home-grown , left-wing terrorist organization has been in the news a lot lately .
with some convicted raf terrorists having been released from jail after serving out their sentences - most recently brigitte mohnhaupt - a debate has arisen about whether they still represent a danger to the public , or whether germans should draw a line under this brutal piece of the past . dw spoke to michael buback , the son of former german federal prosecutor , siegfried buback who was murdered in his car by the raf on april 7 , 1977 through shots fired by a person on a passing motorbike .
57-year-old buback 's driver and a guard were also killed in the attack .
the identity of the murderer remains unknown until today .
buback 's assassination sparked a series of murders of high-profile public figures by the raf in the same year which came to be known as the " german autumn . " deutsche welle : there 's been a lot discussion about convicted raf terrorists .
how do you cope with that as a relative of one of the victims ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback , son of murdered federal prosecutor siegfried buback michael buback : my feelings are mixed .
on the one hand , we relatives are happy that we put everything behind us .
it 's something you have to bear yourself .
no one can give you much help .
on the other hand , it 's of course important for us to examine the phenomenon of how such terrible crimes could have ever come about . the discussion that 's flared up shows that this phenomenon has hardly been dealt with in its entirety .
and because it 's important , we have to confront it .
that 's something we relatives have to accept .
of course , it brings back a lot of difficult moments .
i ca n't help thinking back to that day right now .
it 's terrible , but i think we have to confront terrorism .
back then only a few people were affected .
today , we 're all confronted with it .
we have to try to rid the world of this plague .
that demands intense investigation .
it requires us to collect all the known facts .
we have to see what kind of terrible crime these were , and we have to make sure they are never repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former federal prosecutor siegfried buback who was gunned down on april 7 , 1977 do victims ' relatives keep in contact with one another ? we keep in informal contact .
we do n't have organized meetings .
sometimes random groups will get together once every five or ten years .
but we do n't plan anything .
i occasionally get asked whether the interests of the victims and their relatives are taken seriously .

they were killed .

i think that this is an important area that everyone should be clear about .
i associate the raf with earlier horrors in german history .
we have to investigate the phenomenon that people simply decide to kill other people because they do n't fit into their picture of the world .
one of my father 's predecessors wrote in a eulogy that the raf terrorists were the true heirs to the fascist criminals .

dw spoke to buback 's son about the event 's legacy . founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the radical left-wing raf rose from the student protests of the late 1960s and the anti-vietnam war movement and left an indelible mark on west germany with a series of murders , bomb attacks and robberies just a generation after world war two . it is suspected of killing 34 people in west germany between 1972 and 1991 .
t he raf announced it was disbanding in 1998 . t he home-grown , left-wing terrorist organization has been in the news a lot lately .
with some convicted raf terrorists having been released from jail after serving out their sentences - most recently brigitte mohnhaupt - a debate has arisen about whether they still represent a danger to the public , or whether germans should draw a line under this brutal piece of the past . dw spoke to michael buback , the son of former german federal prosecutor , siegfried buback who was murdered in his car by the raf on april 7 , 1977 through shots fired by a person on a passing motorbike .
57-year-old buback 's driver and a guard were also killed in the attack .
the identity of the murderer remains unknown until today .
buback 's assassination sparked a series of murders of high-profile public figures by the raf in the same year which came to be known as the " german autumn . " deutsche welle : there 's been a lot discussion about convicted raf terrorists .
how do you cope with that as a relative of one of the victims ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback , son of murdered federal prosecutor siegfried buback michael buback : my feelings are mixed .
on the one hand , we relatives are happy that we put everything behind us .
it 's something you have to bear yourself .
no one can give you much help .
on the other hand , it 's of course important for us to examine the phenomenon of how such terrible crimes could have ever come about . the discussion that 's flared up shows that this phenomenon has hardly been dealt with in its entirety .
and because it 's important , we have to confront it .
that 's something we relatives have to accept .
of course , it brings back a lot of difficult moments .
i ca n't help thinking back to that day right now .
it 's terrible , but i think we have to confront terrorism .
back then only a few people were affected .
today , we 're all confronted with it .
we have to try to rid the world of this plague .
that demands intense investigation .
it requires us to collect all the known facts .
we have to see what kind of terrible crime these were , and we have to make sure they are never repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former federal prosecutor siegfried buback who was gunned down on april 7 , 1977 do victims ' relatives keep in contact with one another ? we keep in informal contact .
we do n't have organized meetings .
sometimes random groups will get together once every five or ten years .
but we do n't plan anything .
i occasionally get asked whether the interests of the victims and their relatives are taken seriously .
i always say that the victims do n't have any interests any more .
they were killed .
and the relatives do n't have interests in the normal sense .
how could we ?
we 're available for one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt , right , was released from prison last month .
christian klar remains behind bars i try to be so as far as possible .
we 've lived with the problem for 30 years .
for me it 's not a daily thing , but for my mother it is .
she 's been alone for 30 years .
i have so much to do .
i only feel it really strongly when something pushes me in that direction .
over the decades i 've always tried to relate everything i hear back to those events .
i 'm always trying to learn more and reach new insights .
those who only think about those events on anniversaries never realize that we 're still trying to make a contribution . can people who did n't directly experience this piece of history ever truly understand it ? our children have been informing themselves - especially because of all the public attention .
i think that this is an important area that everyone should be clear about .
i associate the raf with earlier horrors in german history .
we have to investigate the phenomenon that people simply decide to kill other people because they do n't fit into their picture of the world .
one of my father 's predecessors wrote in a eulogy that the raf terrorists were the true heirs to the fascist criminals .
i think there 's truth to that .
both were cold-hearted enough to simply get rid of people .
the scale was of course completely different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf enjoyed support from roughly a quarter of germans in its early years but we should be concerned about the general phenomenon , keep it in our minds and draw our lessons from it .
it can always be rekindled .
in that respect i 'm very sceptical about the discussion concerning whether to draw a line under the -lrb- raf -rrb- past .
we should never feel too secure .
until we understand that , we should n't be drawing lines under the past . michael buback was interviewed by petra diroll -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former red army faction leader mohnhaupt goes free brigitte mohnhaupt , a former leader of the red army faction group which terrorized germany in the 1970s , left jail sunday after serving 24 years for a series of guerrilla murders .

on the other hand , it 's of course important for us to examine the phenomenon of how such terrible crimes could have ever come about . the discussion that 's flared up shows that this phenomenon has hardly been dealt with in its entirety .
and because it 's important , we have to confront it .
that 's something we relatives have to accept .
of course , it brings back a lot of difficult moments .
i ca n't help thinking back to that day right now .
it 's terrible , but i think we have to confront terrorism .
back then only a few people were affected .
today , we 're all confronted with it .
we have to try to rid the world of this plague .
that demands intense investigation .
it requires us to collect all the known facts .
we have to see what kind of terrible crime these were , and we have to make sure they are never repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former federal prosecutor siegfried buback who was gunned down on april 7 , 1977 do victims ' relatives keep in contact with one another ? we keep in informal contact .
we do n't have organized meetings .
sometimes random groups will get together once every five or ten years .
but we do n't plan anything .
i occasionally get asked whether the interests of the victims and their relatives are taken seriously .
i always say that the victims do n't have any interests any more .
they were killed .
and the relatives do n't have interests in the normal sense .
how could we ?
we 're available for one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt , right , was released from prison last month .
christian klar remains behind bars i try to be so as far as possible .
we 've lived with the problem for 30 years .
for me it 's not a daily thing , but for my mother it is .
she 's been alone for 30 years .
i have so much to do .
i only feel it really strongly when something pushes me in that direction .
over the decades i 've always tried to relate everything i hear back to those events .
i 'm always trying to learn more and reach new insights .
those who only think about those events on anniversaries never realize that we 're still trying to make a contribution . can people who did n't directly experience this piece of history ever truly understand it ? our children have been informing themselves - especially because of all the public attention .
i think that this is an important area that everyone should be clear about .
i associate the raf with earlier horrors in german history .
we have to investigate the phenomenon that people simply decide to kill other people because they do n't fit into their picture of the world .
one of my father 's predecessors wrote in a eulogy that the raf terrorists were the true heirs to the fascist criminals .
i think there 's truth to that .
both were cold-hearted enough to simply get rid of people .
the scale was of course completely different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf enjoyed support from roughly a quarter of germans in its early years but we should be concerned about the general phenomenon , keep it in our minds and draw our lessons from it .
it can always be rekindled .
in that respect i 'm very sceptical about the discussion concerning whether to draw a line under the -lrb- raf -rrb- past .
we should never feel too secure .
until we understand that , we should n't be drawing lines under the past . michael buback was interviewed by petra diroll -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former red army faction leader mohnhaupt goes free brigitte mohnhaupt , a former leader of the red army faction group which terrorized germany in the 1970s , left jail sunday after serving 24 years for a series of guerrilla murders .
-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- release of former militant sparks mixed feelings in germany most german political parties consider the release of the one-time terrorist and red army faction leader brigitte mohnhaupt as a sign of justice .
but conservative leaders and the victims ' families are more critical .

only 12 % of attacks on the railways are detected , according to figures from the british transport police .
the force says there were more than 2,500 incidents of so-called route crime in the 12 months to march .
crimes included missiles being thrown at trains as well as attempts to derail rolling stock .
the police say the detection rate of such crimes is low but add that the level of route crime has dropped 16 % compared with the previous 12 months .
last week a train driver narrowly missed being blinded in one eye after stones shattered the windscreen of his cab .
the force says attacks on the rail network typically increase during the school holidays as most of them are carried out by children .
drivers have also reported everything from car bonnets to shopping trolleys and double beds being thrown or dragged on to rail lines to see what happens if a train hits them .
the british transport police -lrb- btp -rrb- say the detection rate is low because of the unique problems of trying to police the railways .
' startling increase in crime ' meanwhile , the conservatives said that figures from the btp showed that there had been a dramatic increase in the number of offensive weapons found on trains in england and wales .
the number of crimes recorded for the possession of offensive weapons increased from 618 in 2005/6 to 818 for the period between 1 april 2006 and 21 january 2007 .
the final figure for this year is not yet available .

no judge has ever ruled on whether charges of £ 30 or more to bounce a payment are legal as the banks have always paid up to prevent court action .
but a barrister now believes he can force the issue to court and is seeking a key ruling on friday .
he is demanding the right to claim damages on top of a refund and has rejected an offer to settle the action .
tom brennan , who ran up £ 2,500 in penalties on an unauthorised overdraft when he was a law student , told bbc radio 4 's money box what he is asking the court .
" i am arguing for what are called ' exemplary damages ' .
where a company acts unlawfully and then takes unlawful profits from a person they should face a substantial level of damages to strip them of those profits , " he said .
he shares the view of many consumer groups that the charges levied by banks when people exceed their overdraft limit or a payment is bounced are illegal .
" consumer protection regulations state clearly that you ca n't charge a disproportionate level of charges for any breach of contract , " he said .
" the information i have from my experts it that it will cost £ 2.50 or thereabouts to bounce a direct debit .
the bank charges me £ 38 . "
consumer action major campaigns by consumer groups have led to tens of thousands of people recovering bank charges .
more than two million form letters have been downloaded from one website alone .
in every case the banks eventually pay up - sometimes at the court steps - so the legality of the charges has never been tested .
they 've offered me £ 4,000 but i 've rejected it tom brennan , barrister mr brennan says his approach will force natwest to defend its actions in court .
he has refused an offer well in excess of the penalty charges taken by the bank .
" they 've offered me £ 4,000 but i 've rejected it because they keep saying the charges are both fair and lawful but i do n't agree , " he said .
if the court rules against him he could pay a heavy price .
" if i lose and they state that i am acting unreasonably they can ask for their costs , " he said .
" they are employing senior barristers .
it would bankrupt me , and that prevents you being a practising barrister or transferring to be a solicitor .
" but that will only happen if the judge awards costs and he may not if he decides i am bringing this for public reasons .
this case has a momentum of its own and is too important to walk away . "
in a statement , natwest confirmed that the case was being defended but " it would be inappropriate to comment further " .
the case will be heard on friday , 13 april in the mayor 's and city of london county court at guildhall .

the force says there were more than 2,500 incidents of so-called route crime in the 12 months to march .
crimes included missiles being thrown at trains as well as attempts to derail rolling stock .
the police say the detection rate of such crimes is low but add that the level of route crime has dropped 16 % compared with the previous 12 months .
last week a train driver narrowly missed being blinded in one eye after stones shattered the windscreen of his cab .
the force says attacks on the rail network typically increase during the school holidays as most of them are carried out by children .
drivers have also reported everything from car bonnets to shopping trolleys and double beds being thrown or dragged on to rail lines to see what happens if a train hits them .
the british transport police -lrb- btp -rrb- say the detection rate is low because of the unique problems of trying to police the railways .
' startling increase in crime ' meanwhile , the conservatives said that figures from the btp showed that there had been a dramatic increase in the number of offensive weapons found on trains in england and wales .
the number of crimes recorded for the possession of offensive weapons increased from 618 in 2005/6 to 818 for the period between 1 april 2006 and 21 january 2007 .
the final figure for this year is not yet available .
chris grayling , the shadow transport secretary , said : " this is another sad reflection on the state of our public transport .
" the reality is that people are becoming increasingly scared of using buses and trains late at night and these figures show why .
" how can the government hope to encourage people out of their cars and on to public transport when there are such startling increases in crime ? "

a un-chartered ship , the mv rozen , and the indian mv nimatullah were released on friday , andrew mwangura of the seafarers ' assistance programme said .
mr mwangura said the crews of both ships were safe .
one report quoted him as saying a ransom had been paid .
piracy was rampant in somalia , but stopped during recent islamist rule .
the mv rozen was seized along with its 12-strong crew in february while trying to deliver food aid to the war-torn country .
the indian dhow , which had 14 crew members , was hijacked after it tried to deliver 800 tons of cargo to the somali capital , mogadishu .
mr mwangura said both vessels were now on their way to kenya .
since the overthrow of the union of islamic courts at the turn of the year , somalia has been descending back into the violence and chaos seen in the previous 16 years .
maritime officials fear the recent hijackings may signal a resumption of lawlessness on the seas .

and no wonder he beamed broadly as they all lined up to shake his hand and offer apologies .
he was the hero in a fairy-tale that had just reached its happy ending , a tale that spoke of his generosity and of iran 's desire for good relations with other nations .
" just a compulsory vacation , " he joked to one of the young sailors , as though they had spent the entire last two weeks playing chess and nibbling pistachio nuts , sitting on red carpets in rooms with floral wall paper - like the scenes in the footage released by iranian tv .
well , now they have got back home we have heard a rather different story .
not so much a fairy-tale .
more of a nightmare .
' mind games ' far from straying into iranian territory , the british crew say they were well within iraqi waters when revolutionary guards rammed their vessels and trained machine guns on them .
once arrested , they were blindfolded , their hands tied and lined up against a wall , while they could hear the sound of guns being cocked .
" not exactly a mock execution , " said one officer stoically , but admitted he had never been so scared in his life .
they were kept isolated , in small cells , subjected to aggressive questioning and what they called " mind games " .
they were told to confess on camera , or risk up to seven years in jail .
it sounds as though faye turney had the worst of it .
for four days she thought she was alone , and the others had been sent home .
once they had all recorded tv interviews , conditions improved .
but the footage of them we saw was , they told us , a massive propaganda stunt .
once the filming was over , they were blindfolded and taken back to their cells .
even after they met the president , they were blindfolded and taken under guard to a hotel .
a holiday , compulsory or otherwise , it was not .
quiet diplomacy of course iran now disputes that account , and claims the sailors ' news conference was staged to win propaganda points .
the war of words between the two sides over this saga goes on .
what one can glean about british attempts to solve the crisis is also instructive .
over that two-week period , it went through ups and downs .
from the start , the british government seemed confident the incident was premeditated and the british crew had been arrested illegally .
the problem was working out why and persuading iran to hand them back .
at first the foreign office tried quiet diplomacy .
but the extended iranian new year meant many senior iranians were unavailable .
" you ca n't just phone them on your mobile like you can a british minister , " complained one official .
london 's suspicion was that the different power bases in tehran would not work out what to do with them until the holiday was over .
five days in , british patience was wearing thin .
margaret beckett called the iranian foreign minister to warn him britain was giving iran until 1230 on wednesday to act , or it would go public with its evidence and enter - as tony blair put it - " a different phase " .
from quiet diplomacy britain abruptly switched to pulling out the stops .
bilateral ties were frozen .
appeals were made to the un security council and to eu foreign ministers to join britain 's protest .
it was a pretty risky strategy .
iran 's immediate reaction was to drop the idea of releasing faye turney early .
british officials tried to argue that they had never believed the promise anyway .
late-night calls at the un , several countries , including russia , were reluctant to take sides .
the final security council appeal was watered down and did not even demand the captives ' immediate release . "
when president ahmadinejad 's dramatic announcement came , the british government was it seems , as stunned as everyone else " it did not look good .
by now britain was asking anyone it could think of to ratchet up the pressure .
even syria was asked to help .
even colombia in latin america called in the iranian ambassador .
at one point , apparently , margaret beckett 's office tried to reach the iranian foreign minister by phone , to be told by a complaining aide : " mr mottaki is having to take quite a lot of calls already as a result of your activities . "
eleven days in , iran had sent london a note of protest , and london had sent one back , apparently offering to de-escalate the row by talking bilaterally , but british officials were agitated .
with no reply back from tehran , they seemed unsure what would happen next .
then , iran 's chief negotiator popped up on british television and signalled that iran wanted bilateral diplomacy .
britain seized on this , hoping iran now wanted to talk , and followed it up with a late night phone call to him from tony blair 's office .
they hoped talks might start soon .
but that was all .
margaret beckett even publicly warned against a swift resolution .
' in the dark ' so when president ahmadinejad 's dramatic announcement came , the british government was it seems , as stunned as everyone else .
in tehran , british diplomats rushed to the presidential palace , frantically trying to get access .
foreign journalists exchanged a word with the newly pardoned sailors long before the british ambassador was allowed to see them .
the british government was kept firmly out of the loop , as far as one can tell .
the moral of the tale is that the gap between iranian claims and what is really going on may be quite great .
but do not rely on the british government to have the answer .
relations between britain and iran were strained before this crisis and have probably got worse .
there is n't always a conspiracy or a backroom deal .
quite often diplomats , like the rest of us , are working in the dark .

and no wonder he beamed broadly as they all lined up to shake his hand and offer apologies .
he was the hero in a fairy-tale that had just reached its happy ending , a tale that spoke of his generosity and of iran 's desire for good relations with other nations .
" just a compulsory vacation , " he joked to one of the young sailors , as though they had spent the entire last two weeks playing chess and nibbling pistachio nuts , sitting on red carpets in rooms with floral wall paper - like the scenes in the footage released by iranian tv .
well , now they have got back home we have heard a rather different story .
not so much a fairy-tale .
more of a nightmare .
' mind games ' far from straying into iranian territory , the british crew say they were well within iraqi waters when revolutionary guards rammed their vessels and trained machine guns on them .
in their filmed accounts in iran , crew members praised iranians once arrested , they were blindfolded , their hands tied and lined up against a wall , while they could hear the sound of guns being cocked .
" not exactly a mock execution , " said one officer stoically , but admitted he had never been so scared in his life .
they were kept isolated , in small cells , subjected to aggressive questioning and what they called " mind games " .
they were told to confess on camera , or risk up to seven years in jail .
it sounds as though faye turney had the worst of it .
for four days she thought she was alone , and the others had been sent home .
once they had all recorded tv interviews , conditions improved .
but the footage of them we saw was , they told us , a massive propaganda stunt .
once the filming was over , they were blindfolded and taken back to their cells .
even after they met the president , they were blindfolded and taken under guard to a hotel .
a holiday , compulsory or otherwise , it was not .
quiet diplomacy of course iran now disputes that account , and claims the sailors ' news conference was staged to win propaganda points .
the war of words between the two sides over this saga goes on .
what one can glean about british attempts to solve the crisis is also instructive .
over that two-week period , it went through ups and downs .
mr blair insisted no deal was done to free the 15 navy personnel from the start , the british government seemed confident the incident was premeditated and the british crew had been arrested illegally .
the problem was working out why and persuading iran to hand them back .
at first the foreign office tried quiet diplomacy .
but the extended iranian new year meant many senior iranians were unavailable .
" you ca n't just phone them on your mobile like you can a british minister , " complained one official .
london 's suspicion was that the different power bases in tehran would not work out what to do with them until the holiday was over .
five days in , british patience was wearing thin .
margaret beckett called the iranian foreign minister to warn him britain was giving iran until 1230 on wednesday to act , or it would go public with its evidence and enter - as tony blair put it - " a different phase " .
from quiet diplomacy britain abruptly switched to pulling out the stops .
bilateral ties were frozen .
appeals were made to the un security council and to eu foreign ministers to join britain 's protest .
it was a pretty risky strategy .
iran 's immediate reaction was to drop the idea of releasing faye turney early .
british officials tried to argue that they had never believed the promise anyway .
late-night calls at the un , several countries , including russia , were reluctant to take sides .
the final security council appeal was watered down and did not even demand the captives ' immediate release .
when president ahmadinejad 's dramatic announcement came , the british government was it seems , as stunned as everyone else it did not look good .
by now britain was asking anyone it could think of to ratchet up the pressure .
even syria was asked to help .
even colombia in latin america called in the iranian ambassador .
at one point , apparently , margaret beckett 's office tried to reach the iranian foreign minister by phone , to be told by a complaining aide : " mr mottaki is having to take quite a lot of calls already as a result of your activities . "
eleven days in , iran had sent london a note of protest , and london had sent one back , apparently offering to de-escalate the row by talking bilaterally , but british officials were agitated .
with no reply back from tehran , they seemed unsure what would happen next .
then , iran 's chief negotiator popped up on british television and signalled that iran wanted bilateral diplomacy .
britain seized on this , hoping iran now wanted to talk , and followed it up with a late night phone call to him from tony blair 's office .
they hoped talks might start soon .
but that was all .
margaret beckett even publicly warned against a swift resolution .
' in the dark ' so when president ahmadinejad 's dramatic announcement came , the british government was it seems , as stunned as everyone else .
the crew said opposing their captors was " not an option " in tehran , british diplomats rushed to the presidential palace , frantically trying to get access .
foreign journalists exchanged a word with the newly pardoned sailors long before the british ambassador was allowed to see them .
the british government was kept firmly out of the loop , as far as one can tell .
the moral of the tale is that the gap between iranian claims and what is really going on may be quite great .
but do not rely on the british government to have the answer .
relations between britain and iran were strained before this crisis and have probably got worse .
there is n't always a conspiracy or a backroom deal .

and no wonder he beamed broadly as they all lined up to shake his hand and offer apologies .
he was the hero in a fairy-tale that had just reached its happy ending , a tale that spoke of his generosity and of iran 's desire for good relations with other nations .
" just a compulsory vacation , " he joked to one of the young sailors , as though they had spent the entire last two weeks playing chess and nibbling pistachio nuts , sitting on red carpets in rooms with floral wall paper - like the scenes in the footage released by iranian tv .
well , now they have got back home we have heard a rather different story .
not so much a fairy-tale .
more of a nightmare .
' mind games ' far from straying into iranian territory , the british crew say they were well within iraqi waters when revolutionary guards rammed their vessels and trained machine guns on them .
in their filmed accounts in iran , crew members praised iranians once arrested , they were blindfolded , their hands tied and lined up against a wall , while they could hear the sound of guns being cocked .
" not exactly a mock execution , " said one officer stoically , but admitted he had never been so scared in his life .
they were kept isolated , in small cells , subjected to aggressive questioning and what they called " mind games " .
they were told to confess on camera , or risk up to seven years in jail .
it sounds as though faye turney had the worst of it .
for four days she thought she was alone , and the others had been sent home .
once they had all recorded tv interviews , conditions improved .
but the footage of them we saw was , they told us , a massive propaganda stunt .
once the filming was over , they were blindfolded and taken back to their cells .
even after they met the president , they were blindfolded and taken under guard to a hotel .
a holiday , compulsory or otherwise , it was not .
quiet diplomacy of course iran now disputes that account , and claims the sailors ' news conference was staged to win propaganda points .
the war of words between the two sides over this saga goes on .
what one can glean about british attempts to solve the crisis is also instructive .
over that two-week period , it went through ups and downs .
mr blair insisted no deal was done to free the 15 navy personnel from the start , the british government seemed confident the incident was premeditated and the british crew had been arrested illegally .
the problem was working out why and persuading iran to hand them back .
at first the foreign office tried quiet diplomacy .
but the extended iranian new year meant many senior iranians were unavailable .
" you ca n't just phone them on your mobile like you can a british minister , " complained one official .
london 's suspicion was that the different power bases in tehran would not work out what to do with them until the holiday was over .
five days in , british patience was wearing thin .
margaret beckett called the iranian foreign minister to warn him britain was giving iran until 1230 on wednesday to act , or it would go public with its evidence and enter - as tony blair put it - " a different phase " .
from quiet diplomacy britain abruptly switched to pulling out the stops .
bilateral ties were frozen .
appeals were made to the un security council and to eu foreign ministers to join britain 's protest .
it was a pretty risky strategy .
iran 's immediate reaction was to drop the idea of releasing faye turney early .
british officials tried to argue that they had never believed the promise anyway .
late-night calls at the un , several countries , including russia , were reluctant to take sides .
the final security council appeal was watered down and did not even demand the captives ' immediate release .
when president ahmadinejad 's dramatic announcement came , the british government was it seems , as stunned as everyone else it did not look good .
by now britain was asking anyone it could think of to ratchet up the pressure .
even syria was asked to help .
even colombia in latin america called in the iranian ambassador .
at one point , apparently , margaret beckett 's office tried to reach the iranian foreign minister by phone , to be told by a complaining aide : " mr mottaki is having to take quite a lot of calls already as a result of your activities . "
eleven days in , iran had sent london a note of protest , and london had sent one back , apparently offering to de-escalate the row by talking bilaterally , but british officials were agitated .
with no reply back from tehran , they seemed unsure what would happen next .
then , iran 's chief negotiator popped up on british television and signalled that iran wanted bilateral diplomacy .
britain seized on this , hoping iran now wanted to talk , and followed it up with a late night phone call to him from tony blair 's office .
they hoped talks might start soon .
but that was all .
margaret beckett even publicly warned against a swift resolution .
' in the dark ' so when president ahmadinejad 's dramatic announcement came , the british government was it seems , as stunned as everyone else .
the crew said opposing their captors was " not an option " in tehran , british diplomats rushed to the presidential palace , frantically trying to get access .
foreign journalists exchanged a word with the newly pardoned sailors long before the british ambassador was allowed to see them .
the british government was kept firmly out of the loop , as far as one can tell .
the moral of the tale is that the gap between iranian claims and what is really going on may be quite great .
but do not rely on the british government to have the answer .
relations between britain and iran were strained before this crisis and have probably got worse .
there is n't always a conspiracy or a backroom deal .
quite often diplomats , like the rest of us , are working in the dark .

i had almost walked right past the low doorway in the souk before i realised .
then i stopped , peered into the gloom , and spotted it - a camel , sporting leather blinkers the size of small searchlights , circling the chamber , a wooden arm linking it to a central stone pillar which rotated as the animal tramped stolidly on .
it was a simple mill for producing sesame oil - and it would hardly have looked out of place at the time of christ .
arabia felix if you want local colour , then go to sanaa .
the entire old city is a unesco world heritage site , complete with tall stuccoed houses whose perforated walls use the winds for natural ventilation .
in a country where almost half the people live on less than two dollars a day , you find your fun where you can there is the small square which covers the site of the 6th-century christian cathedral , though nothing now remains of its ebony and ivory pulpit or its crosses of silver and gold .
in the narrow lanes of the market you are pressed to buy a bag of dull golden crystals and your senses succumb to the smell of burning incense .
to the romans , yemen was , after all , arabia felix , the home of frankincense and myrrh .
they still make novel souvenirs .
venture further , beyond the old city 's 30-foot-high -lrb- 9-metre-high -rrb- clay walls , and there are plenty more reminders that sanaa is one of a kind .
there is the military museum , an eclectic assembly of old weapons -lrb- including a camel-mounted cannon -rrb- , old motor cars , and relics of the british colony in aden .
a chillingly topical touch is an illustration from the 1950s of an execution , the bloodied scimitar still in the swordsman 's hand as the convict expires .
perhaps that explains why the museum is run by part of the interior ministry - the moral guidance department .
sanaa is at least 2,500 years old .
it claims to be the world 's oldest inhabited city , though damascus disputes that .
but it is living on borrowed time .
for once climate change is not the presumed culprit .
it is not natural causes at all - it is human behaviour .
khat crop however you do the sums , they just do not add up .
there are nearly 20 million yemenis - and the population doubles every 17 years .
sanaa is a world heritage site the country imports most of its food , largely because it has too little water to feed itself .
yemenis have about one-fiftieth as much water per head as the world average .
and , to confound confusion , insupportably large amounts of water go on a non-essential crop - khat .
khat in today 's yemen is what smoking was in britain a generation ago .
everywhere you go you find men with cheeks bulging bizarrely as they get their fix .
it is a shrub whose leaves , when you chew them , can induce mild euphoria , excitement , hallucinations and even constipation .
it is increasingly popular in yemen .
while a few years ago men would spend a couple of hours a day on their habit , many now chew happily away for seven or eight hours .
within the last five years or so khat use has become much more accepted among women .
one young professional woman told me she chewed it perhaps once every three months , as a way of socialising .
more often , she said , would be too much .
she blames the drug for what she says is yemenis ' failure to better themselves .
moralising apart , khat is having a baleful effect on yemen .
of the country 's scarce water , 40 % goes on irrigating khat - and khat cultivation is increasing by 10 % to 15 % a year .
you can not blame the farmers .
as one says , growing khat earns him 20 times as much as growing potatoes .
you probably should not blame the chewers either .
in a country where almost half the people live on less than us $ 2 -lrb- £ 1 -rrb- a day , you find your fun where you can .
relocation plans the minister for water and the environment , dr abdulrahman al-eryani , is an agricultural engineer - and he is a worried man .
there are concerns about khat 's effect on yemeni society " the sanaa basin is using water 10 times faster than nature is replenishing it , " he told me .
" and before long there wo n't even be enough to drink .
i am not an optimist .
i think many of the city 's people will simply have to move away .
" the solution i am proposing is a very clear policy - a voluntary one - of reallocating people from here down to the red sea coast .
we could use renewable energy there to desalinate sea water .
and it would be cheaper than trying to provide enough water to sanaa .
" this is not the first time that yemenis have had to move to avoid disaster .
it 's happened many times in the last few thousand years , when nature allowed the population to increase rapidly .
this time , though , there are political frontiers in the way of an exodus . "
the minister , himself a chewer , thinks weaning yemenis off khat will be like breaking the tobacco habit .
" in time it wo n't be cool to chew , " he says .
" but time is what we do n't have . "
one of the ancient arabic names of sanaa translates as the protected city .
it looks as though the protection is running out .

i had almost walked right past the low doorway in the souk before i realised .
then i stopped , peered into the gloom , and spotted it - a camel , sporting leather blinkers the size of small searchlights , circling the chamber , a wooden arm linking it to a central stone pillar which rotated as the animal tramped stolidly on .
it was a simple mill for producing sesame oil - and it would hardly have looked out of place at the time of christ .
arabia felix if you want local colour , then go to sanaa .
the entire old city is a unesco world heritage site , complete with tall stuccoed houses whose perforated walls use the winds for natural ventilation .
in a country where almost half the people live on less than two dollars a day , you find your fun where you can there is the small square which covers the site of the 6th-century christian cathedral , though nothing now remains of its ebony and ivory pulpit or its crosses of silver and gold .
in the narrow lanes of the market you are pressed to buy a bag of dull golden crystals and your senses succumb to the smell of burning incense .
to the romans , yemen was , after all , arabia felix , the home of frankincense and myrrh .
they still make novel souvenirs .
venture further , beyond the old city 's 30-foot-high -lrb- 9-metre-high -rrb- clay walls , and there are plenty more reminders that sanaa is one of a kind .
there is the military museum , an eclectic assembly of old weapons -lrb- including a camel-mounted cannon -rrb- , old motor cars , and relics of the british colony in aden .
a chillingly topical touch is an illustration from the 1950s of an execution , the bloodied scimitar still in the swordsman 's hand as the convict expires .
perhaps that explains why the museum is run by part of the interior ministry - the moral guidance department .
sanaa is at least 2,500 years old .
it claims to be the world 's oldest inhabited city , though damascus disputes that .
but it is living on borrowed time .
for once climate change is not the presumed culprit .
it is not natural causes at all - it is human behaviour .
khat crop however you do the sums , they just do not add up .
there are nearly 20 million yemenis - and the population doubles every 17 years .
sanaa is a world heritage site the country imports most of its food , largely because it has too little water to feed itself .
yemenis have about one-fiftieth as much water per head as the world average .
and , to confound confusion , insupportably large amounts of water go on a non-essential crop - khat .
khat in today 's yemen is what smoking was in britain a generation ago .
everywhere you go you find men with cheeks bulging bizarrely as they get their fix .
it is a shrub whose leaves , when you chew them , can induce mild euphoria , excitement , hallucinations and even constipation .
it is increasingly popular in yemen .
while a few years ago men would spend a couple of hours a day on their habit , many now chew happily away for seven or eight hours .
within the last five years or so khat use has become much more accepted among women .
one young professional woman told me she chewed it perhaps once every three months , as a way of socialising .
more often , she said , would be too much .
she blames the drug for what she says is yemenis ' failure to better themselves .
moralising apart , khat is having a baleful effect on yemen .
of the country 's scarce water , 40 % goes on irrigating khat - and khat cultivation is increasing by 10 % to 15 % a year .
you can not blame the farmers .
as one says , growing khat earns him 20 times as much as growing potatoes .
you probably should not blame the chewers either .
in a country where almost half the people live on less than us $ 2 -lrb- £ 1 -rrb- a day , you find your fun where you can .
relocation plans the minister for water and the environment , dr abdulrahman al-eryani , is an agricultural engineer - and he is a worried man .
there are concerns about khat 's effect on yemeni society " the sanaa basin is using water 10 times faster than nature is replenishing it , " he told me .
" and before long there wo n't even be enough to drink .
i am not an optimist .
i think many of the city 's people will simply have to move away .
" the solution i am proposing is a very clear policy - a voluntary one - of reallocating people from here down to the red sea coast .
we could use renewable energy there to desalinate sea water .
and it would be cheaper than trying to provide enough water to sanaa .
" this is not the first time that yemenis have had to move to avoid disaster .
it 's happened many times in the last few thousand years , when nature allowed the population to increase rapidly .
this time , though , there are political frontiers in the way of an exodus . "
the minister , himself a chewer , thinks weaning yemenis off khat will be like breaking the tobacco habit .
" in time it wo n't be cool to chew , " he says .
" but time is what we do n't have . "
one of the ancient arabic names of sanaa translates as the protected city .
it looks as though the protection is running out .

i had almost walked right past the low doorway in the souk before i realised .
then i stopped , peered into the gloom , and spotted it - a camel , sporting leather blinkers the size of small searchlights , circling the chamber , a wooden arm linking it to a central stone pillar which rotated as the animal tramped stolidly on .
it was a simple mill for producing sesame oil - and it would hardly have looked out of place at the time of christ .
arabia felix if you want local colour , then go to sanaa .
the entire old city is a unesco world heritage site , complete with tall stuccoed houses whose perforated walls use the winds for natural ventilation .
in a country where almost half the people live on less than two dollars a day , you find your fun where you can there is the small square which covers the site of the 6th-century christian cathedral , though nothing now remains of its ebony and ivory pulpit or its crosses of silver and gold .
in the narrow lanes of the market you are pressed to buy a bag of dull golden crystals and your senses succumb to the smell of burning incense .
to the romans , yemen was , after all , arabia felix , the home of frankincense and myrrh .
they still make novel souvenirs .
venture further , beyond the old city 's 30-foot-high -lrb- 9-metre-high -rrb- clay walls , and there are plenty more reminders that sanaa is one of a kind .
there is the military museum , an eclectic assembly of old weapons -lrb- including a camel-mounted cannon -rrb- , old motor cars , and relics of the british colony in aden .
a chillingly topical touch is an illustration from the 1950s of an execution , the bloodied scimitar still in the swordsman 's hand as the convict expires .
perhaps that explains why the museum is run by part of the interior ministry - the moral guidance department .
sanaa is at least 2,500 years old .
it claims to be the world 's oldest inhabited city , though damascus disputes that .
but it is living on borrowed time .
for once climate change is not the presumed culprit .
it is not natural causes at all - it is human behaviour .
khat crop however you do the sums , they just do not add up .
there are nearly 20 million yemenis - and the population doubles every 17 years .
sanaa is a world heritage site the country imports most of its food , largely because it has too little water to feed itself .
yemenis have about one-fiftieth as much water per head as the world average .
and , to confound confusion , insupportably large amounts of water go on a non-essential crop - khat .
khat in today 's yemen is what smoking was in britain a generation ago .
everywhere you go you find men with cheeks bulging bizarrely as they get their fix .
it is a shrub whose leaves , when you chew them , can induce mild euphoria , excitement , hallucinations and even constipation .
it is increasingly popular in yemen .
while a few years ago men would spend a couple of hours a day on their habit , many now chew happily away for seven or eight hours .
within the last five years or so khat use has become much more accepted among women .
one young professional woman told me she chewed it perhaps once every three months , as a way of socialising .
more often , she said , would be too much .
she blames the drug for what she says is yemenis ' failure to better themselves .
moralising apart , khat is having a baleful effect on yemen .
of the country 's scarce water , 40 % goes on irrigating khat - and khat cultivation is increasing by 10 % to 15 % a year .
you can not blame the farmers .
as one says , growing khat earns him 20 times as much as growing potatoes .
you probably should not blame the chewers either .
in a country where almost half the people live on less than us $ 2 -lrb- £ 1 -rrb- a day , you find your fun where you can .
relocation plans the minister for water and the environment , dr abdulrahman al-eryani , is an agricultural engineer - and he is a worried man .
there are concerns about khat 's effect on yemeni society " the sanaa basin is using water 10 times faster than nature is replenishing it , " he told me .
" and before long there wo n't even be enough to drink .
i am not an optimist .
i think many of the city 's people will simply have to move away .
" the solution i am proposing is a very clear policy - a voluntary one - of reallocating people from here down to the red sea coast .
we could use renewable energy there to desalinate sea water .
and it would be cheaper than trying to provide enough water to sanaa .
" this is not the first time that yemenis have had to move to avoid disaster .
it 's happened many times in the last few thousand years , when nature allowed the population to increase rapidly .
this time , though , there are political frontiers in the way of an exodus . "
the minister , himself a chewer , thinks weaning yemenis off khat will be like breaking the tobacco habit .
" in time it wo n't be cool to chew , " he says .
" but time is what we do n't have . "
one of the ancient arabic names of sanaa translates as the protected city .
it looks as though the protection is running out .
