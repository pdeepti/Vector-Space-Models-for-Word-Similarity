to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .
it 's targeting a specific group - western german retirees . in several cities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , some senior citizens walking in shopping areas have had small packets pressed into their hands .
they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .
" it 's simple , " said siegfried gallitschke , a project manager at the city-owned lbw , leipzig 's biggest landlord .
" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "
the project to pull the grey set eastwards came after lbw looked at its tenant rolls , and the big blank spots on them .
the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .
while there has been a net increase in the number of people moving to leipzig since at least 2002 , there have not been enough new arrivals to fill all the vacancies .

" seniors are very flexible , " said gallitschke , who came up with the seniors idea .
" they do n't need jobs , they do n't have children who are in school , and many would like to move to a new city . "
cost of living the big selling point , however , is money .
according to gallitschke , seniors willing to move east can save up to 20 percent on monthly rent .
their living expenses overall are cheaper , he added , and leipzig offers an abundance of affordable cultural activities as well as a surrounding countryside full of lakes - ideal for day trips .
gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .
around 400 seniors have contacted lbw about the campaign and two bus trips set up for july to bring seniors east for a tour of their potential new home have sold out .

" i hope that we will achieve a compromise which should be arrived at easily and that we will not be forced to exercise our veto right , " polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski said during a joint news conference .
invited to the mini-summit , portuguese prime minister jose socrates expressed concern that the eu 's 27-member summit in brussels on thursday and friday could fail .
all of eu requires breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveys shows that a majority of poles would accept the eu reforms as presented " europe needs a compromise , " socrates told reporters .
" a failure would mean that all of us would lose . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier agreed with socrates , saying all eu members would lose out if they ca n't reach a deal at this week 's summit .
" if there is no compromise , no agreement to be reached at the council later this week , everyone will have lost - the european union and each and every member country , " he said .
portugal , which takes over the eu rotating presidency on july 1 , was invited to the bratislava meeting , and socrates indicated he would try to persuade euroskeptic countries like poland to back a breakthrough deal on the eu 's future functioning .
continuing uncertainty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said eu voting reforms would lessen warsaw 's influence agreement on the sorely-needed reform package could end two years of political uncertainty sparked by the failure of the eu 's constitution , which was rejected in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
some observers have said if poland vetoes the reforms that political uncertainty would continue .
poland wants changes to the system of national voting powers at the heart of eu decision-making .
the proposed voting system is skewed in favor of countries with large populations , like germany , according to polish president kaczynski .
" it is not possible that the vote of a citizen in one country may have twice the weight of that from another country , " he said .
" this is very important for the future ; we have to continue with this fight .
" often , in the past , people have fought for things and only history has proved them right , " he said , warning that eu countries should not be split into " good " and " bad " or " obedient " and " disobedient " members .
half-hearted czech support the czech republic is backing poland 's stand and a dutch proposal to boost national parliament 's powers to supervise the eu 's legislative proceedings .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said warsaw had received signals of a possible compromise but told reporters : " i want to say explicitly that for poland to accept the voting system in the european constitution is not a compromise . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said it does n't want to stop the eu but would not agree to a compromise at any price hungary and slovakia support efforts led by germany , the current eu president , to breathe new life into a proposed european constitution which has been on ice since it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
" the slovak government will not support changes which go against the agreements already concluded within the framework of the constitutional treaty , " slovak prime minister robert fico said .
" the eu should stop being preoccupied with itself and turn as soon as possible to issues which are important for everyday society . "
extended talks possible the hungarian and slovak parliaments ratified the now mothballed constitution , along with 16 other member states , while the czech republic and poland indefinitely postponed discussion of the constitution .
germany admitted it realized that despite narrowing differences on some issues , " it 's also clear that there are still some very serious problems to solve , " said government spokesman ulrich wilhelm , who - predicting a hot and drawn-out summit - advised reporters to pack a third shirt as debate could last longer than the two-day summit originally scheduled . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hope that we will achieve a compromise which should be arrived at easily and that we will not be forced to exercise our veto right , " polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski said during a joint news conference .
invited to the mini-summit , portuguese prime minister jose socrates expressed concern that the eu 's 27-member summit in brussels on thursday and friday could fail .
all of eu requires breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveys shows that a majority of poles would accept the eu reforms as presented " europe needs a compromise , " socrates told reporters .
" a failure would mean that all of us would lose . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier agreed with socrates , saying all eu members would lose out if they ca n't reach a deal at this week 's summit .
" if there is no compromise , no agreement to be reached at the council later this week , everyone will have lost - the european union and each and every member country , " he said .

some observers have said if poland vetoes the reforms that political uncertainty would continue .
poland wants changes to the system of national voting powers at the heart of eu decision-making .
the proposed voting system is skewed in favor of countries with large populations , like germany , according to polish president kaczynski .
" it is not possible that the vote of a citizen in one country may have twice the weight of that from another country , " he said .
" this is very important for the future ; we have to continue with this fight .
" often , in the past , people have fought for things and only history has proved them right , " he said , warning that eu countries should not be split into " good " and " bad " or " obedient " and " disobedient " members .
half-hearted czech support the czech republic is backing poland 's stand and a dutch proposal to boost national parliament 's powers to supervise the eu 's legislative proceedings .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said warsaw had received signals of a possible compromise but told reporters : " i want to say explicitly that for poland to accept the voting system in the european constitution is not a compromise . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said it does n't want to stop the eu but would not agree to a compromise at any price hungary and slovakia support efforts led by germany , the current eu president , to breathe new life into a proposed european constitution which has been on ice since it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .

" the eu should stop being preoccupied with itself and turn as soon as possible to issues which are important for everyday society . "

police officers generally no longer face that particular trauma , but those working in berlin might currently experience a bit of second-hand deja vu .

" we 've been running around looking like forest rangers for long enough , " he said , adding that it was time to return to the traditional blue look worn by officers until 1977 .
searching for bargains police department officials meanwhile admit that some precincts may have received a few worn uniforms as donations from other states .

the rarely played piece was performed from 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- above ground this week . musicians johannes denhoff , luciana duta , zazie lewandowski and karl huros of braunschweig 's staatstheater climbed into helicopters and put their instruments to work on sunday to make the performance of contemporary composer karlheinz stockhausen 's " helicopter string quartet " a success .
" when you 're up above in the air , it is truly a feeling of euphoria , " denhoff told german news agency dpa .
" you feel like you 're part of a work of art . "
the " helicopter string quartet " consists of four helicopters and as many musicians .
the participants play from inside the hovering crafts .
the combined sound of the instruments and the helicopters make up the piece , which is part of a 29-hour work called " light cycle . "
audience crucial to success the concert of rotors and strings was broadcast in a hangar from which the helicopters took off .
once the helicopters reached the altitude of 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- and were visible only as small specks in the sky , the hangar doors closed and the audience turned to the four large screens on which they could follow the individual musicians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parity between man and machine ?
the braunschweig performance was only the third successful one ever .
the composer himself set the bar high as to what can be deemed acceptable performance : the helicopters must lift off three times within one day and have a new audience for each round .
all together , around 1,100 people watched the spectacle , according to the organizers .
technical feat " that was an extreme technical challenge , " admitted sound engineer olaf mielke , adding that the performance had been almost perfect , save one minor hiccup .
the piece was put on by the city of braunschweig , which currently holds the title " city of science 2007 , " and a contemporary music festival .

european voters place german chancellor angela merkel first when it comes to taking on a strong leadership role in european union , according to a new study released on tuesday . twenty-eight percent of the electorate in europe believes german chancellor angela merkel should assume a strong leadership role in the european union .
this puts her a long way ahead of other european politicians , according the survey conducted by germany 's bertelsmann foundation in 14 of the eu 's 27 members states .
some 47 percent of the 13,840 persons questioned felt the eu needs politicians capable of providing greater political leadership , while 32 percent said they did not believe there was a leadership deficit .

in france 36 percent of those interviewed hoped she would assume a strong leadership role .
but she scored only 17 percent in germany 's neighbor poland and came bottom with 11 percent in britain , according to the survey which was conducted in may and june .

poland and britain have raised objections to the revised draft that merkel will present to a summit in brussels on june 21-22 , shortly before germany 's term as rotating eu present expires at the end of the month .
poland has threatened to block approval because it objects to the draft 's weighted voting system which it says gives unfair advantage to large countries like germany at warsaw 's expense .

but she scored only 17 percent in germany 's neighbor poland and came bottom with 11 percent in britain , according to the survey which was conducted in may and june .

if eu governments also decide to support the european commission 's proposal as expected , the import , export and sale of cat and dog fur , as well as any products containing their fur , will be banned from 2009 .
" the placing on the market and the import and export ... of fur of cats and dogs and products containing fur shall be prohibited , " according to the draft resolution .
the eu executive proposed the legislation after a public outcry when evidence showed cat and dog fur products were still being traded in the bloc despite a voluntary code of conduct prohibiting the practice .
misleading labels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu said dog fur was sold under other names british labor mep arlene mccarthy , who chairs the internal market and consumer protection committee , said many people unwittingly buy garments made with cat and dog fur due to improper labeling .
" the majority of cat and dog fur comes from china , where over 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their furs and skins , " she said .
" at least 10 dogs are slaughtered to make a single coat - more if puppies are used . "
a 2005 study conducted by the australian animal-rights group humane society international estimated that some 5,400 of the animals killed in china each day .
the european commission said the animals ' fur could be found on the european market in clothing , personal accessories and soft toys for children .
the commission added that by forcing member states to test for the fur , the bloc would be able to put together a clearer picture of what products it is used in .
matching international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bans on trading in cat and dog fur are already in place in other countries the parliament 's support for the ban on dog and cat fur has left green party parliamentarians hoping that similar bans could be introduced to protect other animals as well .
" this ban on the trade in cat and dog fur sets an important precedent and should pave the way for banning the trade in products from other animals on animal welfare grounds - notably seal products , " british green euro-deputy caroline lucas said .
the parliamentarians cut out a proposed loophole that would have allowed the trade of cat and dog fur as long was it did not come from animals bred only for their fur .
" the eu is taking an important step towards ending the cruel and brutal way in which these animals are slaughtered for their fur , " said heide rühle , a german green party member of the eu parliament .
" it is high time that a ban on the trade in cat and dog fur was introduced in the eu , with other countries , like the us and australia , having had bans in place for a number of years . "
fur trade group welcomes the decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote does not outlaw all fur trade the international fur trade federation , an industry association whose members already have a voluntary ban in place , also welcomed the parliament 's decision .
" we hope it will be positive for the legitimate fur trade and complement the voluntary ban on cat and dog furs we have been operating for the last five years , " it said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the commission added that by forcing member states to test for the fur , the bloc would be able to put together a clearer picture of what products it is used in .
matching international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bans on trading in cat and dog fur are already in place in other countries the parliament 's support for the ban on dog and cat fur has left green party parliamentarians hoping that similar bans could be introduced to protect other animals as well .
" this ban on the trade in cat and dog fur sets an important precedent and should pave the way for banning the trade in products from other animals on animal welfare grounds - notably seal products , " british green euro-deputy caroline lucas said .
the parliamentarians cut out a proposed loophole that would have allowed the trade of cat and dog fur as long was it did not come from animals bred only for their fur .
" the eu is taking an important step towards ending the cruel and brutal way in which these animals are slaughtered for their fur , " said heide rühle , a german green party member of the eu parliament .
" it is high time that a ban on the trade in cat and dog fur was introduced in the eu , with other countries , like the us and australia , having had bans in place for a number of years . "
fur trade group welcomes the decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote does not outlaw all fur trade the international fur trade federation , an industry association whose members already have a voluntary ban in place , also welcomed the parliament 's decision .
" we hope it will be positive for the legitimate fur trade and complement the voluntary ban on cat and dog furs we have been operating for the last five years , " it said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

worse still , the west has contributed to the current crisis in the palestinian territories , according to middle east experts . the united states and europe restored direct aid to the palestinians this week in a show of support for president mahmud abbas , who set up an emergency government when his hamas rivals seized power in gaza last week after days of brutal bloodletting .
islamist group hamas however accused the west on tuesday of playing politics with palestinian aid while their gaza bastion remains under israeli blockade .
" by announcing their political and financial support for the palestinian authority , the west is backing an illegitimate government , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said .
eu and us support for the government of prime minister salam fayyad was " an attempt to manipulate the palestinian people and distance it from hamas , " he charged , adding that the strategy would not work .
hamas is not alone in its criticism of the west .
" the international community shares the guilt for the escalation in the middle east , " said udo steinbach , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
hamastan and fatahstan after months of fighting , hamas and fatah had agreed in february to set up a joint government , with saudi arabia acting as a mediator and bringing the two groups together in a symbolic mecca meeting .
meanwhile , the united states backed fatah by providing security training and arms , and israel froze palestinian tax funds for fear that hamas would use the money to finance terror attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian in-fighting pushes peace with israel further into the realm of the unimaginable " by turning against hamas , the united states and israel delegitimated the saudi attempts to mediate , " steinbach said .
the result was politically divided palestinian territories , derisively called " hamastan " and " fatahstan . "
the us has pushed for movement in the israel-palestinian conflict to curry favor with moderate islamic countries , such as syria and jordan , which washington wants as allies against iran 's nuclear ambitions .
at the same time , arab states also use the conflict to further their own foreign policy agendas , with syria and iran presumably supporting hamas with weapons and funding .
but the arab states also pursue differing aims .
" we do n't only have a clash of cultures , but also a conflict between sunnis and shiites within islam , " political scientist christian hacke of the university of bonn pointed out .
germany fails as eu president germany , too - which since january has held the rotating eu presidency - has failed to lead the way .
" the german eu council presidency was weak when it came to middle east policy , " steinbach said .
it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have steienmeier and merkel neglected the middle east ?
currently , the european union appears too busy with its own affairs to shift its focus to the middle east , bogged down as it is by the crisis over a new institutional treaty for the bloc , and , in terms of foreign policy , crippled by changes in government in france and britain .
political vacuum with hamas and fatah fighting , iraq in the midst of civil war , lebanon even more instable than it was a year ago , and iran possibly striving to develop a nuclear bomb , there 's little hope for peace at the moment .
and a route towards an end to conflict in the middle east is unlikely to come from the region itself .

worse still , the west has contributed to the current crisis in the palestinian territories , according to middle east experts . the united states and europe restored direct aid to the palestinians this week in a show of support for president mahmud abbas , who set up an emergency government when his hamas rivals seized power in gaza last week after days of brutal bloodletting .
islamist group hamas however accused the west on tuesday of playing politics with palestinian aid while their gaza bastion remains under israeli blockade .
" by announcing their political and financial support for the palestinian authority , the west is backing an illegitimate government , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said .
eu and us support for the government of prime minister salam fayyad was " an attempt to manipulate the palestinian people and distance it from hamas , " he charged , adding that the strategy would not work .
hamas is not alone in its criticism of the west .
" the international community shares the guilt for the escalation in the middle east , " said udo steinbach , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
hamastan and fatahstan after months of fighting , hamas and fatah had agreed in february to set up a joint government , with saudi arabia acting as a mediator and bringing the two groups together in a symbolic mecca meeting .
meanwhile , the united states backed fatah by providing security training and arms , and israel froze palestinian tax funds for fear that hamas would use the money to finance terror attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian in-fighting pushes peace with israel further into the realm of the unimaginable " by turning against hamas , the united states and israel delegitimated the saudi attempts to mediate , " steinbach said .
the result was politically divided palestinian territories , derisively called " hamastan " and " fatahstan . "
the us has pushed for movement in the israel-palestinian conflict to curry favor with moderate islamic countries , such as syria and jordan , which washington wants as allies against iran 's nuclear ambitions .
at the same time , arab states also use the conflict to further their own foreign policy agendas , with syria and iran presumably supporting hamas with weapons and funding .
but the arab states also pursue differing aims .
" we do n't only have a clash of cultures , but also a conflict between sunnis and shiites within islam , " political scientist christian hacke of the university of bonn pointed out .
germany fails as eu president germany , too - which since january has held the rotating eu presidency - has failed to lead the way .
" the german eu council presidency was weak when it came to middle east policy , " steinbach said .
it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have steienmeier and merkel neglected the middle east ?
currently , the european union appears too busy with its own affairs to shift its focus to the middle east , bogged down as it is by the crisis over a new institutional treaty for the bloc , and , in terms of foreign policy , crippled by changes in government in france and britain .
political vacuum with hamas and fatah fighting , iraq in the midst of civil war , lebanon even more instable than it was a year ago , and iran possibly striving to develop a nuclear bomb , there 's little hope for peace at the moment .
and a route towards an end to conflict in the middle east is unlikely to come from the region itself .
" at the moment , we have a political vacuum of moderate , visionary powers among all parties , " steinbach said .

this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him . " putin is a flawless example of an opponent of freedom of the press and expression , " netzwerk recherche head thomas leif said in his award speech this weekend in hamburg . " when the protection and guarantee of freedom of the press are concerned , putin follows principles closer to those of a dictatorship than of a democracy . " no reaction from russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : say what i want to hear and i 'll be glad to talk with you putin is the first non-german to receive the award which has been given out since 2002 .
the journalists ' organization , however , has not received a reply as to whether putin or russia 's ambassador to germany will be present to accept the award personally , according thomas schuler , a member of the organization 's executive board . there was plenty of reason for the group , which was formed in 2001 , to choose putin to receive this year 's award , schuler said , adding that netzwerk recherche counted 14 journalists who had been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances since putin came to power in 2000 .
none of the murders has been solved . " these murders and cases of journalists being persecuted have created a climate in russia that does not allow for criticism or debate , " schuler said .

this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him .

the deal will see minimum wage protections extended beyond construction workers and building cleaners to another 10 to 12 industrial sectors .
merkel also brokered an agreement on raising mandatory contributions to statutory nursing care , costs which are shared by workers and employers , by 0.25 percent as of july 2008 while lowering unemployment insurance payments by 0.3 percent to 3.9 percent beginning in january . coalition in position to govern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only construction workers and cleaning people were covered by a minimum wage " i think that the coalition has shown that it is capable of solving problems , " christian democratic union parliamentary group leader volker kauder said tuesday . edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , the cdu bavarian sister party , said the compromise represented " a whole series of improvements . " " for us it was clear that there would not be a statutory minimum wage , " stoiber said , adding that the deal reached showed " even when the starting points are very far from each other , the grand coalition can succeed at coming to an outcome . " but members of the spd , who recent polls have shown to be trailing their coalition partners by nearly 10 percent , said the minimum wage deal , for which the social democrats have long pushed and the cdu has bitterly opposed , does not go far enough . debate to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition was not able to reach agreement on ending the post 's letter delivery monopoly " it is in no way a major breakthrough , " spd labor policy expert klaus brander told public broadcaster zdf , adding that a general minimum wage would have been of greater benefit to german workers . spd party head kurt beck said the debate over a minimum wage had not ended , adding that " the political discussion will continue . " germans seem largely in favor of a minimum wage , according to an emnid poll showing that 60 percent of germans were for the idea , with conservative voters also supporting the initiative . the iw cologne research institute said that if a 7.50 euro -lrb- $ 10.00 -rrb- minimum wage were adopted , more than 1 million jobs could be lost to under the table work , meaning less tax income for the government and social security contributions . europe 's largest economy , germany has recently experienced an economic improvement and dropped its unemployment rate from 12 percent in early 2006 to 9.1 percent . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .
it 's targeting a specific group - western german retirees . in several cities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , some senior citizens walking in shopping areas have had small packets pressed into their hands .
they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .
" it 's simple , " said siegfried gallitschke , a project manager at the city-owned lbw , leipzig 's biggest landlord .
" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "
the project to pull the grey set eastwards came after lbw looked at its tenant rolls , and the big blank spots on them .
the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .
while there has been a net increase in the number of people moving to leipzig since at least 2002 , there have not been enough new arrivals to fill all the vacancies .

it could not offer much to young professionals , since jobs in leipzig are in short supply .
the city 's unemployment rate currently stands at 17.1 percent .
it could , however , offer something to seniors , who are ready - even in the autumn of life , for a new adventure .
" seniors are very flexible , " said gallitschke , who came up with the seniors idea .
" they do n't need jobs , they do n't have children who are in school , and many would like to move to a new city . "
cost of living the big selling point , however , is money .
according to gallitschke , seniors willing to move east can save up to 20 percent on monthly rent .
their living expenses overall are cheaper , he added , and leipzig offers an abundance of affordable cultural activities as well as a surrounding countryside full of lakes - ideal for day trips .
gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .
around 400 seniors have contacted lbw about the campaign and two bus trips set up for july to bring seniors east for a tour of their potential new home have sold out .
another is scheduled for september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 20,000 empty apartments in leipzig those interested fall into roughly three groups : there are those who once may have lived in leipzig and want to return to their roots ; others whose children have moved east for work and who want to be close to them ; and a third group of people who no longer have family ties where they live now and are free to do as they please .

the country 's birthrate is one of europe 's lowest , around 1.4 women per child , and the percentage of the population over 65 years of age continues to climb .
demographers from the berlin institute for world population and global development have calculated that by 2020 , between 25 and 36 percent of the population will be older than 60 , depending on region .

to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .
it 's targeting a specific group - western german retirees . in several cities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , some senior citizens walking in shopping areas have had small packets pressed into their hands .
they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .
" it 's simple , " said siegfried gallitschke , a project manager at the city-owned lbw , leipzig 's biggest landlord .
" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "
the project to pull the grey set eastwards came after lbw looked at its tenant rolls , and the big blank spots on them .
the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .
while there has been a net increase in the number of people moving to leipzig since at least 2002 , there have not been enough new arrivals to fill all the vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's city hall so lbw decided to do some targeted marketing .
it could not offer much to young professionals , since jobs in leipzig are in short supply .
the city 's unemployment rate currently stands at 17.1 percent .
it could , however , offer something to seniors , who are ready - even in the autumn of life , for a new adventure .
" seniors are very flexible , " said gallitschke , who came up with the seniors idea .
" they do n't need jobs , they do n't have children who are in school , and many would like to move to a new city . "
cost of living the big selling point , however , is money .
according to gallitschke , seniors willing to move east can save up to 20 percent on monthly rent .
their living expenses overall are cheaper , he added , and leipzig offers an abundance of affordable cultural activities as well as a surrounding countryside full of lakes - ideal for day trips .
gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .
around 400 seniors have contacted lbw about the campaign and two bus trips set up for july to bring seniors east for a tour of their potential new home have sold out .

to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .
it 's targeting a specific group - western german retirees . in several cities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , some senior citizens walking in shopping areas have had small packets pressed into their hands .
they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .
" it 's simple , " said siegfried gallitschke , a project manager at the city-owned lbw , leipzig 's biggest landlord .
" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "
the project to pull the grey set eastwards came after lbw looked at its tenant rolls , and the big blank spots on them .
the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .
while there has been a net increase in the number of people moving to leipzig since at least 2002 , there have not been enough new arrivals to fill all the vacancies .

it could not offer much to young professionals , since jobs in leipzig are in short supply .
the city 's unemployment rate currently stands at 17.1 percent .
it could , however , offer something to seniors , who are ready - even in the autumn of life , for a new adventure .
" seniors are very flexible , " said gallitschke , who came up with the seniors idea .
" they do n't need jobs , they do n't have children who are in school , and many would like to move to a new city . "
cost of living the big selling point , however , is money .
according to gallitschke , seniors willing to move east can save up to 20 percent on monthly rent .
their living expenses overall are cheaper , he added , and leipzig offers an abundance of affordable cultural activities as well as a surrounding countryside full of lakes - ideal for day trips .
gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .
around 400 seniors have contacted lbw about the campaign and two bus trips set up for july to bring seniors east for a tour of their potential new home have sold out .
another is scheduled for september .

to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .
it 's targeting a specific group - western german retirees . in several cities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , some senior citizens walking in shopping areas have had small packets pressed into their hands .
they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .
" it 's simple , " said siegfried gallitschke , a project manager at the city-owned lbw , leipzig 's biggest landlord .
" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "
the project to pull the grey set eastwards came after lbw looked at its tenant rolls , and the big blank spots on them .
the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .
while there has been a net increase in the number of people moving to leipzig since at least 2002 , there have not been enough new arrivals to fill all the vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's city hall so lbw decided to do some targeted marketing .
it could not offer much to young professionals , since jobs in leipzig are in short supply .
the city 's unemployment rate currently stands at 17.1 percent .
it could , however , offer something to seniors , who are ready - even in the autumn of life , for a new adventure .
" seniors are very flexible , " said gallitschke , who came up with the seniors idea .
" they do n't need jobs , they do n't have children who are in school , and many would like to move to a new city . "
cost of living the big selling point , however , is money .
according to gallitschke , seniors willing to move east can save up to 20 percent on monthly rent .
their living expenses overall are cheaper , he added , and leipzig offers an abundance of affordable cultural activities as well as a surrounding countryside full of lakes - ideal for day trips .
gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .
around 400 seniors have contacted lbw about the campaign and two bus trips set up for july to bring seniors east for a tour of their potential new home have sold out .
another is scheduled for september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 20,000 empty apartments in leipzig those interested fall into roughly three groups : there are those who once may have lived in leipzig and want to return to their roots ; others whose children have moved east for work and who want to be close to them ; and a third group of people who no longer have family ties where they live now and are free to do as they please .
" they are n't tied down , " gallitschke said .
" we offer them the room , they design their new freedom . "
purchasing power germany 's population is graying .
the country 's birthrate is one of europe 's lowest , around 1.4 women per child , and the percentage of the population over 65 years of age continues to climb .
demographers from the berlin institute for world population and global development have calculated that by 2020 , between 25 and 36 percent of the population will be older than 60 , depending on region .
" that means you have fewer consumers overall , fewer producers , fewer inventors and so on , " said reinhold klingholz , director of the institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the purchasing power of the senior demographic is getting stronger but lbw prefers to see the silver lining in this silver generation , at least in the short term .
retirees have steady , secure incomes and , with their growing numbers , are a growing force in the economy .
leipzig could profit from the influx of the aged .
" in germany , it 's becoming clearer that the buying power of this group is especially strong , " said lisa neuendorfer , a marketing analyst who specializes in age issues at the research firm ifak .
" for every company that offers a product or a service , it 's a very important group , because it has money . "
not happy not everyone is happy about leipzig 's attempt to tempt seniors into leaving their homes and heading east .
local politicians in the target cities in the west are " reacting kind of strangely , " according to lbm 's gallitschke .
indeed , a spokesman from the city of remscheid told the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he is amazed that leipzig would spend money on a project like this .
" the campaign is n't exactly going to help improve the relationship between the two cities , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hope that we will achieve a compromise which should be arrived at easily and that we will not be forced to exercise our veto right , " polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski said during a joint news conference .
invited to the mini-summit , portuguese prime minister jose socrates expressed concern that the eu 's 27-member summit in brussels on thursday and friday could fail .
all of eu requires breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveys shows that a majority of poles would accept the eu reforms as presented " europe needs a compromise , " socrates told reporters .
" a failure would mean that all of us would lose . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier agreed with socrates , saying all eu members would lose out if they ca n't reach a deal at this week 's summit .
" if there is no compromise , no agreement to be reached at the council later this week , everyone will have lost - the european union and each and every member country , " he said .
portugal , which takes over the eu rotating presidency on july 1 , was invited to the bratislava meeting , and socrates indicated he would try to persuade euroskeptic countries like poland to back a breakthrough deal on the eu 's future functioning .

some observers have said if poland vetoes the reforms that political uncertainty would continue .
poland wants changes to the system of national voting powers at the heart of eu decision-making .
the proposed voting system is skewed in favor of countries with large populations , like germany , according to polish president kaczynski .
" it is not possible that the vote of a citizen in one country may have twice the weight of that from another country , " he said .
" this is very important for the future ; we have to continue with this fight .
" often , in the past , people have fought for things and only history has proved them right , " he said , warning that eu countries should not be split into " good " and " bad " or " obedient " and " disobedient " members .
half-hearted czech support the czech republic is backing poland 's stand and a dutch proposal to boost national parliament 's powers to supervise the eu 's legislative proceedings .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said warsaw had received signals of a possible compromise but told reporters : " i want to say explicitly that for poland to accept the voting system in the european constitution is not a compromise . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said it does n't want to stop the eu but would not agree to a compromise at any price hungary and slovakia support efforts led by germany , the current eu president , to breathe new life into a proposed european constitution which has been on ice since it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
" the slovak government will not support changes which go against the agreements already concluded within the framework of the constitutional treaty , " slovak prime minister robert fico said .
" the eu should stop being preoccupied with itself and turn as soon as possible to issues which are important for everyday society . "
extended talks possible the hungarian and slovak parliaments ratified the now mothballed constitution , along with 16 other member states , while the czech republic and poland indefinitely postponed discussion of the constitution .
germany admitted it realized that despite narrowing differences on some issues , " it 's also clear that there are still some very serious problems to solve , " said government spokesman ulrich wilhelm , who - predicting a hot and drawn-out summit - advised reporters to pack a third shirt as debate could last longer than the two-day summit originally scheduled . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if eu governments also decide to support the european commission 's proposal as expected , the import , export and sale of cat and dog fur , as well as any products containing their fur , will be banned from 2009 .
" the placing on the market and the import and export ... of fur of cats and dogs and products containing fur shall be prohibited , " according to the draft resolution .
the eu executive proposed the legislation after a public outcry when evidence showed cat and dog fur products were still being traded in the bloc despite a voluntary code of conduct prohibiting the practice .
misleading labels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu said dog fur was sold under other names british labor mep arlene mccarthy , who chairs the internal market and consumer protection committee , said many people unwittingly buy garments made with cat and dog fur due to improper labeling .
" the majority of cat and dog fur comes from china , where over 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their furs and skins , " she said .
" at least 10 dogs are slaughtered to make a single coat - more if puppies are used . "
a 2005 study conducted by the australian animal-rights group humane society international estimated that some 5,400 of the animals killed in china each day .
the european commission said the animals ' fur could be found on the european market in clothing , personal accessories and soft toys for children .
the commission added that by forcing member states to test for the fur , the bloc would be able to put together a clearer picture of what products it is used in .
matching international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bans on trading in cat and dog fur are already in place in other countries the parliament 's support for the ban on dog and cat fur has left green party parliamentarians hoping that similar bans could be introduced to protect other animals as well .
" this ban on the trade in cat and dog fur sets an important precedent and should pave the way for banning the trade in products from other animals on animal welfare grounds - notably seal products , " british green euro-deputy caroline lucas said .
the parliamentarians cut out a proposed loophole that would have allowed the trade of cat and dog fur as long was it did not come from animals bred only for their fur .
" the eu is taking an important step towards ending the cruel and brutal way in which these animals are slaughtered for their fur , " said heide rühle , a german green party member of the eu parliament .
" it is high time that a ban on the trade in cat and dog fur was introduced in the eu , with other countries , like the us and australia , having had bans in place for a number of years . "

european voters place german chancellor angela merkel first when it comes to taking on a strong leadership role in european union , according to a new study released on tuesday . twenty-eight percent of the electorate in europe believes german chancellor angela merkel should assume a strong leadership role in the european union .
this puts her a long way ahead of other european politicians , according the survey conducted by germany 's bertelsmann foundation in 14 of the eu 's 27 members states .
some 47 percent of the 13,840 persons questioned felt the eu needs politicians capable of providing greater political leadership , while 32 percent said they did not believe there was a leadership deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose barroso following merkel in terms of popularity was european commission president jose barroso on 20 percent .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy achieved 15 percent , followed by british prime minister designate gordon brown with 14 percent .
home support the german chancellor 's popularity was highest in her native country , where she scored 58 percent .
in france 36 percent of those interviewed hoped she would assume a strong leadership role .
but she scored only 17 percent in germany 's neighbor poland and came bottom with 11 percent in britain , according to the survey which was conducted in may and june .
the chancellor faces a major test later this week when she seeks to persuade eu leaders to agree on a new treaty to replace the bloc 's draft constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
facing opponents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel be able to charm poland 's kaczynski ?
poland and britain have raised objections to the revised draft that merkel will present to a summit in brussels on june 21-22 , shortly before germany 's term as rotating eu present expires at the end of the month .
poland has threatened to block approval because it objects to the draft 's weighted voting system which it says gives unfair advantage to large countries like germany at warsaw 's expense .
britain is opposed to the role of an eu foreign minister mentioned in the draft and is also unhappy about the charter of fundamental rights laying down civic entitlements for all europeans . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

worse still , the west has contributed to the current crisis in the palestinian territories , according to middle east experts . the united states and europe restored direct aid to the palestinians this week in a show of support for president mahmud abbas , who set up an emergency government when his hamas rivals seized power in gaza last week after days of brutal bloodletting .
islamist group hamas however accused the west on tuesday of playing politics with palestinian aid while their gaza bastion remains under israeli blockade .
" by announcing their political and financial support for the palestinian authority , the west is backing an illegitimate government , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said .
eu and us support for the government of prime minister salam fayyad was " an attempt to manipulate the palestinian people and distance it from hamas , " he charged , adding that the strategy would not work .
hamas is not alone in its criticism of the west .
" the international community shares the guilt for the escalation in the middle east , " said udo steinbach , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
hamastan and fatahstan after months of fighting , hamas and fatah had agreed in february to set up a joint government , with saudi arabia acting as a mediator and bringing the two groups together in a symbolic mecca meeting .
meanwhile , the united states backed fatah by providing security training and arms , and israel froze palestinian tax funds for fear that hamas would use the money to finance terror attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian in-fighting pushes peace with israel further into the realm of the unimaginable " by turning against hamas , the united states and israel delegitimated the saudi attempts to mediate , " steinbach said .
the result was politically divided palestinian territories , derisively called " hamastan " and " fatahstan . "
the us has pushed for movement in the israel-palestinian conflict to curry favor with moderate islamic countries , such as syria and jordan , which washington wants as allies against iran 's nuclear ambitions .
at the same time , arab states also use the conflict to further their own foreign policy agendas , with syria and iran presumably supporting hamas with weapons and funding .
but the arab states also pursue differing aims .
" we do n't only have a clash of cultures , but also a conflict between sunnis and shiites within islam , " political scientist christian hacke of the university of bonn pointed out .
germany fails as eu president germany , too - which since january has held the rotating eu presidency - has failed to lead the way .
" the german eu council presidency was weak when it came to middle east policy , " steinbach said .
it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have steienmeier and merkel neglected the middle east ?
currently , the european union appears too busy with its own affairs to shift its focus to the middle east , bogged down as it is by the crisis over a new institutional treaty for the bloc , and , in terms of foreign policy , crippled by changes in government in france and britain .

the investigation centered on at least five officials , including chief executive joachim hunold , and supervisory board head johannes zurnieden , they added .
the insider trading allegations are connected with air berlin 's takeover of rival airline dba last year .
" there is a suspicion that the accused made use of insider knowledge over the planned takeover of a munich-based airline by a berlin-based airline , " the prosecutors ' statement said .
effect on stock price was unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin beat out lufthansa in the dba buyout battle the company officials are suspected of having bought around 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.0 million -rrb- of air berlin shares in june 2006 , shortly after having signed a confidentiality agreement and just before takeover talks began .
hunold and zurnieden are suspected of having bought 1.47 million euros worth of shares alone , the prosecutors said .
hunold , a media-savvy businessman who has led the airline 's rapid expansion , confirmed he was among those named in the inquiry and issued a statement denying the allegations .
" there was no knowing how much or even if the share price of air berlin would rise after the announcement , " he said .
" i first bought shares at the start of june 2006 when a lock-up period imposed on me under stock-exchange rules had expired . "
he said all the purchases had been duly reported to financial regulators and disclosed online .

some 47 percent of the 13,840 persons questioned felt the eu needs politicians capable of providing greater political leadership , while 32 percent said they did not believe there was a leadership deficit .

newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy achieved 15 percent , followed by british prime minister designate gordon brown with 14 percent .
home support the german chancellor 's popularity was highest in her native country , where she scored 58 percent .
in france 36 percent of those interviewed hoped she would assume a strong leadership role .
but she scored only 17 percent in germany 's neighbor poland and came bottom with 11 percent in britain , according to the survey which was conducted in may and june .
the chancellor faces a major test later this week when she seeks to persuade eu leaders to agree on a new treaty to replace the bloc 's draft constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .

poland has threatened to block approval because it objects to the draft 's weighted voting system which it says gives unfair advantage to large countries like germany at warsaw 's expense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 19.06.2007 west shares blame for middle east crisis , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has contributed to the problems in the middle east , some say the eu and the us have failed to resuscitate the middle east peace process .
worse still , the west has contributed to the current crisis in the palestinian territories , according to middle east experts . the united states and europe restored direct aid to the palestinians this week in a show of support for president mahmud abbas , who set up an emergency government when his hamas rivals seized power in gaza last week after days of brutal bloodletting .
islamist group hamas however accused the west on tuesday of playing politics with palestinian aid while their gaza bastion remains under israeli blockade .
" by announcing their political and financial support for the palestinian authority , the west is backing an illegitimate government , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said .
eu and us support for the government of prime minister salam fayyad was " an attempt to manipulate the palestinian people and distance it from hamas , " he charged , adding that the strategy would not work .
hamas is not alone in its criticism of the west .
" the international community shares the guilt for the escalation in the middle east , " said udo steinbach , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
hamastan and fatahstan after months of fighting , hamas and fatah had agreed in february to set up a joint government , with saudi arabia acting as a mediator and bringing the two groups together in a symbolic mecca meeting .
meanwhile , the united states backed fatah by providing security training and arms , and israel froze palestinian tax funds for fear that hamas would use the money to finance terror attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian in-fighting pushes peace with israel further into the realm of the unimaginable " by turning against hamas , the united states and israel delegitimated the saudi attempts to mediate , " steinbach said .
the result was politically divided palestinian territories , derisively called " hamastan " and " fatahstan . "
the us has pushed for movement in the israel-palestinian conflict to curry favor with moderate islamic countries , such as syria and jordan , which washington wants as allies against iran 's nuclear ambitions .
at the same time , arab states also use the conflict to further their own foreign policy agendas , with syria and iran presumably supporting hamas with weapons and funding .
but the arab states also pursue differing aims .
" we do n't only have a clash of cultures , but also a conflict between sunnis and shiites within islam , " political scientist christian hacke of the university of bonn pointed out .
germany fails as eu president germany , too - which since january has held the rotating eu presidency - has failed to lead the way .
" the german eu council presidency was weak when it came to middle east policy , " steinbach said .
it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have steienmeier and merkel neglected the middle east ?
currently , the european union appears too busy with its own affairs to shift its focus to the middle east , bogged down as it is by the crisis over a new institutional treaty for the bloc , and , in terms of foreign policy , crippled by changes in government in france and britain .
political vacuum with hamas and fatah fighting , iraq in the midst of civil war , lebanon even more instable than it was a year ago , and iran possibly striving to develop a nuclear bomb , there 's little hope for peace at the moment .
and a route towards an end to conflict in the middle east is unlikely to come from the region itself .
" at the moment , we have a political vacuum of moderate , visionary powers among all parties , " steinbach said .
" the downward trend in the middle east is far from being brought to a halt , " he added . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

worse still , the west has contributed to the current crisis in the palestinian territories , according to middle east experts . the united states and europe restored direct aid to the palestinians this week in a show of support for president mahmud abbas , who set up an emergency government when his hamas rivals seized power in gaza last week after days of brutal bloodletting .
islamist group hamas however accused the west on tuesday of playing politics with palestinian aid while their gaza bastion remains under israeli blockade .
" by announcing their political and financial support for the palestinian authority , the west is backing an illegitimate government , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said .
eu and us support for the government of prime minister salam fayyad was " an attempt to manipulate the palestinian people and distance it from hamas , " he charged , adding that the strategy would not work .
hamas is not alone in its criticism of the west .
" the international community shares the guilt for the escalation in the middle east , " said udo steinbach , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
hamastan and fatahstan after months of fighting , hamas and fatah had agreed in february to set up a joint government , with saudi arabia acting as a mediator and bringing the two groups together in a symbolic mecca meeting .
meanwhile , the united states backed fatah by providing security training and arms , and israel froze palestinian tax funds for fear that hamas would use the money to finance terror attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian in-fighting pushes peace with israel further into the realm of the unimaginable " by turning against hamas , the united states and israel delegitimated the saudi attempts to mediate , " steinbach said .
the result was politically divided palestinian territories , derisively called " hamastan " and " fatahstan . "
the us has pushed for movement in the israel-palestinian conflict to curry favor with moderate islamic countries , such as syria and jordan , which washington wants as allies against iran 's nuclear ambitions .
at the same time , arab states also use the conflict to further their own foreign policy agendas , with syria and iran presumably supporting hamas with weapons and funding .
but the arab states also pursue differing aims .
" we do n't only have a clash of cultures , but also a conflict between sunnis and shiites within islam , " political scientist christian hacke of the university of bonn pointed out .
germany fails as eu president germany , too - which since january has held the rotating eu presidency - has failed to lead the way .
" the german eu council presidency was weak when it came to middle east policy , " steinbach said .
it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have steienmeier and merkel neglected the middle east ?
currently , the european union appears too busy with its own affairs to shift its focus to the middle east , bogged down as it is by the crisis over a new institutional treaty for the bloc , and , in terms of foreign policy , crippled by changes in government in france and britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 19.06.2007 putin wins journalists ' ' prize ' as press freedom opponent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independent journalists have a hard time getting comments out of russian president putin staying tightlipped can pay off if you 're running for the " closed oyster " trophy - a satirical recognition of the opponents of free press .
this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him . " putin is a flawless example of an opponent of freedom of the press and expression , " netzwerk recherche head thomas leif said in his award speech this weekend in hamburg . " when the protection and guarantee of freedom of the press are concerned , putin follows principles closer to those of a dictatorship than of a democracy . " no reaction from russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : say what i want to hear and i 'll be glad to talk with you putin is the first non-german to receive the award which has been given out since 2002 .
the journalists ' organization , however , has not received a reply as to whether putin or russia 's ambassador to germany will be present to accept the award personally , according thomas schuler , a member of the organization 's executive board . there was plenty of reason for the group , which was formed in 2001 , to choose putin to receive this year 's award , schuler said , adding that netzwerk recherche counted 14 journalists who had been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances since putin came to power in 2000 .
none of the murders has been solved . " these murders and cases of journalists being persecuted have created a climate in russia that does not allow for criticism or debate , " schuler said .
" it 's a climate where self-censorship rules instead of freedom of expression .
netzwerk recherche is of the opinion that putin is responsible for this system . " reporters risking their lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in st. petersburg turned violent with journalists and other civilians being beaten and arrested oleg panfilov , who heads moscow 's center for journalism in extreme situations , also said putin deserved the award , adding that journalists who do not accept the official kremlin line are putting their physical well-being at risk . " independent journalists are constantly under pressure , " panfilov said .
" the reporters who do not let the state tame them are threatened at first , then beat up and sometimes even murdered . " the new york-based committee to protect journalists has named russia the third most dangerous place for reporters to work after iraq and algeria over the last 15 years . independent journalists and news outlets in russia must also spend time and money defending themselves from lawsuits they can not win because the courts side with the government , panfilov said . sign of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the cases of killed journalists , including that of anna politkovskaya , has been solved stephan stuchlik , a moscow television correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he saw just how much pressure reporters in russia are under while covering april opposition demonstrations in st. petersburg . " i got several elbows to the face and kicks in the stomach , " said stuchlik , who was taken into custody for filming the protests .
" i got the impression at the st. petersburg event that the direction was being given by the kremlin .
that it 's not such a big deal if a journalist gets beat up . " stuchlik and members of netzwerk recherche said the decision to give putin the closed oyster award was a german signal of solidarity with the minority of independent russian journalists , who enjoy freedom of expression in theory but not in practice . " freedom of expression in russia is freedom to love putin - and most russians make use of it , " said heribert prantl , editor of the süddeutsche zeitung 's domestic german news . " freedom of expression in russia is the freedom to write what putin wants - and most media make use of it .

european voters place german chancellor angela merkel first when it comes to taking on a strong leadership role in european union , according to a new study released on tuesday . twenty-eight percent of the electorate in europe believes german chancellor angela merkel should assume a strong leadership role in the european union .
this puts her a long way ahead of other european politicians , according the survey conducted by germany 's bertelsmann foundation in 14 of the eu 's 27 members states .
some 47 percent of the 13,840 persons questioned felt the eu needs politicians capable of providing greater political leadership , while 32 percent said they did not believe there was a leadership deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose barroso following merkel in terms of popularity was european commission president jose barroso on 20 percent .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy achieved 15 percent , followed by british prime minister designate gordon brown with 14 percent .
home support the german chancellor 's popularity was highest in her native country , where she scored 58 percent .
in france 36 percent of those interviewed hoped she would assume a strong leadership role .
but she scored only 17 percent in germany 's neighbor poland and came bottom with 11 percent in britain , according to the survey which was conducted in may and june .
the chancellor faces a major test later this week when she seeks to persuade eu leaders to agree on a new treaty to replace the bloc 's draft constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
facing opponents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel be able to charm poland 's kaczynski ?
poland and britain have raised objections to the revised draft that merkel will present to a summit in brussels on june 21-22 , shortly before germany 's term as rotating eu present expires at the end of the month .
poland has threatened to block approval because it objects to the draft 's weighted voting system which it says gives unfair advantage to large countries like germany at warsaw 's expense .
britain is opposed to the role of an eu foreign minister mentioned in the draft and is also unhappy about the charter of fundamental rights laying down civic entitlements for all europeans . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 19.06.2007 putin wins journalists ' ' prize ' as press freedom opponent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independent journalists have a hard time getting comments out of russian president putin staying tightlipped can pay off if you 're running for the " closed oyster " trophy - a satirical recognition of the opponents of free press .
this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him . " putin is a flawless example of an opponent of freedom of the press and expression , " netzwerk recherche head thomas leif said in his award speech this weekend in hamburg . " when the protection and guarantee of freedom of the press are concerned , putin follows principles closer to those of a dictatorship than of a democracy . " no reaction from russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : say what i want to hear and i 'll be glad to talk with you putin is the first non-german to receive the award which has been given out since 2002 .
the journalists ' organization , however , has not received a reply as to whether putin or russia 's ambassador to germany will be present to accept the award personally , according thomas schuler , a member of the organization 's executive board . there was plenty of reason for the group , which was formed in 2001 , to choose putin to receive this year 's award , schuler said , adding that netzwerk recherche counted 14 journalists who had been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances since putin came to power in 2000 .
none of the murders has been solved . " these murders and cases of journalists being persecuted have created a climate in russia that does not allow for criticism or debate , " schuler said .
" it 's a climate where self-censorship rules instead of freedom of expression .
netzwerk recherche is of the opinion that putin is responsible for this system . " reporters risking their lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in st. petersburg turned violent with journalists and other civilians being beaten and arrested oleg panfilov , who heads moscow 's center for journalism in extreme situations , also said putin deserved the award , adding that journalists who do not accept the official kremlin line are putting their physical well-being at risk . " independent journalists are constantly under pressure , " panfilov said .
" the reporters who do not let the state tame them are threatened at first , then beat up and sometimes even murdered . " the new york-based committee to protect journalists has named russia the third most dangerous place for reporters to work after iraq and algeria over the last 15 years . independent journalists and news outlets in russia must also spend time and money defending themselves from lawsuits they can not win because the courts side with the government , panfilov said . sign of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the cases of killed journalists , including that of anna politkovskaya , has been solved stephan stuchlik , a moscow television correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he saw just how much pressure reporters in russia are under while covering april opposition demonstrations in st. petersburg . " i got several elbows to the face and kicks in the stomach , " said stuchlik , who was taken into custody for filming the protests .
" i got the impression at the st. petersburg event that the direction was being given by the kremlin .
that it 's not such a big deal if a journalist gets beat up . " stuchlik and members of netzwerk recherche said the decision to give putin the closed oyster award was a german signal of solidarity with the minority of independent russian journalists , who enjoy freedom of expression in theory but not in practice . " freedom of expression in russia is freedom to love putin - and most russians make use of it , " said heribert prantl , editor of the süddeutsche zeitung 's domestic german news . " freedom of expression in russia is the freedom to write what putin wants - and most media make use of it .

if eu governments also decide to support the european commission 's proposal as expected , the import , export and sale of cat and dog fur , as well as any products containing their fur , will be banned from 2009 .
" the placing on the market and the import and export ... of fur of cats and dogs and products containing fur shall be prohibited , " according to the draft resolution .
the eu executive proposed the legislation after a public outcry when evidence showed cat and dog fur products were still being traded in the bloc despite a voluntary code of conduct prohibiting the practice .
misleading labels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu said dog fur was sold under other names british labor mep arlene mccarthy , who chairs the internal market and consumer protection committee , said many people unwittingly buy garments made with cat and dog fur due to improper labeling .
" the majority of cat and dog fur comes from china , where over 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their furs and skins , " she said .
" at least 10 dogs are slaughtered to make a single coat - more if puppies are used . "
a 2005 study conducted by the australian animal-rights group humane society international estimated that some 5,400 of the animals killed in china each day .
the european commission said the animals ' fur could be found on the european market in clothing , personal accessories and soft toys for children .
the commission added that by forcing member states to test for the fur , the bloc would be able to put together a clearer picture of what products it is used in .
matching international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bans on trading in cat and dog fur are already in place in other countries the parliament 's support for the ban on dog and cat fur has left green party parliamentarians hoping that similar bans could be introduced to protect other animals as well .
" this ban on the trade in cat and dog fur sets an important precedent and should pave the way for banning the trade in products from other animals on animal welfare grounds - notably seal products , " british green euro-deputy caroline lucas said .
the parliamentarians cut out a proposed loophole that would have allowed the trade of cat and dog fur as long was it did not come from animals bred only for their fur .
" the eu is taking an important step towards ending the cruel and brutal way in which these animals are slaughtered for their fur , " said heide rühle , a german green party member of the eu parliament .
" it is high time that a ban on the trade in cat and dog fur was introduced in the eu , with other countries , like the us and australia , having had bans in place for a number of years . "
fur trade group welcomes the decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote does not outlaw all fur trade the international fur trade federation , an industry association whose members already have a voluntary ban in place , also welcomed the parliament 's decision .
" we hope it will be positive for the legitimate fur trade and complement the voluntary ban on cat and dog furs we have been operating for the last five years , " it said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal will see minimum wage protections extended beyond construction workers and building cleaners to another 10 to 12 industrial sectors .
merkel also brokered an agreement on raising mandatory contributions to statutory nursing care , costs which are shared by workers and employers , by 0.25 percent as of july 2008 while lowering unemployment insurance payments by 0.3 percent to 3.9 percent beginning in january . coalition in position to govern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only construction workers and cleaning people were covered by a minimum wage " i think that the coalition has shown that it is capable of solving problems , " christian democratic union parliamentary group leader volker kauder said tuesday . edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , the cdu bavarian sister party , said the compromise represented " a whole series of improvements . " " for us it was clear that there would not be a statutory minimum wage , " stoiber said , adding that the deal reached showed " even when the starting points are very far from each other , the grand coalition can succeed at coming to an outcome . " but members of the spd , who recent polls have shown to be trailing their coalition partners by nearly 10 percent , said the minimum wage deal , for which the social democrats have long pushed and the cdu has bitterly opposed , does not go far enough . debate to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition was not able to reach agreement on ending the post 's letter delivery monopoly " it is in no way a major breakthrough , " spd labor policy expert klaus brander told public broadcaster zdf , adding that a general minimum wage would have been of greater benefit to german workers . spd party head kurt beck said the debate over a minimum wage had not ended , adding that " the political discussion will continue . " germans seem largely in favor of a minimum wage , according to an emnid poll showing that 60 percent of germans were for the idea , with conservative voters also supporting the initiative . the iw cologne research institute said that if a 7.50 euro -lrb- $ 10.00 -rrb- minimum wage were adopted , more than 1 million jobs could be lost to under the table work , meaning less tax income for the government and social security contributions . europe 's largest economy , germany has recently experienced an economic improvement and dropped its unemployment rate from 12 percent in early 2006 to 9.1 percent . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .

they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .
" it 's simple , " said siegfried gallitschke , a project manager at the city-owned lbw , leipzig 's biggest landlord .
" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "

the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .

their living expenses overall are cheaper , he added , and leipzig offers an abundance of affordable cultural activities as well as a surrounding countryside full of lakes - ideal for day trips .
gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .
around 400 seniors have contacted lbw about the campaign and two bus trips set up for july to bring seniors east for a tour of their potential new home have sold out .

to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .
it 's targeting a specific group - western german retirees . in several cities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , some senior citizens walking in shopping areas have had small packets pressed into their hands .
they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .
" it 's simple , " said siegfried gallitschke , a project manager at the city-owned lbw , leipzig 's biggest landlord .
" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "
the project to pull the grey set eastwards came after lbw looked at its tenant rolls , and the big blank spots on them .
the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .
while there has been a net increase in the number of people moving to leipzig since at least 2002 , there have not been enough new arrivals to fill all the vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's city hall so lbw decided to do some targeted marketing .
it could not offer much to young professionals , since jobs in leipzig are in short supply .
the city 's unemployment rate currently stands at 17.1 percent .
it could , however , offer something to seniors , who are ready - even in the autumn of life , for a new adventure .
" seniors are very flexible , " said gallitschke , who came up with the seniors idea .
" they do n't need jobs , they do n't have children who are in school , and many would like to move to a new city . "
cost of living the big selling point , however , is money .
according to gallitschke , seniors willing to move east can save up to 20 percent on monthly rent .
their living expenses overall are cheaper , he added , and leipzig offers an abundance of affordable cultural activities as well as a surrounding countryside full of lakes - ideal for day trips .
gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .
around 400 seniors have contacted lbw about the campaign and two bus trips set up for july to bring seniors east for a tour of their potential new home have sold out .
another is scheduled for september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 20,000 empty apartments in leipzig those interested fall into roughly three groups : there are those who once may have lived in leipzig and want to return to their roots ; others whose children have moved east for work and who want to be close to them ; and a third group of people who no longer have family ties where they live now and are free to do as they please .
" they are n't tied down , " gallitschke said .
" we offer them the room , they design their new freedom . "
purchasing power germany 's population is graying .
the country 's birthrate is one of europe 's lowest , around 1.4 women per child , and the percentage of the population over 65 years of age continues to climb .
demographers from the berlin institute for world population and global development have calculated that by 2020 , between 25 and 36 percent of the population will be older than 60 , depending on region .
" that means you have fewer consumers overall , fewer producers , fewer inventors and so on , " said reinhold klingholz , director of the institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the purchasing power of the senior demographic is getting stronger but lbw prefers to see the silver lining in this silver generation , at least in the short term .
retirees have steady , secure incomes and , with their growing numbers , are a growing force in the economy .
leipzig could profit from the influx of the aged .
" in germany , it 's becoming clearer that the buying power of this group is especially strong , " said lisa neuendorfer , a marketing analyst who specializes in age issues at the research firm ifak .
" for every company that offers a product or a service , it 's a very important group , because it has money . "
not happy not everyone is happy about leipzig 's attempt to tempt seniors into leaving their homes and heading east .

the proposed voting system is skewed in favor of countries with large populations , like germany , according to polish president kaczynski .

this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him . " putin is a flawless example of an opponent of freedom of the press and expression , " netzwerk recherche head thomas leif said in his award speech this weekend in hamburg . " when the protection and guarantee of freedom of the press are concerned , putin follows principles closer to those of a dictatorship than of a democracy .

the journalists ' organization , however , has not received a reply as to whether putin or russia 's ambassador to germany will be present to accept the award personally , according thomas schuler , a member of the organization 's executive board . there was plenty of reason for the group , which was formed in 2001 , to choose putin to receive this year 's award , schuler said , adding that netzwerk recherche counted 14 journalists who had been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances since putin came to power in 2000 .
none of the murders has been solved . " these murders and cases of journalists being persecuted have created a climate in russia that does not allow for criticism or debate , " schuler said .

" independent journalists are constantly under pressure , " panfilov said .
" the reporters who do not let the state tame them are threatened at first , then beat up and sometimes even murdered . " the new york-based committee to protect journalists has named russia the third most dangerous place for reporters to work after iraq and algeria over the last 15 years . independent journalists and news outlets in russia must also spend time and money defending themselves from lawsuits they can not win because the courts side with the government , panfilov said . sign of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the cases of killed journalists , including that of anna politkovskaya , has been solved stephan stuchlik , a moscow television correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he saw just how much pressure reporters in russia are under while covering april opposition demonstrations in st. petersburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 19.06.2007 putin wins journalists ' ' prize ' as press freedom opponent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independent journalists have a hard time getting comments out of russian president putin staying tightlipped can pay off if you 're running for the " closed oyster " trophy - a satirical recognition of the opponents of free press .
this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him . " putin is a flawless example of an opponent of freedom of the press and expression , " netzwerk recherche head thomas leif said in his award speech this weekend in hamburg . " when the protection and guarantee of freedom of the press are concerned , putin follows principles closer to those of a dictatorship than of a democracy . " no reaction from russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : say what i want to hear and i 'll be glad to talk with you putin is the first non-german to receive the award which has been given out since 2002 .
the journalists ' organization , however , has not received a reply as to whether putin or russia 's ambassador to germany will be present to accept the award personally , according thomas schuler , a member of the organization 's executive board . there was plenty of reason for the group , which was formed in 2001 , to choose putin to receive this year 's award , schuler said , adding that netzwerk recherche counted 14 journalists who had been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances since putin came to power in 2000 .
none of the murders has been solved . " these murders and cases of journalists being persecuted have created a climate in russia that does not allow for criticism or debate , " schuler said .
" it 's a climate where self-censorship rules instead of freedom of expression .
netzwerk recherche is of the opinion that putin is responsible for this system . " reporters risking their lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in st. petersburg turned violent with journalists and other civilians being beaten and arrested oleg panfilov , who heads moscow 's center for journalism in extreme situations , also said putin deserved the award , adding that journalists who do not accept the official kremlin line are putting their physical well-being at risk . " independent journalists are constantly under pressure , " panfilov said .
" the reporters who do not let the state tame them are threatened at first , then beat up and sometimes even murdered . " the new york-based committee to protect journalists has named russia the third most dangerous place for reporters to work after iraq and algeria over the last 15 years . independent journalists and news outlets in russia must also spend time and money defending themselves from lawsuits they can not win because the courts side with the government , panfilov said . sign of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the cases of killed journalists , including that of anna politkovskaya , has been solved stephan stuchlik , a moscow television correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he saw just how much pressure reporters in russia are under while covering april opposition demonstrations in st. petersburg . " i got several elbows to the face and kicks in the stomach , " said stuchlik , who was taken into custody for filming the protests .
" i got the impression at the st. petersburg event that the direction was being given by the kremlin .

worse still , the west has contributed to the current crisis in the palestinian territories , according to middle east experts . the united states and europe restored direct aid to the palestinians this week in a show of support for president mahmud abbas , who set up an emergency government when his hamas rivals seized power in gaza last week after days of brutal bloodletting .
islamist group hamas however accused the west on tuesday of playing politics with palestinian aid while their gaza bastion remains under israeli blockade .
" by announcing their political and financial support for the palestinian authority , the west is backing an illegitimate government , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said .
eu and us support for the government of prime minister salam fayyad was " an attempt to manipulate the palestinian people and distance it from hamas , " he charged , adding that the strategy would not work .
hamas is not alone in its criticism of the west .
" the international community shares the guilt for the escalation in the middle east , " said udo steinbach , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
hamastan and fatahstan after months of fighting , hamas and fatah had agreed in february to set up a joint government , with saudi arabia acting as a mediator and bringing the two groups together in a symbolic mecca meeting .
meanwhile , the united states backed fatah by providing security training and arms , and israel froze palestinian tax funds for fear that hamas would use the money to finance terror attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian in-fighting pushes peace with israel further into the realm of the unimaginable " by turning against hamas , the united states and israel delegitimated the saudi attempts to mediate , " steinbach said .
the result was politically divided palestinian territories , derisively called " hamastan " and " fatahstan . "
the us has pushed for movement in the israel-palestinian conflict to curry favor with moderate islamic countries , such as syria and jordan , which washington wants as allies against iran 's nuclear ambitions .
at the same time , arab states also use the conflict to further their own foreign policy agendas , with syria and iran presumably supporting hamas with weapons and funding .
but the arab states also pursue differing aims .
" we do n't only have a clash of cultures , but also a conflict between sunnis and shiites within islam , " political scientist christian hacke of the university of bonn pointed out .
germany fails as eu president germany , too - which since january has held the rotating eu presidency - has failed to lead the way .
" the german eu council presidency was weak when it came to middle east policy , " steinbach said .
it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have steienmeier and merkel neglected the middle east ?
currently , the european union appears too busy with its own affairs to shift its focus to the middle east , bogged down as it is by the crisis over a new institutional treaty for the bloc , and , in terms of foreign policy , crippled by changes in government in france and britain .
political vacuum with hamas and fatah fighting , iraq in the midst of civil war , lebanon even more instable than it was a year ago , and iran possibly striving to develop a nuclear bomb , there 's little hope for peace at the moment .
and a route towards an end to conflict in the middle east is unlikely to come from the region itself .
" at the moment , we have a political vacuum of moderate , visionary powers among all parties , " steinbach said .

worse still , the west has contributed to the current crisis in the palestinian territories , according to middle east experts . the united states and europe restored direct aid to the palestinians this week in a show of support for president mahmud abbas , who set up an emergency government when his hamas rivals seized power in gaza last week after days of brutal bloodletting .
islamist group hamas however accused the west on tuesday of playing politics with palestinian aid while their gaza bastion remains under israeli blockade .
" by announcing their political and financial support for the palestinian authority , the west is backing an illegitimate government , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said .
eu and us support for the government of prime minister salam fayyad was " an attempt to manipulate the palestinian people and distance it from hamas , " he charged , adding that the strategy would not work .
hamas is not alone in its criticism of the west .
" the international community shares the guilt for the escalation in the middle east , " said udo steinbach , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
hamastan and fatahstan after months of fighting , hamas and fatah had agreed in february to set up a joint government , with saudi arabia acting as a mediator and bringing the two groups together in a symbolic mecca meeting .
meanwhile , the united states backed fatah by providing security training and arms , and israel froze palestinian tax funds for fear that hamas would use the money to finance terror attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian in-fighting pushes peace with israel further into the realm of the unimaginable " by turning against hamas , the united states and israel delegitimated the saudi attempts to mediate , " steinbach said .
the result was politically divided palestinian territories , derisively called " hamastan " and " fatahstan . "
the us has pushed for movement in the israel-palestinian conflict to curry favor with moderate islamic countries , such as syria and jordan , which washington wants as allies against iran 's nuclear ambitions .
at the same time , arab states also use the conflict to further their own foreign policy agendas , with syria and iran presumably supporting hamas with weapons and funding .
but the arab states also pursue differing aims .
" we do n't only have a clash of cultures , but also a conflict between sunnis and shiites within islam , " political scientist christian hacke of the university of bonn pointed out .
germany fails as eu president germany , too - which since january has held the rotating eu presidency - has failed to lead the way .
" the german eu council presidency was weak when it came to middle east policy , " steinbach said .
it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have steienmeier and merkel neglected the middle east ?
currently , the european union appears too busy with its own affairs to shift its focus to the middle east , bogged down as it is by the crisis over a new institutional treaty for the bloc , and , in terms of foreign policy , crippled by changes in government in france and britain .
political vacuum with hamas and fatah fighting , iraq in the midst of civil war , lebanon even more instable than it was a year ago , and iran possibly striving to develop a nuclear bomb , there 's little hope for peace at the moment .
and a route towards an end to conflict in the middle east is unlikely to come from the region itself .
" at the moment , we have a political vacuum of moderate , visionary powers among all parties , " steinbach said .

if eu governments also decide to support the european commission 's proposal as expected , the import , export and sale of cat and dog fur , as well as any products containing their fur , will be banned from 2009 .
" the placing on the market and the import and export ... of fur of cats and dogs and products containing fur shall be prohibited , " according to the draft resolution .
the eu executive proposed the legislation after a public outcry when evidence showed cat and dog fur products were still being traded in the bloc despite a voluntary code of conduct prohibiting the practice .
misleading labels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu said dog fur was sold under other names british labor mep arlene mccarthy , who chairs the internal market and consumer protection committee , said many people unwittingly buy garments made with cat and dog fur due to improper labeling .
" the majority of cat and dog fur comes from china , where over 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their furs and skins , " she said .
" at least 10 dogs are slaughtered to make a single coat - more if puppies are used . "
a 2005 study conducted by the australian animal-rights group humane society international estimated that some 5,400 of the animals killed in china each day .
the european commission said the animals ' fur could be found on the european market in clothing , personal accessories and soft toys for children .
the commission added that by forcing member states to test for the fur , the bloc would be able to put together a clearer picture of what products it is used in .
matching international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bans on trading in cat and dog fur are already in place in other countries the parliament 's support for the ban on dog and cat fur has left green party parliamentarians hoping that similar bans could be introduced to protect other animals as well .
" this ban on the trade in cat and dog fur sets an important precedent and should pave the way for banning the trade in products from other animals on animal welfare grounds - notably seal products , " british green euro-deputy caroline lucas said .
the parliamentarians cut out a proposed loophole that would have allowed the trade of cat and dog fur as long was it did not come from animals bred only for their fur .
" the eu is taking an important step towards ending the cruel and brutal way in which these animals are slaughtered for their fur , " said heide rühle , a german green party member of the eu parliament .

european voters place german chancellor angela merkel first when it comes to taking on a strong leadership role in european union , according to a new study released on tuesday . twenty-eight percent of the electorate in europe believes german chancellor angela merkel should assume a strong leadership role in the european union .
this puts her a long way ahead of other european politicians , according the survey conducted by germany 's bertelsmann foundation in 14 of the eu 's 27 members states .
some 47 percent of the 13,840 persons questioned felt the eu needs politicians capable of providing greater political leadership , while 32 percent said they did not believe there was a leadership deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose barroso following merkel in terms of popularity was european commission president jose barroso on 20 percent .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy achieved 15 percent , followed by british prime minister designate gordon brown with 14 percent .
home support the german chancellor 's popularity was highest in her native country , where she scored 58 percent .
in france 36 percent of those interviewed hoped she would assume a strong leadership role .
but she scored only 17 percent in germany 's neighbor poland and came bottom with 11 percent in britain , according to the survey which was conducted in may and june .
the chancellor faces a major test later this week when she seeks to persuade eu leaders to agree on a new treaty to replace the bloc 's draft constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .

poland and britain have raised objections to the revised draft that merkel will present to a summit in brussels on june 21-22 , shortly before germany 's term as rotating eu present expires at the end of the month .
poland has threatened to block approval because it objects to the draft 's weighted voting system which it says gives unfair advantage to large countries like germany at warsaw 's expense .

european voters place german chancellor angela merkel first when it comes to taking on a strong leadership role in european union , according to a new study released on tuesday . twenty-eight percent of the electorate in europe believes german chancellor angela merkel should assume a strong leadership role in the european union .
this puts her a long way ahead of other european politicians , according the survey conducted by germany 's bertelsmann foundation in 14 of the eu 's 27 members states .
some 47 percent of the 13,840 persons questioned felt the eu needs politicians capable of providing greater political leadership , while 32 percent said they did not believe there was a leadership deficit .

newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy achieved 15 percent , followed by british prime minister designate gordon brown with 14 percent .
home support the german chancellor 's popularity was highest in her native country , where she scored 58 percent .
in france 36 percent of those interviewed hoped she would assume a strong leadership role .
but she scored only 17 percent in germany 's neighbor poland and came bottom with 11 percent in britain , according to the survey which was conducted in may and june .
the chancellor faces a major test later this week when she seeks to persuade eu leaders to agree on a new treaty to replace the bloc 's draft constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .

the rarely played piece was performed from 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- above ground this week . musicians johannes denhoff , luciana duta , zazie lewandowski and karl huros of braunschweig 's staatstheater climbed into helicopters and put their instruments to work on sunday to make the performance of contemporary composer karlheinz stockhausen 's " helicopter string quartet " a success .
" when you 're up above in the air , it is truly a feeling of euphoria , " denhoff told german news agency dpa .
" you feel like you 're part of a work of art . "
the " helicopter string quartet " consists of four helicopters and as many musicians .
the participants play from inside the hovering crafts .
the combined sound of the instruments and the helicopters make up the piece , which is part of a 29-hour work called " light cycle . "
audience crucial to success the concert of rotors and strings was broadcast in a hangar from which the helicopters took off .
once the helicopters reached the altitude of 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- and were visible only as small specks in the sky , the hangar doors closed and the audience turned to the four large screens on which they could follow the individual musicians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parity between man and machine ?
the braunschweig performance was only the third successful one ever .
the composer himself set the bar high as to what can be deemed acceptable performance : the helicopters must lift off three times within one day and have a new audience for each round .
all together , around 1,100 people watched the spectacle , according to the organizers .
technical feat " that was an extreme technical challenge , " admitted sound engineer olaf mielke , adding that the performance had been almost perfect , save one minor hiccup .
the piece was put on by the city of braunschweig , which currently holds the title " city of science 2007 , " and a contemporary music festival .
it cost around 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 173,000 -rrb- , 70,000 of which was paid for by the city .

the rarely played piece was performed from 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- above ground this week . musicians johannes denhoff , luciana duta , zazie lewandowski and karl huros of braunschweig 's staatstheater climbed into helicopters and put their instruments to work on sunday to make the performance of contemporary composer karlheinz stockhausen 's " helicopter string quartet " a success .
" when you 're up above in the air , it is truly a feeling of euphoria , " denhoff told german news agency dpa .
" you feel like you 're part of a work of art . "
the " helicopter string quartet " consists of four helicopters and as many musicians .
the participants play from inside the hovering crafts .
the combined sound of the instruments and the helicopters make up the piece , which is part of a 29-hour work called " light cycle . "
audience crucial to success the concert of rotors and strings was broadcast in a hangar from which the helicopters took off .
once the helicopters reached the altitude of 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- and were visible only as small specks in the sky , the hangar doors closed and the audience turned to the four large screens on which they could follow the individual musicians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parity between man and machine ?
the braunschweig performance was only the third successful one ever .
the composer himself set the bar high as to what can be deemed acceptable performance : the helicopters must lift off three times within one day and have a new audience for each round .
all together , around 1,100 people watched the spectacle , according to the organizers .
technical feat " that was an extreme technical challenge , " admitted sound engineer olaf mielke , adding that the performance had been almost perfect , save one minor hiccup .
the piece was put on by the city of braunschweig , which currently holds the title " city of science 2007 , " and a contemporary music festival .
it cost around 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 173,000 -rrb- , 70,000 of which was paid for by the city .

the investigation centered on at least five officials , including chief executive joachim hunold , and supervisory board head johannes zurnieden , they added .
the insider trading allegations are connected with air berlin 's takeover of rival airline dba last year .
" there is a suspicion that the accused made use of insider knowledge over the planned takeover of a munich-based airline by a berlin-based airline , " the prosecutors ' statement said .
effect on stock price was unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin beat out lufthansa in the dba buyout battle the company officials are suspected of having bought around 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.0 million -rrb- of air berlin shares in june 2006 , shortly after having signed a confidentiality agreement and just before takeover talks began .
hunold and zurnieden are suspected of having bought 1.47 million euros worth of shares alone , the prosecutors said .
hunold , a media-savvy businessman who has led the airline 's rapid expansion , confirmed he was among those named in the inquiry and issued a statement denying the allegations .
" there was no knowing how much or even if the share price of air berlin would rise after the announcement , " he said .
" i first bought shares at the start of june 2006 when a lock-up period imposed on me under stock-exchange rules had expired . "
he said all the purchases had been duly reported to financial regulators and disclosed online .
" absurd inquiry " air berlin spokesman peter hauptvogel added that the shares were bought well before air berlin decided to buy dba , a move that sent the berlin airline 's stocks soaring .
hauptvogel , who said searches were also made at the homes of the suspects , described the inquiry as " absurd , " adding that it involved relatively modest sums of money .
air berlin , germany 's second largest airline after lufthansa , acquired dba in august 2006 in a bid to take on flag carrier lufthansa in the fierce battle for domination in the skies above germany . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the most important thing was to convince people that open borders were not something dangerous , schäuble said after a meeting with his czech republic counterpart ivan langer in berlin .
langer said he was convinced that security would not deteriorate after the borders were opened , pointing to improved cooperation between national police forces under the schengen information system .
growing club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border controls can be reimposed for special events such as the g8 summit fifteen countries are currently members of the schengen accord : austria , belgium , denmark , finland , france , germany , iceland , italy , greece , luxembourg , netherlands , norway , portugal , spain and sweden .
all except norway and iceland are european union members .
nine of the 10 countries that joined the eu in its " big bang " expansion in 2004 will be eligible to join at the end of the year .
they are poland , the czech republic , hungary , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania and malta .
cyprus , the 10th country , will not be joining .
nor will romania and bulgaria , which became eu members this year .

the name schengen originates from a small town in luxembourg where seven european union countries signed a treaty to end internal border checkpoints and controls in june 1985 .
more countries joined the treaty over the years .
people within the schengen zone can travel freely from one country to another without internal border controls .

the deal will see minimum wage protections extended beyond construction workers and building cleaners to another 10 to 12 industrial sectors .
merkel also brokered an agreement on raising mandatory contributions to statutory nursing care , costs which are shared by workers and employers , by 0.25 percent as of july 2008 while lowering unemployment insurance payments by 0.3 percent to 3.9 percent beginning in january . coalition in position to govern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only construction workers and cleaning people were covered by a minimum wage " i think that the coalition has shown that it is capable of solving problems , " christian democratic union parliamentary group leader volker kauder said tuesday . edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , the cdu bavarian sister party , said the compromise represented " a whole series of improvements . " " for us it was clear that there would not be a statutory minimum wage , " stoiber said , adding that the deal reached showed " even when the starting points are very far from each other , the grand coalition can succeed at coming to an outcome . " but members of the spd , who recent polls have shown to be trailing their coalition partners by nearly 10 percent , said the minimum wage deal , for which the social democrats have long pushed and the cdu has bitterly opposed , does not go far enough . debate to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition was not able to reach agreement on ending the post 's letter delivery monopoly " it is in no way a major breakthrough , " spd labor policy expert klaus brander told public broadcaster zdf , adding that a general minimum wage would have been of greater benefit to german workers . spd party head kurt beck said the debate over a minimum wage had not ended , adding that " the political discussion will continue . " germans seem largely in favor of a minimum wage , according to an emnid poll showing that 60 percent of germans were for the idea , with conservative voters also supporting the initiative . the iw cologne research institute said that if a 7.50 euro -lrb- $ 10.00 -rrb- minimum wage were adopted , more than 1 million jobs could be lost to under the table work , meaning less tax income for the government and social security contributions . europe 's largest economy , germany has recently experienced an economic improvement and dropped its unemployment rate from 12 percent in early 2006 to 9.1 percent . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 19.06.2007 go east , senior citizen ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are they considering a move to leipzig ?
to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .
it 's targeting a specific group - western german retirees . in several cities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , some senior citizens walking in shopping areas have had small packets pressed into their hands .
they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .
" it 's simple , " said siegfried gallitschke , a project manager at the city-owned lbw , leipzig 's biggest landlord .
" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "
the project to pull the grey set eastwards came after lbw looked at its tenant rolls , and the big blank spots on them .
the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .
while there has been a net increase in the number of people moving to leipzig since at least 2002 , there have not been enough new arrivals to fill all the vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's city hall so lbw decided to do some targeted marketing .
it could not offer much to young professionals , since jobs in leipzig are in short supply .
the city 's unemployment rate currently stands at 17.1 percent .
it could , however , offer something to seniors , who are ready - even in the autumn of life , for a new adventure .
" seniors are very flexible , " said gallitschke , who came up with the seniors idea .
" they do n't need jobs , they do n't have children who are in school , and many would like to move to a new city . "
cost of living the big selling point , however , is money .
according to gallitschke , seniors willing to move east can save up to 20 percent on monthly rent .
their living expenses overall are cheaper , he added , and leipzig offers an abundance of affordable cultural activities as well as a surrounding countryside full of lakes - ideal for day trips .
gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .
around 400 seniors have contacted lbw about the campaign and two bus trips set up for july to bring seniors east for a tour of their potential new home have sold out .
another is scheduled for september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 20,000 empty apartments in leipzig those interested fall into roughly three groups : there are those who once may have lived in leipzig and want to return to their roots ; others whose children have moved east for work and who want to be close to them ; and a third group of people who no longer have family ties where they live now and are free to do as they please .
" they are n't tied down , " gallitschke said .
" we offer them the room , they design their new freedom . "
purchasing power germany 's population is graying .
the country 's birthrate is one of europe 's lowest , around 1.4 women per child , and the percentage of the population over 65 years of age continues to climb .
demographers from the berlin institute for world population and global development have calculated that by 2020 , between 25 and 36 percent of the population will be older than 60 , depending on region .
" that means you have fewer consumers overall , fewer producers , fewer inventors and so on , " said reinhold klingholz , director of the institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the purchasing power of the senior demographic is getting stronger but lbw prefers to see the silver lining in this silver generation , at least in the short term .
retirees have steady , secure incomes and , with their growing numbers , are a growing force in the economy .
leipzig could profit from the influx of the aged .
" in germany , it 's becoming clearer that the buying power of this group is especially strong , " said lisa neuendorfer , a marketing analyst who specializes in age issues at the research firm ifak .
" for every company that offers a product or a service , it 's a very important group , because it has money . "
not happy not everyone is happy about leipzig 's attempt to tempt seniors into leaving their homes and heading east .
local politicians in the target cities in the west are " reacting kind of strangely , " according to lbm 's gallitschke .
indeed , a spokesman from the city of remscheid told the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he is amazed that leipzig would spend money on a project like this .
" the campaign is n't exactly going to help improve the relationship between the two cities , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him . " putin is a flawless example of an opponent of freedom of the press and expression , " netzwerk recherche head thomas leif said in his award speech this weekend in hamburg . " when the protection and guarantee of freedom of the press are concerned , putin follows principles closer to those of a dictatorship than of a democracy .

the journalists ' organization , however , has not received a reply as to whether putin or russia 's ambassador to germany will be present to accept the award personally , according thomas schuler , a member of the organization 's executive board . there was plenty of reason for the group , which was formed in 2001 , to choose putin to receive this year 's award , schuler said , adding that netzwerk recherche counted 14 journalists who had been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances since putin came to power in 2000 .
none of the murders has been solved . " these murders and cases of journalists being persecuted have created a climate in russia that does not allow for criticism or debate , " schuler said .

this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him . " putin is a flawless example of an opponent of freedom of the press and expression , " netzwerk recherche head thomas leif said in his award speech this weekend in hamburg . " when the protection and guarantee of freedom of the press are concerned , putin follows principles closer to those of a dictatorship than of a democracy . " no reaction from russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : say what i want to hear and i 'll be glad to talk with you putin is the first non-german to receive the award which has been given out since 2002 .
the journalists ' organization , however , has not received a reply as to whether putin or russia 's ambassador to germany will be present to accept the award personally , according thomas schuler , a member of the organization 's executive board . there was plenty of reason for the group , which was formed in 2001 , to choose putin to receive this year 's award , schuler said , adding that netzwerk recherche counted 14 journalists who had been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances since putin came to power in 2000 .
none of the murders has been solved . " these murders and cases of journalists being persecuted have created a climate in russia that does not allow for criticism or debate , " schuler said .
" it 's a climate where self-censorship rules instead of freedom of expression .
netzwerk recherche is of the opinion that putin is responsible for this system . " reporters risking their lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in st. petersburg turned violent with journalists and other civilians being beaten and arrested oleg panfilov , who heads moscow 's center for journalism in extreme situations , also said putin deserved the award , adding that journalists who do not accept the official kremlin line are putting their physical well-being at risk . " independent journalists are constantly under pressure , " panfilov said .
" the reporters who do not let the state tame them are threatened at first , then beat up and sometimes even murdered . " the new york-based committee to protect journalists has named russia the third most dangerous place for reporters to work after iraq and algeria over the last 15 years . independent journalists and news outlets in russia must also spend time and money defending themselves from lawsuits they can not win because the courts side with the government , panfilov said . sign of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the cases of killed journalists , including that of anna politkovskaya , has been solved stephan stuchlik , a moscow television correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he saw just how much pressure reporters in russia are under while covering april opposition demonstrations in st. petersburg . " i got several elbows to the face and kicks in the stomach , " said stuchlik , who was taken into custody for filming the protests .
" i got the impression at the st. petersburg event that the direction was being given by the kremlin .
that it 's not such a big deal if a journalist gets beat up . " stuchlik and members of netzwerk recherche said the decision to give putin the closed oyster award was a german signal of solidarity with the minority of independent russian journalists , who enjoy freedom of expression in theory but not in practice . " freedom of expression in russia is freedom to love putin - and most russians make use of it , " said heribert prantl , editor of the süddeutsche zeitung 's domestic german news . " freedom of expression in russia is the freedom to write what putin wants - and most media make use of it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.06.2007 eu parliament votes to ban trading in cat and dog fur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission estimated that 2 million cats and dogs are killed for their fur each year european lawmakers moved tuesday to keep fluffy and fido out of clothing and stuffed kids ' toys by prohibiting the trade in cat and dog fur after a voluntary ban was found to be ineffective . european parliamentarians voted in favor of a proposed ban on the trade in cat and dog fur in the 27-nation bloc .
if eu governments also decide to support the european commission 's proposal as expected , the import , export and sale of cat and dog fur , as well as any products containing their fur , will be banned from 2009 .
" the placing on the market and the import and export ... of fur of cats and dogs and products containing fur shall be prohibited , " according to the draft resolution .
the eu executive proposed the legislation after a public outcry when evidence showed cat and dog fur products were still being traded in the bloc despite a voluntary code of conduct prohibiting the practice .
misleading labels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu said dog fur was sold under other names british labor mep arlene mccarthy , who chairs the internal market and consumer protection committee , said many people unwittingly buy garments made with cat and dog fur due to improper labeling .
" the majority of cat and dog fur comes from china , where over 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their furs and skins , " she said .
" at least 10 dogs are slaughtered to make a single coat - more if puppies are used . "
a 2005 study conducted by the australian animal-rights group humane society international estimated that some 5,400 of the animals killed in china each day .
the european commission said the animals ' fur could be found on the european market in clothing , personal accessories and soft toys for children .
the commission added that by forcing member states to test for the fur , the bloc would be able to put together a clearer picture of what products it is used in .
matching international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bans on trading in cat and dog fur are already in place in other countries the parliament 's support for the ban on dog and cat fur has left green party parliamentarians hoping that similar bans could be introduced to protect other animals as well .
" this ban on the trade in cat and dog fur sets an important precedent and should pave the way for banning the trade in products from other animals on animal welfare grounds - notably seal products , " british green euro-deputy caroline lucas said .
the parliamentarians cut out a proposed loophole that would have allowed the trade of cat and dog fur as long was it did not come from animals bred only for their fur .

if eu governments also decide to support the european commission 's proposal as expected , the import , export and sale of cat and dog fur , as well as any products containing their fur , will be banned from 2009 .
" the placing on the market and the import and export ... of fur of cats and dogs and products containing fur shall be prohibited , " according to the draft resolution .
the eu executive proposed the legislation after a public outcry when evidence showed cat and dog fur products were still being traded in the bloc despite a voluntary code of conduct prohibiting the practice .
misleading labels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu said dog fur was sold under other names british labor mep arlene mccarthy , who chairs the internal market and consumer protection committee , said many people unwittingly buy garments made with cat and dog fur due to improper labeling .
" the majority of cat and dog fur comes from china , where over 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their furs and skins , " she said .
" at least 10 dogs are slaughtered to make a single coat - more if puppies are used . "
a 2005 study conducted by the australian animal-rights group humane society international estimated that some 5,400 of the animals killed in china each day .
the european commission said the animals ' fur could be found on the european market in clothing , personal accessories and soft toys for children .
the commission added that by forcing member states to test for the fur , the bloc would be able to put together a clearer picture of what products it is used in .
matching international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bans on trading in cat and dog fur are already in place in other countries the parliament 's support for the ban on dog and cat fur has left green party parliamentarians hoping that similar bans could be introduced to protect other animals as well .
" this ban on the trade in cat and dog fur sets an important precedent and should pave the way for banning the trade in products from other animals on animal welfare grounds - notably seal products , " british green euro-deputy caroline lucas said .
the parliamentarians cut out a proposed loophole that would have allowed the trade of cat and dog fur as long was it did not come from animals bred only for their fur .

european voters place german chancellor angela merkel first when it comes to taking on a strong leadership role in european union , according to a new study released on tuesday . twenty-eight percent of the electorate in europe believes german chancellor angela merkel should assume a strong leadership role in the european union .
this puts her a long way ahead of other european politicians , according the survey conducted by germany 's bertelsmann foundation in 14 of the eu 's 27 members states .
some 47 percent of the 13,840 persons questioned felt the eu needs politicians capable of providing greater political leadership , while 32 percent said they did not believe there was a leadership deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose barroso following merkel in terms of popularity was european commission president jose barroso on 20 percent .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy achieved 15 percent , followed by british prime minister designate gordon brown with 14 percent .
home support the german chancellor 's popularity was highest in her native country , where she scored 58 percent .
in france 36 percent of those interviewed hoped she would assume a strong leadership role .
but she scored only 17 percent in germany 's neighbor poland and came bottom with 11 percent in britain , according to the survey which was conducted in may and june .
the chancellor faces a major test later this week when she seeks to persuade eu leaders to agree on a new treaty to replace the bloc 's draft constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .

poland and britain have raised objections to the revised draft that merkel will present to a summit in brussels on june 21-22 , shortly before germany 's term as rotating eu present expires at the end of the month .
poland has threatened to block approval because it objects to the draft 's weighted voting system which it says gives unfair advantage to large countries like germany at warsaw 's expense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 19.06.2007 go east , senior citizen ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are they considering a move to leipzig ?
to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .
it 's targeting a specific group - western german retirees . in several cities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , some senior citizens walking in shopping areas have had small packets pressed into their hands .
they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .
" it 's simple , " said siegfried gallitschke , a project manager at the city-owned lbw , leipzig 's biggest landlord .
" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "
the project to pull the grey set eastwards came after lbw looked at its tenant rolls , and the big blank spots on them .
the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .
while there has been a net increase in the number of people moving to leipzig since at least 2002 , there have not been enough new arrivals to fill all the vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's city hall so lbw decided to do some targeted marketing .
it could not offer much to young professionals , since jobs in leipzig are in short supply .
the city 's unemployment rate currently stands at 17.1 percent .
it could , however , offer something to seniors , who are ready - even in the autumn of life , for a new adventure .
" seniors are very flexible , " said gallitschke , who came up with the seniors idea .
" they do n't need jobs , they do n't have children who are in school , and many would like to move to a new city . "
cost of living the big selling point , however , is money .
according to gallitschke , seniors willing to move east can save up to 20 percent on monthly rent .
their living expenses overall are cheaper , he added , and leipzig offers an abundance of affordable cultural activities as well as a surrounding countryside full of lakes - ideal for day trips .
gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .
around 400 seniors have contacted lbw about the campaign and two bus trips set up for july to bring seniors east for a tour of their potential new home have sold out .
another is scheduled for september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 20,000 empty apartments in leipzig those interested fall into roughly three groups : there are those who once may have lived in leipzig and want to return to their roots ; others whose children have moved east for work and who want to be close to them ; and a third group of people who no longer have family ties where they live now and are free to do as they please .
" they are n't tied down , " gallitschke said .
" we offer them the room , they design their new freedom . "
purchasing power germany 's population is graying .
the country 's birthrate is one of europe 's lowest , around 1.4 women per child , and the percentage of the population over 65 years of age continues to climb .
demographers from the berlin institute for world population and global development have calculated that by 2020 , between 25 and 36 percent of the population will be older than 60 , depending on region .
" that means you have fewer consumers overall , fewer producers , fewer inventors and so on , " said reinhold klingholz , director of the institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the purchasing power of the senior demographic is getting stronger but lbw prefers to see the silver lining in this silver generation , at least in the short term .
retirees have steady , secure incomes and , with their growing numbers , are a growing force in the economy .
leipzig could profit from the influx of the aged .
" in germany , it 's becoming clearer that the buying power of this group is especially strong , " said lisa neuendorfer , a marketing analyst who specializes in age issues at the research firm ifak .
" for every company that offers a product or a service , it 's a very important group , because it has money . "
not happy not everyone is happy about leipzig 's attempt to tempt seniors into leaving their homes and heading east .
local politicians in the target cities in the west are " reacting kind of strangely , " according to lbm 's gallitschke .
indeed , a spokesman from the city of remscheid told the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he is amazed that leipzig would spend money on a project like this .
" the campaign is n't exactly going to help improve the relationship between the two cities , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 19.06.2007 go east , senior citizen ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are they considering a move to leipzig ?
to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .
it 's targeting a specific group - western german retirees . in several cities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , some senior citizens walking in shopping areas have had small packets pressed into their hands .
they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .
" it 's simple , " said siegfried gallitschke , a project manager at the city-owned lbw , leipzig 's biggest landlord .
" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "
the project to pull the grey set eastwards came after lbw looked at its tenant rolls , and the big blank spots on them .
the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .
while there has been a net increase in the number of people moving to leipzig since at least 2002 , there have not been enough new arrivals to fill all the vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's city hall so lbw decided to do some targeted marketing .
it could not offer much to young professionals , since jobs in leipzig are in short supply .
the city 's unemployment rate currently stands at 17.1 percent .
it could , however , offer something to seniors , who are ready - even in the autumn of life , for a new adventure .
" seniors are very flexible , " said gallitschke , who came up with the seniors idea .
" they do n't need jobs , they do n't have children who are in school , and many would like to move to a new city . "
cost of living the big selling point , however , is money .
according to gallitschke , seniors willing to move east can save up to 20 percent on monthly rent .
their living expenses overall are cheaper , he added , and leipzig offers an abundance of affordable cultural activities as well as a surrounding countryside full of lakes - ideal for day trips .
gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .
around 400 seniors have contacted lbw about the campaign and two bus trips set up for july to bring seniors east for a tour of their potential new home have sold out .
another is scheduled for september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 20,000 empty apartments in leipzig those interested fall into roughly three groups : there are those who once may have lived in leipzig and want to return to their roots ; others whose children have moved east for work and who want to be close to them ; and a third group of people who no longer have family ties where they live now and are free to do as they please .
" they are n't tied down , " gallitschke said .
" we offer them the room , they design their new freedom . "
purchasing power germany 's population is graying .
the country 's birthrate is one of europe 's lowest , around 1.4 women per child , and the percentage of the population over 65 years of age continues to climb .
demographers from the berlin institute for world population and global development have calculated that by 2020 , between 25 and 36 percent of the population will be older than 60 , depending on region .
" that means you have fewer consumers overall , fewer producers , fewer inventors and so on , " said reinhold klingholz , director of the institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the purchasing power of the senior demographic is getting stronger but lbw prefers to see the silver lining in this silver generation , at least in the short term .
retirees have steady , secure incomes and , with their growing numbers , are a growing force in the economy .
leipzig could profit from the influx of the aged .
" in germany , it 's becoming clearer that the buying power of this group is especially strong , " said lisa neuendorfer , a marketing analyst who specializes in age issues at the research firm ifak .
" for every company that offers a product or a service , it 's a very important group , because it has money . "
not happy not everyone is happy about leipzig 's attempt to tempt seniors into leaving their homes and heading east .
local politicians in the target cities in the west are " reacting kind of strangely , " according to lbm 's gallitschke .
indeed , a spokesman from the city of remscheid told the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he is amazed that leipzig would spend money on a project like this .
" the campaign is n't exactly going to help improve the relationship between the two cities , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rarely played piece was performed from 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- above ground this week . musicians johannes denhoff , luciana duta , zazie lewandowski and karl huros of braunschweig 's staatstheater climbed into helicopters and put their instruments to work on sunday to make the performance of contemporary composer karlheinz stockhausen 's " helicopter string quartet " a success .
" when you 're up above in the air , it is truly a feeling of euphoria , " denhoff told german news agency dpa .
" you feel like you 're part of a work of art . "
the " helicopter string quartet " consists of four helicopters and as many musicians .
the participants play from inside the hovering crafts .
the combined sound of the instruments and the helicopters make up the piece , which is part of a 29-hour work called " light cycle . "
audience crucial to success the concert of rotors and strings was broadcast in a hangar from which the helicopters took off .
once the helicopters reached the altitude of 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- and were visible only as small specks in the sky , the hangar doors closed and the audience turned to the four large screens on which they could follow the individual musicians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parity between man and machine ?
the braunschweig performance was only the third successful one ever .
the composer himself set the bar high as to what can be deemed acceptable performance : the helicopters must lift off three times within one day and have a new audience for each round .
all together , around 1,100 people watched the spectacle , according to the organizers .
technical feat " that was an extreme technical challenge , " admitted sound engineer olaf mielke , adding that the performance had been almost perfect , save one minor hiccup .
the piece was put on by the city of braunschweig , which currently holds the title " city of science 2007 , " and a contemporary music festival .
it cost around 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 173,000 -rrb- , 70,000 of which was paid for by the city .
the " helicopter string quartet " was previously played in amsterdam , in 1995 , and salzburg , in 2003 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

worse still , the west has contributed to the current crisis in the palestinian territories , according to middle east experts . the united states and europe restored direct aid to the palestinians this week in a show of support for president mahmud abbas , who set up an emergency government when his hamas rivals seized power in gaza last week after days of brutal bloodletting .
islamist group hamas however accused the west on tuesday of playing politics with palestinian aid while their gaza bastion remains under israeli blockade .
" by announcing their political and financial support for the palestinian authority , the west is backing an illegitimate government , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said .
eu and us support for the government of prime minister salam fayyad was " an attempt to manipulate the palestinian people and distance it from hamas , " he charged , adding that the strategy would not work .
hamas is not alone in its criticism of the west .
" the international community shares the guilt for the escalation in the middle east , " said udo steinbach , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
hamastan and fatahstan after months of fighting , hamas and fatah had agreed in february to set up a joint government , with saudi arabia acting as a mediator and bringing the two groups together in a symbolic mecca meeting .
meanwhile , the united states backed fatah by providing security training and arms , and israel froze palestinian tax funds for fear that hamas would use the money to finance terror attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian in-fighting pushes peace with israel further into the realm of the unimaginable " by turning against hamas , the united states and israel delegitimated the saudi attempts to mediate , " steinbach said .
the result was politically divided palestinian territories , derisively called " hamastan " and " fatahstan . "
the us has pushed for movement in the israel-palestinian conflict to curry favor with moderate islamic countries , such as syria and jordan , which washington wants as allies against iran 's nuclear ambitions .
at the same time , arab states also use the conflict to further their own foreign policy agendas , with syria and iran presumably supporting hamas with weapons and funding .
but the arab states also pursue differing aims .
" we do n't only have a clash of cultures , but also a conflict between sunnis and shiites within islam , " political scientist christian hacke of the university of bonn pointed out .
germany fails as eu president germany , too - which since january has held the rotating eu presidency - has failed to lead the way .
" the german eu council presidency was weak when it came to middle east policy , " steinbach said .
it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have steienmeier and merkel neglected the middle east ?
currently , the european union appears too busy with its own affairs to shift its focus to the middle east , bogged down as it is by the crisis over a new institutional treaty for the bloc , and , in terms of foreign policy , crippled by changes in government in france and britain .
political vacuum with hamas and fatah fighting , iraq in the midst of civil war , lebanon even more instable than it was a year ago , and iran possibly striving to develop a nuclear bomb , there 's little hope for peace at the moment .
and a route towards an end to conflict in the middle east is unlikely to come from the region itself .

it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have steienmeier and merkel neglected the middle east ?
currently , the european union appears too busy with its own affairs to shift its focus to the middle east , bogged down as it is by the crisis over a new institutional treaty for the bloc , and , in terms of foreign policy , crippled by changes in government in france and britain .
political vacuum with hamas and fatah fighting , iraq in the midst of civil war , lebanon even more instable than it was a year ago , and iran possibly striving to develop a nuclear bomb , there 's little hope for peace at the moment .
and a route towards an end to conflict in the middle east is unlikely to come from the region itself .
" at the moment , we have a political vacuum of moderate , visionary powers among all parties , " steinbach said .
" the downward trend in the middle east is far from being brought to a halt , " he added . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

worse still , the west has contributed to the current crisis in the palestinian territories , according to middle east experts . the united states and europe restored direct aid to the palestinians this week in a show of support for president mahmud abbas , who set up an emergency government when his hamas rivals seized power in gaza last week after days of brutal bloodletting .
islamist group hamas however accused the west on tuesday of playing politics with palestinian aid while their gaza bastion remains under israeli blockade .
" by announcing their political and financial support for the palestinian authority , the west is backing an illegitimate government , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said .
eu and us support for the government of prime minister salam fayyad was " an attempt to manipulate the palestinian people and distance it from hamas , " he charged , adding that the strategy would not work .
hamas is not alone in its criticism of the west .
" the international community shares the guilt for the escalation in the middle east , " said udo steinbach , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
hamastan and fatahstan after months of fighting , hamas and fatah had agreed in february to set up a joint government , with saudi arabia acting as a mediator and bringing the two groups together in a symbolic mecca meeting .
meanwhile , the united states backed fatah by providing security training and arms , and israel froze palestinian tax funds for fear that hamas would use the money to finance terror attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian in-fighting pushes peace with israel further into the realm of the unimaginable " by turning against hamas , the united states and israel delegitimated the saudi attempts to mediate , " steinbach said .
the result was politically divided palestinian territories , derisively called " hamastan " and " fatahstan . "
the us has pushed for movement in the israel-palestinian conflict to curry favor with moderate islamic countries , such as syria and jordan , which washington wants as allies against iran 's nuclear ambitions .
at the same time , arab states also use the conflict to further their own foreign policy agendas , with syria and iran presumably supporting hamas with weapons and funding .
but the arab states also pursue differing aims .
" we do n't only have a clash of cultures , but also a conflict between sunnis and shiites within islam , " political scientist christian hacke of the university of bonn pointed out .
germany fails as eu president germany , too - which since january has held the rotating eu presidency - has failed to lead the way .
" the german eu council presidency was weak when it came to middle east policy , " steinbach said .
it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have steienmeier and merkel neglected the middle east ?
currently , the european union appears too busy with its own affairs to shift its focus to the middle east , bogged down as it is by the crisis over a new institutional treaty for the bloc , and , in terms of foreign policy , crippled by changes in government in france and britain .
political vacuum with hamas and fatah fighting , iraq in the midst of civil war , lebanon even more instable than it was a year ago , and iran possibly striving to develop a nuclear bomb , there 's little hope for peace at the moment .
and a route towards an end to conflict in the middle east is unlikely to come from the region itself .
" at the moment , we have a political vacuum of moderate , visionary powers among all parties , " steinbach said .
" the downward trend in the middle east is far from being brought to a halt , " he added . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european voters place german chancellor angela merkel first when it comes to taking on a strong leadership role in european union , according to a new study released on tuesday . twenty-eight percent of the electorate in europe believes german chancellor angela merkel should assume a strong leadership role in the european union .
this puts her a long way ahead of other european politicians , according the survey conducted by germany 's bertelsmann foundation in 14 of the eu 's 27 members states .
some 47 percent of the 13,840 persons questioned felt the eu needs politicians capable of providing greater political leadership , while 32 percent said they did not believe there was a leadership deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose barroso following merkel in terms of popularity was european commission president jose barroso on 20 percent .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy achieved 15 percent , followed by british prime minister designate gordon brown with 14 percent .
home support the german chancellor 's popularity was highest in her native country , where she scored 58 percent .
in france 36 percent of those interviewed hoped she would assume a strong leadership role .
but she scored only 17 percent in germany 's neighbor poland and came bottom with 11 percent in britain , according to the survey which was conducted in may and june .
the chancellor faces a major test later this week when she seeks to persuade eu leaders to agree on a new treaty to replace the bloc 's draft constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
facing opponents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel be able to charm poland 's kaczynski ?
poland and britain have raised objections to the revised draft that merkel will present to a summit in brussels on june 21-22 , shortly before germany 's term as rotating eu present expires at the end of the month .
poland has threatened to block approval because it objects to the draft 's weighted voting system which it says gives unfair advantage to large countries like germany at warsaw 's expense .
britain is opposed to the role of an eu foreign minister mentioned in the draft and is also unhappy about the charter of fundamental rights laying down civic entitlements for all europeans . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal will see minimum wage protections extended beyond construction workers and building cleaners to another 10 to 12 industrial sectors .
merkel also brokered an agreement on raising mandatory contributions to statutory nursing care , costs which are shared by workers and employers , by 0.25 percent as of july 2008 while lowering unemployment insurance payments by 0.3 percent to 3.9 percent beginning in january . coalition in position to govern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only construction workers and cleaning people were covered by a minimum wage " i think that the coalition has shown that it is capable of solving problems , " christian democratic union parliamentary group leader volker kauder said tuesday . edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , the cdu bavarian sister party , said the compromise represented " a whole series of improvements . " " for us it was clear that there would not be a statutory minimum wage , " stoiber said , adding that the deal reached showed " even when the starting points are very far from each other , the grand coalition can succeed at coming to an outcome . " but members of the spd , who recent polls have shown to be trailing their coalition partners by nearly 10 percent , said the minimum wage deal , for which the social democrats have long pushed and the cdu has bitterly opposed , does not go far enough . debate to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition was not able to reach agreement on ending the post 's letter delivery monopoly " it is in no way a major breakthrough , " spd labor policy expert klaus brander told public broadcaster zdf , adding that a general minimum wage would have been of greater benefit to german workers . spd party head kurt beck said the debate over a minimum wage had not ended , adding that " the political discussion will continue . " germans seem largely in favor of a minimum wage , according to an emnid poll showing that 60 percent of germans were for the idea , with conservative voters also supporting the initiative . the iw cologne research institute said that if a 7.50 euro -lrb- $ 10.00 -rrb- minimum wage were adopted , more than 1 million jobs could be lost to under the table work , meaning less tax income for the government and social security contributions . europe 's largest economy , germany has recently experienced an economic improvement and dropped its unemployment rate from 12 percent in early 2006 to 9.1 percent . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 19.06.2007 putin wins journalists ' ' prize ' as press freedom opponent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independent journalists have a hard time getting comments out of russian president putin staying tightlipped can pay off if you 're running for the " closed oyster " trophy - a satirical recognition of the opponents of free press .
this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him . " putin is a flawless example of an opponent of freedom of the press and expression , " netzwerk recherche head thomas leif said in his award speech this weekend in hamburg . " when the protection and guarantee of freedom of the press are concerned , putin follows principles closer to those of a dictatorship than of a democracy . " no reaction from russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : say what i want to hear and i 'll be glad to talk with you putin is the first non-german to receive the award which has been given out since 2002 .
the journalists ' organization , however , has not received a reply as to whether putin or russia 's ambassador to germany will be present to accept the award personally , according thomas schuler , a member of the organization 's executive board . there was plenty of reason for the group , which was formed in 2001 , to choose putin to receive this year 's award , schuler said , adding that netzwerk recherche counted 14 journalists who had been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances since putin came to power in 2000 .
none of the murders has been solved . " these murders and cases of journalists being persecuted have created a climate in russia that does not allow for criticism or debate , " schuler said .
" it 's a climate where self-censorship rules instead of freedom of expression .
netzwerk recherche is of the opinion that putin is responsible for this system . " reporters risking their lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in st. petersburg turned violent with journalists and other civilians being beaten and arrested oleg panfilov , who heads moscow 's center for journalism in extreme situations , also said putin deserved the award , adding that journalists who do not accept the official kremlin line are putting their physical well-being at risk . " independent journalists are constantly under pressure , " panfilov said .
" the reporters who do not let the state tame them are threatened at first , then beat up and sometimes even murdered . " the new york-based committee to protect journalists has named russia the third most dangerous place for reporters to work after iraq and algeria over the last 15 years . independent journalists and news outlets in russia must also spend time and money defending themselves from lawsuits they can not win because the courts side with the government , panfilov said . sign of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the cases of killed journalists , including that of anna politkovskaya , has been solved stephan stuchlik , a moscow television correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he saw just how much pressure reporters in russia are under while covering april opposition demonstrations in st. petersburg . " i got several elbows to the face and kicks in the stomach , " said stuchlik , who was taken into custody for filming the protests .
" i got the impression at the st. petersburg event that the direction was being given by the kremlin .
that it 's not such a big deal if a journalist gets beat up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 19.06.2007 putin wins journalists ' ' prize ' as press freedom opponent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independent journalists have a hard time getting comments out of russian president putin staying tightlipped can pay off if you 're running for the " closed oyster " trophy - a satirical recognition of the opponents of free press .
this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him . " putin is a flawless example of an opponent of freedom of the press and expression , " netzwerk recherche head thomas leif said in his award speech this weekend in hamburg . " when the protection and guarantee of freedom of the press are concerned , putin follows principles closer to those of a dictatorship than of a democracy . " no reaction from russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : say what i want to hear and i 'll be glad to talk with you putin is the first non-german to receive the award which has been given out since 2002 .
the journalists ' organization , however , has not received a reply as to whether putin or russia 's ambassador to germany will be present to accept the award personally , according thomas schuler , a member of the organization 's executive board . there was plenty of reason for the group , which was formed in 2001 , to choose putin to receive this year 's award , schuler said , adding that netzwerk recherche counted 14 journalists who had been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances since putin came to power in 2000 .
none of the murders has been solved . " these murders and cases of journalists being persecuted have created a climate in russia that does not allow for criticism or debate , " schuler said .
" it 's a climate where self-censorship rules instead of freedom of expression .
netzwerk recherche is of the opinion that putin is responsible for this system . " reporters risking their lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in st. petersburg turned violent with journalists and other civilians being beaten and arrested oleg panfilov , who heads moscow 's center for journalism in extreme situations , also said putin deserved the award , adding that journalists who do not accept the official kremlin line are putting their physical well-being at risk . " independent journalists are constantly under pressure , " panfilov said .
" the reporters who do not let the state tame them are threatened at first , then beat up and sometimes even murdered . " the new york-based committee to protect journalists has named russia the third most dangerous place for reporters to work after iraq and algeria over the last 15 years . independent journalists and news outlets in russia must also spend time and money defending themselves from lawsuits they can not win because the courts side with the government , panfilov said . sign of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the cases of killed journalists , including that of anna politkovskaya , has been solved stephan stuchlik , a moscow television correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he saw just how much pressure reporters in russia are under while covering april opposition demonstrations in st. petersburg . " i got several elbows to the face and kicks in the stomach , " said stuchlik , who was taken into custody for filming the protests .
" i got the impression at the st. petersburg event that the direction was being given by the kremlin .
that it 's not such a big deal if a journalist gets beat up . " stuchlik and members of netzwerk recherche said the decision to give putin the closed oyster award was a german signal of solidarity with the minority of independent russian journalists , who enjoy freedom of expression in theory but not in practice . " freedom of expression in russia is freedom to love putin - and most russians make use of it , " said heribert prantl , editor of the süddeutsche zeitung 's domestic german news .

the rarely played piece was performed from 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- above ground this week . musicians johannes denhoff , luciana duta , zazie lewandowski and karl huros of braunschweig 's staatstheater climbed into helicopters and put their instruments to work on sunday to make the performance of contemporary composer karlheinz stockhausen 's " helicopter string quartet " a success .
" when you 're up above in the air , it is truly a feeling of euphoria , " denhoff told german news agency dpa .
" you feel like you 're part of a work of art . "
the " helicopter string quartet " consists of four helicopters and as many musicians .
the participants play from inside the hovering crafts .
the combined sound of the instruments and the helicopters make up the piece , which is part of a 29-hour work called " light cycle . "
audience crucial to success the concert of rotors and strings was broadcast in a hangar from which the helicopters took off .
once the helicopters reached the altitude of 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- and were visible only as small specks in the sky , the hangar doors closed and the audience turned to the four large screens on which they could follow the individual musicians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parity between man and machine ?
the braunschweig performance was only the third successful one ever .
the composer himself set the bar high as to what can be deemed acceptable performance : the helicopters must lift off three times within one day and have a new audience for each round .
all together , around 1,100 people watched the spectacle , according to the organizers .
technical feat " that was an extreme technical challenge , " admitted sound engineer olaf mielke , adding that the performance had been almost perfect , save one minor hiccup .
the piece was put on by the city of braunschweig , which currently holds the title " city of science 2007 , " and a contemporary music festival .
it cost around 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 173,000 -rrb- , 70,000 of which was paid for by the city .

worse still , the west has contributed to the current crisis in the palestinian territories , according to middle east experts . the united states and europe restored direct aid to the palestinians this week in a show of support for president mahmud abbas , who set up an emergency government when his hamas rivals seized power in gaza last week after days of brutal bloodletting .
islamist group hamas however accused the west on tuesday of playing politics with palestinian aid while their gaza bastion remains under israeli blockade .
" by announcing their political and financial support for the palestinian authority , the west is backing an illegitimate government , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said .
eu and us support for the government of prime minister salam fayyad was " an attempt to manipulate the palestinian people and distance it from hamas , " he charged , adding that the strategy would not work .
hamas is not alone in its criticism of the west .
" the international community shares the guilt for the escalation in the middle east , " said udo steinbach , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
hamastan and fatahstan after months of fighting , hamas and fatah had agreed in february to set up a joint government , with saudi arabia acting as a mediator and bringing the two groups together in a symbolic mecca meeting .
meanwhile , the united states backed fatah by providing security training and arms , and israel froze palestinian tax funds for fear that hamas would use the money to finance terror attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian in-fighting pushes peace with israel further into the realm of the unimaginable " by turning against hamas , the united states and israel delegitimated the saudi attempts to mediate , " steinbach said .
the result was politically divided palestinian territories , derisively called " hamastan " and " fatahstan . "
the us has pushed for movement in the israel-palestinian conflict to curry favor with moderate islamic countries , such as syria and jordan , which washington wants as allies against iran 's nuclear ambitions .
at the same time , arab states also use the conflict to further their own foreign policy agendas , with syria and iran presumably supporting hamas with weapons and funding .
but the arab states also pursue differing aims .
" we do n't only have a clash of cultures , but also a conflict between sunnis and shiites within islam , " political scientist christian hacke of the university of bonn pointed out .
germany fails as eu president germany , too - which since january has held the rotating eu presidency - has failed to lead the way .
" the german eu council presidency was weak when it came to middle east policy , " steinbach said .
it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have steienmeier and merkel neglected the middle east ?
currently , the european union appears too busy with its own affairs to shift its focus to the middle east , bogged down as it is by the crisis over a new institutional treaty for the bloc , and , in terms of foreign policy , crippled by changes in government in france and britain .
political vacuum with hamas and fatah fighting , iraq in the midst of civil war , lebanon even more instable than it was a year ago , and iran possibly striving to develop a nuclear bomb , there 's little hope for peace at the moment .
and a route towards an end to conflict in the middle east is unlikely to come from the region itself .
" at the moment , we have a political vacuum of moderate , visionary powers among all parties , " steinbach said .
" the downward trend in the middle east is far from being brought to a halt , " he added . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him . " putin is a flawless example of an opponent of freedom of the press and expression , " netzwerk recherche head thomas leif said in his award speech this weekend in hamburg . " when the protection and guarantee of freedom of the press are concerned , putin follows principles closer to those of a dictatorship than of a democracy . " no reaction from russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : say what i want to hear and i 'll be glad to talk with you putin is the first non-german to receive the award which has been given out since 2002 .
the journalists ' organization , however , has not received a reply as to whether putin or russia 's ambassador to germany will be present to accept the award personally , according thomas schuler , a member of the organization 's executive board . there was plenty of reason for the group , which was formed in 2001 , to choose putin to receive this year 's award , schuler said , adding that netzwerk recherche counted 14 journalists who had been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances since putin came to power in 2000 .
none of the murders has been solved . " these murders and cases of journalists being persecuted have created a climate in russia that does not allow for criticism or debate , " schuler said .
" it 's a climate where self-censorship rules instead of freedom of expression .
netzwerk recherche is of the opinion that putin is responsible for this system . " reporters risking their lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in st. petersburg turned violent with journalists and other civilians being beaten and arrested oleg panfilov , who heads moscow 's center for journalism in extreme situations , also said putin deserved the award , adding that journalists who do not accept the official kremlin line are putting their physical well-being at risk . " independent journalists are constantly under pressure , " panfilov said .
" the reporters who do not let the state tame them are threatened at first , then beat up and sometimes even murdered . " the new york-based committee to protect journalists has named russia the third most dangerous place for reporters to work after iraq and algeria over the last 15 years . independent journalists and news outlets in russia must also spend time and money defending themselves from lawsuits they can not win because the courts side with the government , panfilov said . sign of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the cases of killed journalists , including that of anna politkovskaya , has been solved stephan stuchlik , a moscow television correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he saw just how much pressure reporters in russia are under while covering april opposition demonstrations in st. petersburg . " i got several elbows to the face and kicks in the stomach , " said stuchlik , who was taken into custody for filming the protests .
" i got the impression at the st. petersburg event that the direction was being given by the kremlin .
that it 's not such a big deal if a journalist gets beat up . " stuchlik and members of netzwerk recherche said the decision to give putin the closed oyster award was a german signal of solidarity with the minority of independent russian journalists , who enjoy freedom of expression in theory but not in practice .

the deal will see minimum wage protections extended beyond construction workers and building cleaners to another 10 to 12 industrial sectors .
merkel also brokered an agreement on raising mandatory contributions to statutory nursing care , costs which are shared by workers and employers , by 0.25 percent as of july 2008 while lowering unemployment insurance payments by 0.3 percent to 3.9 percent beginning in january . coalition in position to govern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only construction workers and cleaning people were covered by a minimum wage " i think that the coalition has shown that it is capable of solving problems , " christian democratic union parliamentary group leader volker kauder said tuesday . edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , the cdu bavarian sister party , said the compromise represented " a whole series of improvements . " " for us it was clear that there would not be a statutory minimum wage , " stoiber said , adding that the deal reached showed " even when the starting points are very far from each other , the grand coalition can succeed at coming to an outcome . " but members of the spd , who recent polls have shown to be trailing their coalition partners by nearly 10 percent , said the minimum wage deal , for which the social democrats have long pushed and the cdu has bitterly opposed , does not go far enough . debate to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition was not able to reach agreement on ending the post 's letter delivery monopoly " it is in no way a major breakthrough , " spd labor policy expert klaus brander told public broadcaster zdf , adding that a general minimum wage would have been of greater benefit to german workers . spd party head kurt beck said the debate over a minimum wage had not ended , adding that " the political discussion will continue . " germans seem largely in favor of a minimum wage , according to an emnid poll showing that 60 percent of germans were for the idea , with conservative voters also supporting the initiative . the iw cologne research institute said that if a 7.50 euro -lrb- $ 10.00 -rrb- minimum wage were adopted , more than 1 million jobs could be lost to under the table work , meaning less tax income for the government and social security contributions . europe 's largest economy , germany has recently experienced an economic improvement and dropped its unemployment rate from 12 percent in early 2006 to 9.1 percent . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 19.06.2007 putin wins journalists ' ' prize ' as press freedom opponent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independent journalists have a hard time getting comments out of russian president putin staying tightlipped can pay off if you 're running for the " closed oyster " trophy - a satirical recognition of the opponents of free press .
this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him . " putin is a flawless example of an opponent of freedom of the press and expression , " netzwerk recherche head thomas leif said in his award speech this weekend in hamburg . " when the protection and guarantee of freedom of the press are concerned , putin follows principles closer to those of a dictatorship than of a democracy . " no reaction from russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : say what i want to hear and i 'll be glad to talk with you putin is the first non-german to receive the award which has been given out since 2002 .
the journalists ' organization , however , has not received a reply as to whether putin or russia 's ambassador to germany will be present to accept the award personally , according thomas schuler , a member of the organization 's executive board . there was plenty of reason for the group , which was formed in 2001 , to choose putin to receive this year 's award , schuler said , adding that netzwerk recherche counted 14 journalists who had been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances since putin came to power in 2000 .
none of the murders has been solved . " these murders and cases of journalists being persecuted have created a climate in russia that does not allow for criticism or debate , " schuler said .
" it 's a climate where self-censorship rules instead of freedom of expression .
netzwerk recherche is of the opinion that putin is responsible for this system . " reporters risking their lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in st. petersburg turned violent with journalists and other civilians being beaten and arrested oleg panfilov , who heads moscow 's center for journalism in extreme situations , also said putin deserved the award , adding that journalists who do not accept the official kremlin line are putting their physical well-being at risk . " independent journalists are constantly under pressure , " panfilov said .
" the reporters who do not let the state tame them are threatened at first , then beat up and sometimes even murdered . " the new york-based committee to protect journalists has named russia the third most dangerous place for reporters to work after iraq and algeria over the last 15 years . independent journalists and news outlets in russia must also spend time and money defending themselves from lawsuits they can not win because the courts side with the government , panfilov said . sign of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the cases of killed journalists , including that of anna politkovskaya , has been solved stephan stuchlik , a moscow television correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he saw just how much pressure reporters in russia are under while covering april opposition demonstrations in st. petersburg . " i got several elbows to the face and kicks in the stomach , " said stuchlik , who was taken into custody for filming the protests .
" i got the impression at the st. petersburg event that the direction was being given by the kremlin .
that it 's not such a big deal if a journalist gets beat up . " stuchlik and members of netzwerk recherche said the decision to give putin the closed oyster award was a german signal of solidarity with the minority of independent russian journalists , who enjoy freedom of expression in theory but not in practice . " freedom of expression in russia is freedom to love putin - and most russians make use of it , " said heribert prantl , editor of the süddeutsche zeitung 's domestic german news . " freedom of expression in russia is the freedom to write what putin wants - and most media make use of it .

the rarely played piece was performed from 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- above ground this week . musicians johannes denhoff , luciana duta , zazie lewandowski and karl huros of braunschweig 's staatstheater climbed into helicopters and put their instruments to work on sunday to make the performance of contemporary composer karlheinz stockhausen 's " helicopter string quartet " a success .
" when you 're up above in the air , it is truly a feeling of euphoria , " denhoff told german news agency dpa .
" you feel like you 're part of a work of art . "
the " helicopter string quartet " consists of four helicopters and as many musicians .
the participants play from inside the hovering crafts .
the combined sound of the instruments and the helicopters make up the piece , which is part of a 29-hour work called " light cycle . "
audience crucial to success the concert of rotors and strings was broadcast in a hangar from which the helicopters took off .
once the helicopters reached the altitude of 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- and were visible only as small specks in the sky , the hangar doors closed and the audience turned to the four large screens on which they could follow the individual musicians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parity between man and machine ?
the braunschweig performance was only the third successful one ever .
the composer himself set the bar high as to what can be deemed acceptable performance : the helicopters must lift off three times within one day and have a new audience for each round .
all together , around 1,100 people watched the spectacle , according to the organizers .
technical feat " that was an extreme technical challenge , " admitted sound engineer olaf mielke , adding that the performance had been almost perfect , save one minor hiccup .
the piece was put on by the city of braunschweig , which currently holds the title " city of science 2007 , " and a contemporary music festival .
it cost around 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 173,000 -rrb- , 70,000 of which was paid for by the city .
the " helicopter string quartet " was previously played in amsterdam , in 1995 , and salzburg , in 2003 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the investigation centered on at least five officials , including chief executive joachim hunold , and supervisory board head johannes zurnieden , they added .
the insider trading allegations are connected with air berlin 's takeover of rival airline dba last year .
" there is a suspicion that the accused made use of insider knowledge over the planned takeover of a munich-based airline by a berlin-based airline , " the prosecutors ' statement said .
effect on stock price was unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin beat out lufthansa in the dba buyout battle the company officials are suspected of having bought around 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.0 million -rrb- of air berlin shares in june 2006 , shortly after having signed a confidentiality agreement and just before takeover talks began .
hunold and zurnieden are suspected of having bought 1.47 million euros worth of shares alone , the prosecutors said .
hunold , a media-savvy businessman who has led the airline 's rapid expansion , confirmed he was among those named in the inquiry and issued a statement denying the allegations .
" there was no knowing how much or even if the share price of air berlin would rise after the announcement , " he said .
" i first bought shares at the start of june 2006 when a lock-up period imposed on me under stock-exchange rules had expired . "
he said all the purchases had been duly reported to financial regulators and disclosed online .
" absurd inquiry " air berlin spokesman peter hauptvogel added that the shares were bought well before air berlin decided to buy dba , a move that sent the berlin airline 's stocks soaring .
hauptvogel , who said searches were also made at the homes of the suspects , described the inquiry as " absurd , " adding that it involved relatively modest sums of money .

if eu governments also decide to support the european commission 's proposal as expected , the import , export and sale of cat and dog fur , as well as any products containing their fur , will be banned from 2009 .
" the placing on the market and the import and export ... of fur of cats and dogs and products containing fur shall be prohibited , " according to the draft resolution .
the eu executive proposed the legislation after a public outcry when evidence showed cat and dog fur products were still being traded in the bloc despite a voluntary code of conduct prohibiting the practice .
misleading labels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu said dog fur was sold under other names british labor mep arlene mccarthy , who chairs the internal market and consumer protection committee , said many people unwittingly buy garments made with cat and dog fur due to improper labeling .
" the majority of cat and dog fur comes from china , where over 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their furs and skins , " she said .
" at least 10 dogs are slaughtered to make a single coat - more if puppies are used . "
a 2005 study conducted by the australian animal-rights group humane society international estimated that some 5,400 of the animals killed in china each day .
the european commission said the animals ' fur could be found on the european market in clothing , personal accessories and soft toys for children .
the commission added that by forcing member states to test for the fur , the bloc would be able to put together a clearer picture of what products it is used in .
matching international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bans on trading in cat and dog fur are already in place in other countries the parliament 's support for the ban on dog and cat fur has left green party parliamentarians hoping that similar bans could be introduced to protect other animals as well .
" this ban on the trade in cat and dog fur sets an important precedent and should pave the way for banning the trade in products from other animals on animal welfare grounds - notably seal products , " british green euro-deputy caroline lucas said .
the parliamentarians cut out a proposed loophole that would have allowed the trade of cat and dog fur as long was it did not come from animals bred only for their fur .
" the eu is taking an important step towards ending the cruel and brutal way in which these animals are slaughtered for their fur , " said heide rühle , a german green party member of the eu parliament .
" it is high time that a ban on the trade in cat and dog fur was introduced in the eu , with other countries , like the us and australia , having had bans in place for a number of years . "
fur trade group welcomes the decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote does not outlaw all fur trade the international fur trade federation , an industry association whose members already have a voluntary ban in place , also welcomed the parliament 's decision .
" we hope it will be positive for the legitimate fur trade and complement the voluntary ban on cat and dog furs we have been operating for the last five years , " it said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hope that we will achieve a compromise which should be arrived at easily and that we will not be forced to exercise our veto right , " polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski said during a joint news conference .
invited to the mini-summit , portuguese prime minister jose socrates expressed concern that the eu 's 27-member summit in brussels on thursday and friday could fail .
all of eu requires breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveys shows that a majority of poles would accept the eu reforms as presented " europe needs a compromise , " socrates told reporters .
" a failure would mean that all of us would lose . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier agreed with socrates , saying all eu members would lose out if they ca n't reach a deal at this week 's summit .
" if there is no compromise , no agreement to be reached at the council later this week , everyone will have lost - the european union and each and every member country , " he said .
portugal , which takes over the eu rotating presidency on july 1 , was invited to the bratislava meeting , and socrates indicated he would try to persuade euroskeptic countries like poland to back a breakthrough deal on the eu 's future functioning .
continuing uncertainty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said eu voting reforms would lessen warsaw 's influence agreement on the sorely-needed reform package could end two years of political uncertainty sparked by the failure of the eu 's constitution , which was rejected in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
some observers have said if poland vetoes the reforms that political uncertainty would continue .
poland wants changes to the system of national voting powers at the heart of eu decision-making .
the proposed voting system is skewed in favor of countries with large populations , like germany , according to polish president kaczynski .
" it is not possible that the vote of a citizen in one country may have twice the weight of that from another country , " he said .
" this is very important for the future ; we have to continue with this fight .
" often , in the past , people have fought for things and only history has proved them right , " he said , warning that eu countries should not be split into " good " and " bad " or " obedient " and " disobedient " members .
half-hearted czech support the czech republic is backing poland 's stand and a dutch proposal to boost national parliament 's powers to supervise the eu 's legislative proceedings .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said warsaw had received signals of a possible compromise but told reporters : " i want to say explicitly that for poland to accept the voting system in the european constitution is not a compromise . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said it does n't want to stop the eu but would not agree to a compromise at any price hungary and slovakia support efforts led by germany , the current eu president , to breathe new life into a proposed european constitution which has been on ice since it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
" the slovak government will not support changes which go against the agreements already concluded within the framework of the constitutional treaty , " slovak prime minister robert fico said .
" the eu should stop being preoccupied with itself and turn as soon as possible to issues which are important for everyday society . "
extended talks possible the hungarian and slovak parliaments ratified the now mothballed constitution , along with 16 other member states , while the czech republic and poland indefinitely postponed discussion of the constitution .
germany admitted it realized that despite narrowing differences on some issues , " it 's also clear that there are still some very serious problems to solve , " said government spokesman ulrich wilhelm , who - predicting a hot and drawn-out summit - advised reporters to pack a third shirt as debate could last longer than the two-day summit originally scheduled . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal will see minimum wage protections extended beyond construction workers and building cleaners to another 10 to 12 industrial sectors .
merkel also brokered an agreement on raising mandatory contributions to statutory nursing care , costs which are shared by workers and employers , by 0.25 percent as of july 2008 while lowering unemployment insurance payments by 0.3 percent to 3.9 percent beginning in january . coalition in position to govern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only construction workers and cleaning people were covered by a minimum wage " i think that the coalition has shown that it is capable of solving problems , " christian democratic union parliamentary group leader volker kauder said tuesday . edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , the cdu bavarian sister party , said the compromise represented " a whole series of improvements .

" germans seem largely in favor of a minimum wage , according to an emnid poll showing that 60 percent of germans were for the idea , with conservative voters also supporting the initiative . the iw cologne research institute said that if a 7.50 euro -lrb- $ 10.00 -rrb- minimum wage were adopted , more than 1 million jobs could be lost to under the table work , meaning less tax income for the government and social security contributions . europe 's largest economy , germany has recently experienced an economic improvement and dropped its unemployment rate from 12 percent in early 2006 to 9.1 percent . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if eu governments also decide to support the european commission 's proposal as expected , the import , export and sale of cat and dog fur , as well as any products containing their fur , will be banned from 2009 .
" the placing on the market and the import and export ... of fur of cats and dogs and products containing fur shall be prohibited , " according to the draft resolution .
the eu executive proposed the legislation after a public outcry when evidence showed cat and dog fur products were still being traded in the bloc despite a voluntary code of conduct prohibiting the practice .
misleading labels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu said dog fur was sold under other names british labor mep arlene mccarthy , who chairs the internal market and consumer protection committee , said many people unwittingly buy garments made with cat and dog fur due to improper labeling .
" the majority of cat and dog fur comes from china , where over 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their furs and skins , " she said .
" at least 10 dogs are slaughtered to make a single coat - more if puppies are used . "
a 2005 study conducted by the australian animal-rights group humane society international estimated that some 5,400 of the animals killed in china each day .
the european commission said the animals ' fur could be found on the european market in clothing , personal accessories and soft toys for children .
the commission added that by forcing member states to test for the fur , the bloc would be able to put together a clearer picture of what products it is used in .
matching international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bans on trading in cat and dog fur are already in place in other countries the parliament 's support for the ban on dog and cat fur has left green party parliamentarians hoping that similar bans could be introduced to protect other animals as well .
" this ban on the trade in cat and dog fur sets an important precedent and should pave the way for banning the trade in products from other animals on animal welfare grounds - notably seal products , " british green euro-deputy caroline lucas said .
the parliamentarians cut out a proposed loophole that would have allowed the trade of cat and dog fur as long was it did not come from animals bred only for their fur .
" the eu is taking an important step towards ending the cruel and brutal way in which these animals are slaughtered for their fur , " said heide rühle , a german green party member of the eu parliament .
" it is high time that a ban on the trade in cat and dog fur was introduced in the eu , with other countries , like the us and australia , having had bans in place for a number of years . "
fur trade group welcomes the decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote does not outlaw all fur trade the international fur trade federation , an industry association whose members already have a voluntary ban in place , also welcomed the parliament 's decision .
" we hope it will be positive for the legitimate fur trade and complement the voluntary ban on cat and dog furs we have been operating for the last five years , " it said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hope that we will achieve a compromise which should be arrived at easily and that we will not be forced to exercise our veto right , " polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski said during a joint news conference .
invited to the mini-summit , portuguese prime minister jose socrates expressed concern that the eu 's 27-member summit in brussels on thursday and friday could fail .
all of eu requires breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveys shows that a majority of poles would accept the eu reforms as presented " europe needs a compromise , " socrates told reporters .
" a failure would mean that all of us would lose . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier agreed with socrates , saying all eu members would lose out if they ca n't reach a deal at this week 's summit .
" if there is no compromise , no agreement to be reached at the council later this week , everyone will have lost - the european union and each and every member country , " he said .
portugal , which takes over the eu rotating presidency on july 1 , was invited to the bratislava meeting , and socrates indicated he would try to persuade euroskeptic countries like poland to back a breakthrough deal on the eu 's future functioning .
continuing uncertainty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said eu voting reforms would lessen warsaw 's influence agreement on the sorely-needed reform package could end two years of political uncertainty sparked by the failure of the eu 's constitution , which was rejected in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
some observers have said if poland vetoes the reforms that political uncertainty would continue .
poland wants changes to the system of national voting powers at the heart of eu decision-making .
the proposed voting system is skewed in favor of countries with large populations , like germany , according to polish president kaczynski .
" it is not possible that the vote of a citizen in one country may have twice the weight of that from another country , " he said .
" this is very important for the future ; we have to continue with this fight .
" often , in the past , people have fought for things and only history has proved them right , " he said , warning that eu countries should not be split into " good " and " bad " or " obedient " and " disobedient " members .
half-hearted czech support the czech republic is backing poland 's stand and a dutch proposal to boost national parliament 's powers to supervise the eu 's legislative proceedings .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said warsaw had received signals of a possible compromise but told reporters : " i want to say explicitly that for poland to accept the voting system in the european constitution is not a compromise . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said it does n't want to stop the eu but would not agree to a compromise at any price hungary and slovakia support efforts led by germany , the current eu president , to breathe new life into a proposed european constitution which has been on ice since it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
" the slovak government will not support changes which go against the agreements already concluded within the framework of the constitutional treaty , " slovak prime minister robert fico said .
" the eu should stop being preoccupied with itself and turn as soon as possible to issues which are important for everyday society . "
extended talks possible the hungarian and slovak parliaments ratified the now mothballed constitution , along with 16 other member states , while the czech republic and poland indefinitely postponed discussion of the constitution .
germany admitted it realized that despite narrowing differences on some issues , " it 's also clear that there are still some very serious problems to solve , " said government spokesman ulrich wilhelm , who - predicting a hot and drawn-out summit - advised reporters to pack a third shirt as debate could last longer than the two-day summit originally scheduled . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

worse still , the west has contributed to the current crisis in the palestinian territories , according to middle east experts . the united states and europe restored direct aid to the palestinians this week in a show of support for president mahmud abbas , who set up an emergency government when his hamas rivals seized power in gaza last week after days of brutal bloodletting .
islamist group hamas however accused the west on tuesday of playing politics with palestinian aid while their gaza bastion remains under israeli blockade .
" by announcing their political and financial support for the palestinian authority , the west is backing an illegitimate government , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said .
eu and us support for the government of prime minister salam fayyad was " an attempt to manipulate the palestinian people and distance it from hamas , " he charged , adding that the strategy would not work .
hamas is not alone in its criticism of the west .
" the international community shares the guilt for the escalation in the middle east , " said udo steinbach , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
hamastan and fatahstan after months of fighting , hamas and fatah had agreed in february to set up a joint government , with saudi arabia acting as a mediator and bringing the two groups together in a symbolic mecca meeting .
meanwhile , the united states backed fatah by providing security training and arms , and israel froze palestinian tax funds for fear that hamas would use the money to finance terror attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian in-fighting pushes peace with israel further into the realm of the unimaginable " by turning against hamas , the united states and israel delegitimated the saudi attempts to mediate , " steinbach said .
the result was politically divided palestinian territories , derisively called " hamastan " and " fatahstan . "
the us has pushed for movement in the israel-palestinian conflict to curry favor with moderate islamic countries , such as syria and jordan , which washington wants as allies against iran 's nuclear ambitions .
at the same time , arab states also use the conflict to further their own foreign policy agendas , with syria and iran presumably supporting hamas with weapons and funding .
but the arab states also pursue differing aims .
" we do n't only have a clash of cultures , but also a conflict between sunnis and shiites within islam , " political scientist christian hacke of the university of bonn pointed out .
germany fails as eu president germany , too - which since january has held the rotating eu presidency - has failed to lead the way .
" the german eu council presidency was weak when it came to middle east policy , " steinbach said .
it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have steienmeier and merkel neglected the middle east ?
currently , the european union appears too busy with its own affairs to shift its focus to the middle east , bogged down as it is by the crisis over a new institutional treaty for the bloc , and , in terms of foreign policy , crippled by changes in government in france and britain .
political vacuum with hamas and fatah fighting , iraq in the midst of civil war , lebanon even more instable than it was a year ago , and iran possibly striving to develop a nuclear bomb , there 's little hope for peace at the moment .
and a route towards an end to conflict in the middle east is unlikely to come from the region itself .
" at the moment , we have a political vacuum of moderate , visionary powers among all parties , " steinbach said .

european voters place german chancellor angela merkel first when it comes to taking on a strong leadership role in european union , according to a new study released on tuesday . twenty-eight percent of the electorate in europe believes german chancellor angela merkel should assume a strong leadership role in the european union .
this puts her a long way ahead of other european politicians , according the survey conducted by germany 's bertelsmann foundation in 14 of the eu 's 27 members states .
some 47 percent of the 13,840 persons questioned felt the eu needs politicians capable of providing greater political leadership , while 32 percent said they did not believe there was a leadership deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose barroso following merkel in terms of popularity was european commission president jose barroso on 20 percent .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy achieved 15 percent , followed by british prime minister designate gordon brown with 14 percent .
home support the german chancellor 's popularity was highest in her native country , where she scored 58 percent .
in france 36 percent of those interviewed hoped she would assume a strong leadership role .
but she scored only 17 percent in germany 's neighbor poland and came bottom with 11 percent in britain , according to the survey which was conducted in may and june .
the chancellor faces a major test later this week when she seeks to persuade eu leaders to agree on a new treaty to replace the bloc 's draft constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
facing opponents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel be able to charm poland 's kaczynski ?
poland and britain have raised objections to the revised draft that merkel will present to a summit in brussels on june 21-22 , shortly before germany 's term as rotating eu present expires at the end of the month .
poland has threatened to block approval because it objects to the draft 's weighted voting system which it says gives unfair advantage to large countries like germany at warsaw 's expense .
britain is opposed to the role of an eu foreign minister mentioned in the draft and is also unhappy about the charter of fundamental rights laying down civic entitlements for all europeans . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european voters place german chancellor angela merkel first when it comes to taking on a strong leadership role in european union , according to a new study released on tuesday . twenty-eight percent of the electorate in europe believes german chancellor angela merkel should assume a strong leadership role in the european union .
this puts her a long way ahead of other european politicians , according the survey conducted by germany 's bertelsmann foundation in 14 of the eu 's 27 members states .
some 47 percent of the 13,840 persons questioned felt the eu needs politicians capable of providing greater political leadership , while 32 percent said they did not believe there was a leadership deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose barroso following merkel in terms of popularity was european commission president jose barroso on 20 percent .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy achieved 15 percent , followed by british prime minister designate gordon brown with 14 percent .
home support the german chancellor 's popularity was highest in her native country , where she scored 58 percent .
in france 36 percent of those interviewed hoped she would assume a strong leadership role .
but she scored only 17 percent in germany 's neighbor poland and came bottom with 11 percent in britain , according to the survey which was conducted in may and june .
the chancellor faces a major test later this week when she seeks to persuade eu leaders to agree on a new treaty to replace the bloc 's draft constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
facing opponents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel be able to charm poland 's kaczynski ?
poland and britain have raised objections to the revised draft that merkel will present to a summit in brussels on june 21-22 , shortly before germany 's term as rotating eu present expires at the end of the month .
poland has threatened to block approval because it objects to the draft 's weighted voting system which it says gives unfair advantage to large countries like germany at warsaw 's expense .
britain is opposed to the role of an eu foreign minister mentioned in the draft and is also unhappy about the charter of fundamental rights laying down civic entitlements for all europeans . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hope that we will achieve a compromise which should be arrived at easily and that we will not be forced to exercise our veto right , " polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski said during a joint news conference .
invited to the mini-summit , portuguese prime minister jose socrates expressed concern that the eu 's 27-member summit in brussels on thursday and friday could fail .
all of eu requires breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveys shows that a majority of poles would accept the eu reforms as presented " europe needs a compromise , " socrates told reporters .
" a failure would mean that all of us would lose . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier agreed with socrates , saying all eu members would lose out if they ca n't reach a deal at this week 's summit .
" if there is no compromise , no agreement to be reached at the council later this week , everyone will have lost - the european union and each and every member country , " he said .
portugal , which takes over the eu rotating presidency on july 1 , was invited to the bratislava meeting , and socrates indicated he would try to persuade euroskeptic countries like poland to back a breakthrough deal on the eu 's future functioning .
continuing uncertainty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said eu voting reforms would lessen warsaw 's influence agreement on the sorely-needed reform package could end two years of political uncertainty sparked by the failure of the eu 's constitution , which was rejected in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
some observers have said if poland vetoes the reforms that political uncertainty would continue .
poland wants changes to the system of national voting powers at the heart of eu decision-making .
the proposed voting system is skewed in favor of countries with large populations , like germany , according to polish president kaczynski .
" it is not possible that the vote of a citizen in one country may have twice the weight of that from another country , " he said .
" this is very important for the future ; we have to continue with this fight .
" often , in the past , people have fought for things and only history has proved them right , " he said , warning that eu countries should not be split into " good " and " bad " or " obedient " and " disobedient " members .
half-hearted czech support the czech republic is backing poland 's stand and a dutch proposal to boost national parliament 's powers to supervise the eu 's legislative proceedings .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said warsaw had received signals of a possible compromise but told reporters : " i want to say explicitly that for poland to accept the voting system in the european constitution is not a compromise . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said it does n't want to stop the eu but would not agree to a compromise at any price hungary and slovakia support efforts led by germany , the current eu president , to breathe new life into a proposed european constitution which has been on ice since it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
" the slovak government will not support changes which go against the agreements already concluded within the framework of the constitutional treaty , " slovak prime minister robert fico said .
" the eu should stop being preoccupied with itself and turn as soon as possible to issues which are important for everyday society . "
extended talks possible the hungarian and slovak parliaments ratified the now mothballed constitution , along with 16 other member states , while the czech republic and poland indefinitely postponed discussion of the constitution .
germany admitted it realized that despite narrowing differences on some issues , " it 's also clear that there are still some very serious problems to solve , " said government spokesman ulrich wilhelm , who - predicting a hot and drawn-out summit - advised reporters to pack a third shirt as debate could last longer than the two-day summit originally scheduled . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 19.06.2007 west shares blame for middle east crisis , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has contributed to the problems in the middle east , some say the eu and the us have failed to resuscitate the middle east peace process .
worse still , the west has contributed to the current crisis in the palestinian territories , according to middle east experts . the united states and europe restored direct aid to the palestinians this week in a show of support for president mahmud abbas , who set up an emergency government when his hamas rivals seized power in gaza last week after days of brutal bloodletting .
islamist group hamas however accused the west on tuesday of playing politics with palestinian aid while their gaza bastion remains under israeli blockade .
" by announcing their political and financial support for the palestinian authority , the west is backing an illegitimate government , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said .
eu and us support for the government of prime minister salam fayyad was " an attempt to manipulate the palestinian people and distance it from hamas , " he charged , adding that the strategy would not work .
hamas is not alone in its criticism of the west .
" the international community shares the guilt for the escalation in the middle east , " said udo steinbach , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
hamastan and fatahstan after months of fighting , hamas and fatah had agreed in february to set up a joint government , with saudi arabia acting as a mediator and bringing the two groups together in a symbolic mecca meeting .
meanwhile , the united states backed fatah by providing security training and arms , and israel froze palestinian tax funds for fear that hamas would use the money to finance terror attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian in-fighting pushes peace with israel further into the realm of the unimaginable " by turning against hamas , the united states and israel delegitimated the saudi attempts to mediate , " steinbach said .
the result was politically divided palestinian territories , derisively called " hamastan " and " fatahstan . "
the us has pushed for movement in the israel-palestinian conflict to curry favor with moderate islamic countries , such as syria and jordan , which washington wants as allies against iran 's nuclear ambitions .
at the same time , arab states also use the conflict to further their own foreign policy agendas , with syria and iran presumably supporting hamas with weapons and funding .
but the arab states also pursue differing aims .
" we do n't only have a clash of cultures , but also a conflict between sunnis and shiites within islam , " political scientist christian hacke of the university of bonn pointed out .
germany fails as eu president germany , too - which since january has held the rotating eu presidency - has failed to lead the way .
" the german eu council presidency was weak when it came to middle east policy , " steinbach said .
it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have steienmeier and merkel neglected the middle east ?
currently , the european union appears too busy with its own affairs to shift its focus to the middle east , bogged down as it is by the crisis over a new institutional treaty for the bloc , and , in terms of foreign policy , crippled by changes in government in france and britain .
political vacuum with hamas and fatah fighting , iraq in the midst of civil war , lebanon even more instable than it was a year ago , and iran possibly striving to develop a nuclear bomb , there 's little hope for peace at the moment .
and a route towards an end to conflict in the middle east is unlikely to come from the region itself .
" at the moment , we have a political vacuum of moderate , visionary powers among all parties , " steinbach said .
" the downward trend in the middle east is far from being brought to a halt , " he added . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

worse still , the west has contributed to the current crisis in the palestinian territories , according to middle east experts . the united states and europe restored direct aid to the palestinians this week in a show of support for president mahmud abbas , who set up an emergency government when his hamas rivals seized power in gaza last week after days of brutal bloodletting .
islamist group hamas however accused the west on tuesday of playing politics with palestinian aid while their gaza bastion remains under israeli blockade .
" by announcing their political and financial support for the palestinian authority , the west is backing an illegitimate government , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said .
eu and us support for the government of prime minister salam fayyad was " an attempt to manipulate the palestinian people and distance it from hamas , " he charged , adding that the strategy would not work .
hamas is not alone in its criticism of the west .
" the international community shares the guilt for the escalation in the middle east , " said udo steinbach , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
hamastan and fatahstan after months of fighting , hamas and fatah had agreed in february to set up a joint government , with saudi arabia acting as a mediator and bringing the two groups together in a symbolic mecca meeting .
meanwhile , the united states backed fatah by providing security training and arms , and israel froze palestinian tax funds for fear that hamas would use the money to finance terror attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian in-fighting pushes peace with israel further into the realm of the unimaginable " by turning against hamas , the united states and israel delegitimated the saudi attempts to mediate , " steinbach said .
the result was politically divided palestinian territories , derisively called " hamastan " and " fatahstan . "
the us has pushed for movement in the israel-palestinian conflict to curry favor with moderate islamic countries , such as syria and jordan , which washington wants as allies against iran 's nuclear ambitions .
at the same time , arab states also use the conflict to further their own foreign policy agendas , with syria and iran presumably supporting hamas with weapons and funding .
but the arab states also pursue differing aims .
" we do n't only have a clash of cultures , but also a conflict between sunnis and shiites within islam , " political scientist christian hacke of the university of bonn pointed out .
germany fails as eu president germany , too - which since january has held the rotating eu presidency - has failed to lead the way .
" the german eu council presidency was weak when it came to middle east policy , " steinbach said .
it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have steienmeier and merkel neglected the middle east ?
currently , the european union appears too busy with its own affairs to shift its focus to the middle east , bogged down as it is by the crisis over a new institutional treaty for the bloc , and , in terms of foreign policy , crippled by changes in government in france and britain .
political vacuum with hamas and fatah fighting , iraq in the midst of civil war , lebanon even more instable than it was a year ago , and iran possibly striving to develop a nuclear bomb , there 's little hope for peace at the moment .
and a route towards an end to conflict in the middle east is unlikely to come from the region itself .
" at the moment , we have a political vacuum of moderate , visionary powers among all parties , " steinbach said .

to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .
it 's targeting a specific group - western german retirees . in several cities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , some senior citizens walking in shopping areas have had small packets pressed into their hands .
they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .

" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "

the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .

gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .

european voters place german chancellor angela merkel first when it comes to taking on a strong leadership role in european union , according to a new study released on tuesday . twenty-eight percent of the electorate in europe believes german chancellor angela merkel should assume a strong leadership role in the european union .
this puts her a long way ahead of other european politicians , according the survey conducted by germany 's bertelsmann foundation in 14 of the eu 's 27 members states .
some 47 percent of the 13,840 persons questioned felt the eu needs politicians capable of providing greater political leadership , while 32 percent said they did not believe there was a leadership deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose barroso following merkel in terms of popularity was european commission president jose barroso on 20 percent .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy achieved 15 percent , followed by british prime minister designate gordon brown with 14 percent .
home support the german chancellor 's popularity was highest in her native country , where she scored 58 percent .
in france 36 percent of those interviewed hoped she would assume a strong leadership role .
but she scored only 17 percent in germany 's neighbor poland and came bottom with 11 percent in britain , according to the survey which was conducted in may and june .
the chancellor faces a major test later this week when she seeks to persuade eu leaders to agree on a new treaty to replace the bloc 's draft constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
facing opponents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel be able to charm poland 's kaczynski ?
poland and britain have raised objections to the revised draft that merkel will present to a summit in brussels on june 21-22 , shortly before germany 's term as rotating eu present expires at the end of the month .
poland has threatened to block approval because it objects to the draft 's weighted voting system which it says gives unfair advantage to large countries like germany at warsaw 's expense .
britain is opposed to the role of an eu foreign minister mentioned in the draft and is also unhappy about the charter of fundamental rights laying down civic entitlements for all europeans . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hope that we will achieve a compromise which should be arrived at easily and that we will not be forced to exercise our veto right , " polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski said during a joint news conference .
invited to the mini-summit , portuguese prime minister jose socrates expressed concern that the eu 's 27-member summit in brussels on thursday and friday could fail .
all of eu requires breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveys shows that a majority of poles would accept the eu reforms as presented " europe needs a compromise , " socrates told reporters .
" a failure would mean that all of us would lose . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier agreed with socrates , saying all eu members would lose out if they ca n't reach a deal at this week 's summit .
" if there is no compromise , no agreement to be reached at the council later this week , everyone will have lost - the european union and each and every member country , " he said .
portugal , which takes over the eu rotating presidency on july 1 , was invited to the bratislava meeting , and socrates indicated he would try to persuade euroskeptic countries like poland to back a breakthrough deal on the eu 's future functioning .
continuing uncertainty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said eu voting reforms would lessen warsaw 's influence agreement on the sorely-needed reform package could end two years of political uncertainty sparked by the failure of the eu 's constitution , which was rejected in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
some observers have said if poland vetoes the reforms that political uncertainty would continue .
poland wants changes to the system of national voting powers at the heart of eu decision-making .
the proposed voting system is skewed in favor of countries with large populations , like germany , according to polish president kaczynski .
" it is not possible that the vote of a citizen in one country may have twice the weight of that from another country , " he said .
" this is very important for the future ; we have to continue with this fight .
" often , in the past , people have fought for things and only history has proved them right , " he said , warning that eu countries should not be split into " good " and " bad " or " obedient " and " disobedient " members .
half-hearted czech support the czech republic is backing poland 's stand and a dutch proposal to boost national parliament 's powers to supervise the eu 's legislative proceedings .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said warsaw had received signals of a possible compromise but told reporters : " i want to say explicitly that for poland to accept the voting system in the european constitution is not a compromise . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said it does n't want to stop the eu but would not agree to a compromise at any price hungary and slovakia support efforts led by germany , the current eu president , to breathe new life into a proposed european constitution which has been on ice since it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
" the slovak government will not support changes which go against the agreements already concluded within the framework of the constitutional treaty , " slovak prime minister robert fico said .
" the eu should stop being preoccupied with itself and turn as soon as possible to issues which are important for everyday society . "
extended talks possible the hungarian and slovak parliaments ratified the now mothballed constitution , along with 16 other member states , while the czech republic and poland indefinitely postponed discussion of the constitution .
germany admitted it realized that despite narrowing differences on some issues , " it 's also clear that there are still some very serious problems to solve , " said government spokesman ulrich wilhelm , who - predicting a hot and drawn-out summit - advised reporters to pack a third shirt as debate could last longer than the two-day summit originally scheduled . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.06.2007 eu parliament votes to ban trading in cat and dog fur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission estimated that 2 million cats and dogs are killed for their fur each year european lawmakers moved tuesday to keep fluffy and fido out of clothing and stuffed kids ' toys by prohibiting the trade in cat and dog fur after a voluntary ban was found to be ineffective . european parliamentarians voted in favor of a proposed ban on the trade in cat and dog fur in the 27-nation bloc .
if eu governments also decide to support the european commission 's proposal as expected , the import , export and sale of cat and dog fur , as well as any products containing their fur , will be banned from 2009 .
" the placing on the market and the import and export ... of fur of cats and dogs and products containing fur shall be prohibited , " according to the draft resolution .
the eu executive proposed the legislation after a public outcry when evidence showed cat and dog fur products were still being traded in the bloc despite a voluntary code of conduct prohibiting the practice .
misleading labels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu said dog fur was sold under other names british labor mep arlene mccarthy , who chairs the internal market and consumer protection committee , said many people unwittingly buy garments made with cat and dog fur due to improper labeling .
" the majority of cat and dog fur comes from china , where over 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their furs and skins , " she said .
" at least 10 dogs are slaughtered to make a single coat - more if puppies are used . "
a 2005 study conducted by the australian animal-rights group humane society international estimated that some 5,400 of the animals killed in china each day .
the european commission said the animals ' fur could be found on the european market in clothing , personal accessories and soft toys for children .
the commission added that by forcing member states to test for the fur , the bloc would be able to put together a clearer picture of what products it is used in .
matching international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bans on trading in cat and dog fur are already in place in other countries the parliament 's support for the ban on dog and cat fur has left green party parliamentarians hoping that similar bans could be introduced to protect other animals as well .
" this ban on the trade in cat and dog fur sets an important precedent and should pave the way for banning the trade in products from other animals on animal welfare grounds - notably seal products , " british green euro-deputy caroline lucas said .
the parliamentarians cut out a proposed loophole that would have allowed the trade of cat and dog fur as long was it did not come from animals bred only for their fur .
" the eu is taking an important step towards ending the cruel and brutal way in which these animals are slaughtered for their fur , " said heide rühle , a german green party member of the eu parliament .
" it is high time that a ban on the trade in cat and dog fur was introduced in the eu , with other countries , like the us and australia , having had bans in place for a number of years . "
fur trade group welcomes the decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote does not outlaw all fur trade the international fur trade federation , an industry association whose members already have a voluntary ban in place , also welcomed the parliament 's decision .
" we hope it will be positive for the legitimate fur trade and complement the voluntary ban on cat and dog furs we have been operating for the last five years , " it said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european voters place german chancellor angela merkel first when it comes to taking on a strong leadership role in european union , according to a new study released on tuesday . twenty-eight percent of the electorate in europe believes german chancellor angela merkel should assume a strong leadership role in the european union .
this puts her a long way ahead of other european politicians , according the survey conducted by germany 's bertelsmann foundation in 14 of the eu 's 27 members states .
some 47 percent of the 13,840 persons questioned felt the eu needs politicians capable of providing greater political leadership , while 32 percent said they did not believe there was a leadership deficit .

in france 36 percent of those interviewed hoped she would assume a strong leadership role .
but she scored only 17 percent in germany 's neighbor poland and came bottom with 11 percent in britain , according to the survey which was conducted in may and june .

poland and britain have raised objections to the revised draft that merkel will present to a summit in brussels on june 21-22 , shortly before germany 's term as rotating eu present expires at the end of the month .
poland has threatened to block approval because it objects to the draft 's weighted voting system which it says gives unfair advantage to large countries like germany at warsaw 's expense .

if eu governments also decide to support the european commission 's proposal as expected , the import , export and sale of cat and dog fur , as well as any products containing their fur , will be banned from 2009 .
" the placing on the market and the import and export ... of fur of cats and dogs and products containing fur shall be prohibited , " according to the draft resolution .
the eu executive proposed the legislation after a public outcry when evidence showed cat and dog fur products were still being traded in the bloc despite a voluntary code of conduct prohibiting the practice .
misleading labels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu said dog fur was sold under other names british labor mep arlene mccarthy , who chairs the internal market and consumer protection committee , said many people unwittingly buy garments made with cat and dog fur due to improper labeling .
" the majority of cat and dog fur comes from china , where over 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their furs and skins , " she said .
" at least 10 dogs are slaughtered to make a single coat - more if puppies are used . "
a 2005 study conducted by the australian animal-rights group humane society international estimated that some 5,400 of the animals killed in china each day .
the european commission said the animals ' fur could be found on the european market in clothing , personal accessories and soft toys for children .
the commission added that by forcing member states to test for the fur , the bloc would be able to put together a clearer picture of what products it is used in .
matching international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bans on trading in cat and dog fur are already in place in other countries the parliament 's support for the ban on dog and cat fur has left green party parliamentarians hoping that similar bans could be introduced to protect other animals as well .
" this ban on the trade in cat and dog fur sets an important precedent and should pave the way for banning the trade in products from other animals on animal welfare grounds - notably seal products , " british green euro-deputy caroline lucas said .
the parliamentarians cut out a proposed loophole that would have allowed the trade of cat and dog fur as long was it did not come from animals bred only for their fur .
" the eu is taking an important step towards ending the cruel and brutal way in which these animals are slaughtered for their fur , " said heide rühle , a german green party member of the eu parliament .
" it is high time that a ban on the trade in cat and dog fur was introduced in the eu , with other countries , like the us and australia , having had bans in place for a number of years . "
fur trade group welcomes the decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote does not outlaw all fur trade the international fur trade federation , an industry association whose members already have a voluntary ban in place , also welcomed the parliament 's decision .
" we hope it will be positive for the legitimate fur trade and complement the voluntary ban on cat and dog furs we have been operating for the last five years , " it said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal will see minimum wage protections extended beyond construction workers and building cleaners to another 10 to 12 industrial sectors .
merkel also brokered an agreement on raising mandatory contributions to statutory nursing care , costs which are shared by workers and employers , by 0.25 percent as of july 2008 while lowering unemployment insurance payments by 0.3 percent to 3.9 percent beginning in january . coalition in position to govern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only construction workers and cleaning people were covered by a minimum wage " i think that the coalition has shown that it is capable of solving problems , " christian democratic union parliamentary group leader volker kauder said tuesday . edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , the cdu bavarian sister party , said the compromise represented " a whole series of improvements .

the most important thing was to convince people that open borders were not something dangerous , schäuble said after a meeting with his czech republic counterpart ivan langer in berlin .
langer said he was convinced that security would not deteriorate after the borders were opened , pointing to improved cooperation between national police forces under the schengen information system .
growing club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border controls can be reimposed for special events such as the g8 summit fifteen countries are currently members of the schengen accord : austria , belgium , denmark , finland , france , germany , iceland , italy , greece , luxembourg , netherlands , norway , portugal , spain and sweden .
all except norway and iceland are european union members .
nine of the 10 countries that joined the eu in its " big bang " expansion in 2004 will be eligible to join at the end of the year .
they are poland , the czech republic , hungary , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania and malta .
cyprus , the 10th country , will not be joining .
nor will romania and bulgaria , which became eu members this year .

more countries joined the treaty over the years .
people within the schengen zone can travel freely from one country to another without internal border controls .

worse still , the west has contributed to the current crisis in the palestinian territories , according to middle east experts . the united states and europe restored direct aid to the palestinians this week in a show of support for president mahmud abbas , who set up an emergency government when his hamas rivals seized power in gaza last week after days of brutal bloodletting .
islamist group hamas however accused the west on tuesday of playing politics with palestinian aid while their gaza bastion remains under israeli blockade .
" by announcing their political and financial support for the palestinian authority , the west is backing an illegitimate government , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said .
eu and us support for the government of prime minister salam fayyad was " an attempt to manipulate the palestinian people and distance it from hamas , " he charged , adding that the strategy would not work .
hamas is not alone in its criticism of the west .
" the international community shares the guilt for the escalation in the middle east , " said udo steinbach , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
hamastan and fatahstan after months of fighting , hamas and fatah had agreed in february to set up a joint government , with saudi arabia acting as a mediator and bringing the two groups together in a symbolic mecca meeting .
meanwhile , the united states backed fatah by providing security training and arms , and israel froze palestinian tax funds for fear that hamas would use the money to finance terror attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian in-fighting pushes peace with israel further into the realm of the unimaginable " by turning against hamas , the united states and israel delegitimated the saudi attempts to mediate , " steinbach said .
the result was politically divided palestinian territories , derisively called " hamastan " and " fatahstan . "
the us has pushed for movement in the israel-palestinian conflict to curry favor with moderate islamic countries , such as syria and jordan , which washington wants as allies against iran 's nuclear ambitions .
at the same time , arab states also use the conflict to further their own foreign policy agendas , with syria and iran presumably supporting hamas with weapons and funding .
but the arab states also pursue differing aims .
" we do n't only have a clash of cultures , but also a conflict between sunnis and shiites within islam , " political scientist christian hacke of the university of bonn pointed out .
germany fails as eu president germany , too - which since january has held the rotating eu presidency - has failed to lead the way .
" the german eu council presidency was weak when it came to middle east policy , " steinbach said .
it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have steienmeier and merkel neglected the middle east ?
currently , the european union appears too busy with its own affairs to shift its focus to the middle east , bogged down as it is by the crisis over a new institutional treaty for the bloc , and , in terms of foreign policy , crippled by changes in government in france and britain .
political vacuum with hamas and fatah fighting , iraq in the midst of civil war , lebanon even more instable than it was a year ago , and iran possibly striving to develop a nuclear bomb , there 's little hope for peace at the moment .
and a route towards an end to conflict in the middle east is unlikely to come from the region itself .

worse still , the west has contributed to the current crisis in the palestinian territories , according to middle east experts . the united states and europe restored direct aid to the palestinians this week in a show of support for president mahmud abbas , who set up an emergency government when his hamas rivals seized power in gaza last week after days of brutal bloodletting .
islamist group hamas however accused the west on tuesday of playing politics with palestinian aid while their gaza bastion remains under israeli blockade .
" by announcing their political and financial support for the palestinian authority , the west is backing an illegitimate government , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said .
eu and us support for the government of prime minister salam fayyad was " an attempt to manipulate the palestinian people and distance it from hamas , " he charged , adding that the strategy would not work .
hamas is not alone in its criticism of the west .
" the international community shares the guilt for the escalation in the middle east , " said udo steinbach , director of the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
hamastan and fatahstan after months of fighting , hamas and fatah had agreed in february to set up a joint government , with saudi arabia acting as a mediator and bringing the two groups together in a symbolic mecca meeting .
meanwhile , the united states backed fatah by providing security training and arms , and israel froze palestinian tax funds for fear that hamas would use the money to finance terror attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian in-fighting pushes peace with israel further into the realm of the unimaginable " by turning against hamas , the united states and israel delegitimated the saudi attempts to mediate , " steinbach said .
the result was politically divided palestinian territories , derisively called " hamastan " and " fatahstan . "
the us has pushed for movement in the israel-palestinian conflict to curry favor with moderate islamic countries , such as syria and jordan , which washington wants as allies against iran 's nuclear ambitions .
at the same time , arab states also use the conflict to further their own foreign policy agendas , with syria and iran presumably supporting hamas with weapons and funding .
but the arab states also pursue differing aims .
" we do n't only have a clash of cultures , but also a conflict between sunnis and shiites within islam , " political scientist christian hacke of the university of bonn pointed out .
germany fails as eu president germany , too - which since january has held the rotating eu presidency - has failed to lead the way .
" the german eu council presidency was weak when it came to middle east policy , " steinbach said .
it did n't help to find a way for the region to get beyond the impasse , he said .
" for peace between israelis and palestinians , there needs to be a clear plan as to where things should go , " he added .

" i hope that we will achieve a compromise which should be arrived at easily and that we will not be forced to exercise our veto right , " polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski said during a joint news conference .
invited to the mini-summit , portuguese prime minister jose socrates expressed concern that the eu 's 27-member summit in brussels on thursday and friday could fail .
all of eu requires breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveys shows that a majority of poles would accept the eu reforms as presented " europe needs a compromise , " socrates told reporters .
" a failure would mean that all of us would lose . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier agreed with socrates , saying all eu members would lose out if they ca n't reach a deal at this week 's summit .
" if there is no compromise , no agreement to be reached at the council later this week , everyone will have lost - the european union and each and every member country , " he said .
portugal , which takes over the eu rotating presidency on july 1 , was invited to the bratislava meeting , and socrates indicated he would try to persuade euroskeptic countries like poland to back a breakthrough deal on the eu 's future functioning .
continuing uncertainty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said eu voting reforms would lessen warsaw 's influence agreement on the sorely-needed reform package could end two years of political uncertainty sparked by the failure of the eu 's constitution , which was rejected in french and dutch referendums in 2005 .
some observers have said if poland vetoes the reforms that political uncertainty would continue .
poland wants changes to the system of national voting powers at the heart of eu decision-making .
the proposed voting system is skewed in favor of countries with large populations , like germany , according to polish president kaczynski .
" it is not possible that the vote of a citizen in one country may have twice the weight of that from another country , " he said .
" this is very important for the future ; we have to continue with this fight .
" often , in the past , people have fought for things and only history has proved them right , " he said , warning that eu countries should not be split into " good " and " bad " or " obedient " and " disobedient " members .
half-hearted czech support the czech republic is backing poland 's stand and a dutch proposal to boost national parliament 's powers to supervise the eu 's legislative proceedings .
polish foreign minister anna fotyga said warsaw had received signals of a possible compromise but told reporters : " i want to say explicitly that for poland to accept the voting system in the european constitution is not a compromise . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said it does n't want to stop the eu but would not agree to a compromise at any price hungary and slovakia support efforts led by germany , the current eu president , to breathe new life into a proposed european constitution which has been on ice since it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
" the slovak government will not support changes which go against the agreements already concluded within the framework of the constitutional treaty , " slovak prime minister robert fico said .
" the eu should stop being preoccupied with itself and turn as soon as possible to issues which are important for everyday society . "
extended talks possible the hungarian and slovak parliaments ratified the now mothballed constitution , along with 16 other member states , while the czech republic and poland indefinitely postponed discussion of the constitution .
germany admitted it realized that despite narrowing differences on some issues , " it 's also clear that there are still some very serious problems to solve , " said government spokesman ulrich wilhelm , who - predicting a hot and drawn-out summit - advised reporters to pack a third shirt as debate could last longer than the two-day summit originally scheduled . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal will see minimum wage protections extended beyond construction workers and building cleaners to another 10 to 12 industrial sectors .
merkel also brokered an agreement on raising mandatory contributions to statutory nursing care , costs which are shared by workers and employers , by 0.25 percent as of july 2008 while lowering unemployment insurance payments by 0.3 percent to 3.9 percent beginning in january . coalition in position to govern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only construction workers and cleaning people were covered by a minimum wage " i think that the coalition has shown that it is capable of solving problems , " christian democratic union parliamentary group leader volker kauder said tuesday . edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , the cdu bavarian sister party , said the compromise represented " a whole series of improvements . " " for us it was clear that there would not be a statutory minimum wage , " stoiber said , adding that the deal reached showed " even when the starting points are very far from each other , the grand coalition can succeed at coming to an outcome . " but members of the spd , who recent polls have shown to be trailing their coalition partners by nearly 10 percent , said the minimum wage deal , for which the social democrats have long pushed and the cdu has bitterly opposed , does not go far enough . debate to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition was not able to reach agreement on ending the post 's letter delivery monopoly " it is in no way a major breakthrough , " spd labor policy expert klaus brander told public broadcaster zdf , adding that a general minimum wage would have been of greater benefit to german workers . spd party head kurt beck said the debate over a minimum wage had not ended , adding that " the political discussion will continue . " germans seem largely in favor of a minimum wage , according to an emnid poll showing that 60 percent of germans were for the idea , with conservative voters also supporting the initiative . the iw cologne research institute said that if a 7.50 euro -lrb- $ 10.00 -rrb- minimum wage were adopted , more than 1 million jobs could be lost to under the table work , meaning less tax income for the government and social security contributions . europe 's largest economy , germany has recently experienced an economic improvement and dropped its unemployment rate from 12 percent in early 2006 to 9.1 percent . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 19.06.2007 putin wins journalists ' ' prize ' as press freedom opponent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independent journalists have a hard time getting comments out of russian president putin staying tightlipped can pay off if you 're running for the " closed oyster " trophy - a satirical recognition of the opponents of free press .
this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him . " putin is a flawless example of an opponent of freedom of the press and expression , " netzwerk recherche head thomas leif said in his award speech this weekend in hamburg . " when the protection and guarantee of freedom of the press are concerned , putin follows principles closer to those of a dictatorship than of a democracy . " no reaction from russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : say what i want to hear and i 'll be glad to talk with you putin is the first non-german to receive the award which has been given out since 2002 .
the journalists ' organization , however , has not received a reply as to whether putin or russia 's ambassador to germany will be present to accept the award personally , according thomas schuler , a member of the organization 's executive board . there was plenty of reason for the group , which was formed in 2001 , to choose putin to receive this year 's award , schuler said , adding that netzwerk recherche counted 14 journalists who had been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances since putin came to power in 2000 .
none of the murders has been solved . " these murders and cases of journalists being persecuted have created a climate in russia that does not allow for criticism or debate , " schuler said .
" it 's a climate where self-censorship rules instead of freedom of expression .
netzwerk recherche is of the opinion that putin is responsible for this system . " reporters risking their lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in st. petersburg turned violent with journalists and other civilians being beaten and arrested oleg panfilov , who heads moscow 's center for journalism in extreme situations , also said putin deserved the award , adding that journalists who do not accept the official kremlin line are putting their physical well-being at risk . " independent journalists are constantly under pressure , " panfilov said .
" the reporters who do not let the state tame them are threatened at first , then beat up and sometimes even murdered . " the new york-based committee to protect journalists has named russia the third most dangerous place for reporters to work after iraq and algeria over the last 15 years . independent journalists and news outlets in russia must also spend time and money defending themselves from lawsuits they can not win because the courts side with the government , panfilov said . sign of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the cases of killed journalists , including that of anna politkovskaya , has been solved stephan stuchlik , a moscow television correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he saw just how much pressure reporters in russia are under while covering april opposition demonstrations in st. petersburg . " i got several elbows to the face and kicks in the stomach , " said stuchlik , who was taken into custody for filming the protests .

this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him . " putin is a flawless example of an opponent of freedom of the press and expression , " netzwerk recherche head thomas leif said in his award speech this weekend in hamburg . " when the protection and guarantee of freedom of the press are concerned , putin follows principles closer to those of a dictatorship than of a democracy . " no reaction from russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : say what i want to hear and i 'll be glad to talk with you putin is the first non-german to receive the award which has been given out since 2002 .
the journalists ' organization , however , has not received a reply as to whether putin or russia 's ambassador to germany will be present to accept the award personally , according thomas schuler , a member of the organization 's executive board . there was plenty of reason for the group , which was formed in 2001 , to choose putin to receive this year 's award , schuler said , adding that netzwerk recherche counted 14 journalists who had been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances since putin came to power in 2000 .
none of the murders has been solved . " these murders and cases of journalists being persecuted have created a climate in russia that does not allow for criticism or debate , " schuler said .
" it 's a climate where self-censorship rules instead of freedom of expression .
netzwerk recherche is of the opinion that putin is responsible for this system . " reporters risking their lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in st. petersburg turned violent with journalists and other civilians being beaten and arrested oleg panfilov , who heads moscow 's center for journalism in extreme situations , also said putin deserved the award , adding that journalists who do not accept the official kremlin line are putting their physical well-being at risk . " independent journalists are constantly under pressure , " panfilov said .
" the reporters who do not let the state tame them are threatened at first , then beat up and sometimes even murdered . " the new york-based committee to protect journalists has named russia the third most dangerous place for reporters to work after iraq and algeria over the last 15 years . independent journalists and news outlets in russia must also spend time and money defending themselves from lawsuits they can not win because the courts side with the government , panfilov said . sign of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the cases of killed journalists , including that of anna politkovskaya , has been solved stephan stuchlik , a moscow television correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he saw just how much pressure reporters in russia are under while covering april opposition demonstrations in st. petersburg .

the rarely played piece was performed from 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- above ground this week . musicians johannes denhoff , luciana duta , zazie lewandowski and karl huros of braunschweig 's staatstheater climbed into helicopters and put their instruments to work on sunday to make the performance of contemporary composer karlheinz stockhausen 's " helicopter string quartet " a success .
" when you 're up above in the air , it is truly a feeling of euphoria , " denhoff told german news agency dpa .
" you feel like you 're part of a work of art . "
the " helicopter string quartet " consists of four helicopters and as many musicians .
the participants play from inside the hovering crafts .
the combined sound of the instruments and the helicopters make up the piece , which is part of a 29-hour work called " light cycle . "
audience crucial to success the concert of rotors and strings was broadcast in a hangar from which the helicopters took off .
once the helicopters reached the altitude of 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- and were visible only as small specks in the sky , the hangar doors closed and the audience turned to the four large screens on which they could follow the individual musicians .

the rarely played piece was performed from 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- above ground this week . musicians johannes denhoff , luciana duta , zazie lewandowski and karl huros of braunschweig 's staatstheater climbed into helicopters and put their instruments to work on sunday to make the performance of contemporary composer karlheinz stockhausen 's " helicopter string quartet " a success .
" when you 're up above in the air , it is truly a feeling of euphoria , " denhoff told german news agency dpa .
" you feel like you 're part of a work of art . "
the " helicopter string quartet " consists of four helicopters and as many musicians .
the participants play from inside the hovering crafts .
the combined sound of the instruments and the helicopters make up the piece , which is part of a 29-hour work called " light cycle . "
audience crucial to success the concert of rotors and strings was broadcast in a hangar from which the helicopters took off .
once the helicopters reached the altitude of 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- and were visible only as small specks in the sky , the hangar doors closed and the audience turned to the four large screens on which they could follow the individual musicians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parity between man and machine ?

this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him . " putin is a flawless example of an opponent of freedom of the press and expression , " netzwerk recherche head thomas leif said in his award speech this weekend in hamburg . " when the protection and guarantee of freedom of the press are concerned , putin follows principles closer to those of a dictatorship than of a democracy . " no reaction from russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : say what i want to hear and i 'll be glad to talk with you putin is the first non-german to receive the award which has been given out since 2002 .
the journalists ' organization , however , has not received a reply as to whether putin or russia 's ambassador to germany will be present to accept the award personally , according thomas schuler , a member of the organization 's executive board . there was plenty of reason for the group , which was formed in 2001 , to choose putin to receive this year 's award , schuler said , adding that netzwerk recherche counted 14 journalists who had been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances since putin came to power in 2000 .
none of the murders has been solved . " these murders and cases of journalists being persecuted have created a climate in russia that does not allow for criticism or debate , " schuler said .
" it 's a climate where self-censorship rules instead of freedom of expression .
netzwerk recherche is of the opinion that putin is responsible for this system . " reporters risking their lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in st. petersburg turned violent with journalists and other civilians being beaten and arrested oleg panfilov , who heads moscow 's center for journalism in extreme situations , also said putin deserved the award , adding that journalists who do not accept the official kremlin line are putting their physical well-being at risk . " independent journalists are constantly under pressure , " panfilov said .
" the reporters who do not let the state tame them are threatened at first , then beat up and sometimes even murdered . " the new york-based committee to protect journalists has named russia the third most dangerous place for reporters to work after iraq and algeria over the last 15 years . independent journalists and news outlets in russia must also spend time and money defending themselves from lawsuits they can not win because the courts side with the government , panfilov said . sign of solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the cases of killed journalists , including that of anna politkovskaya , has been solved stephan stuchlik , a moscow television correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he saw just how much pressure reporters in russia are under while covering april opposition demonstrations in st. petersburg . " i got several elbows to the face and kicks in the stomach , " said stuchlik , who was taken into custody for filming the protests .
" i got the impression at the st. petersburg event that the direction was being given by the kremlin .
that it 's not such a big deal if a journalist gets beat up .

the deal will see minimum wage protections extended beyond construction workers and building cleaners to another 10 to 12 industrial sectors .
merkel also brokered an agreement on raising mandatory contributions to statutory nursing care , costs which are shared by workers and employers , by 0.25 percent as of july 2008 while lowering unemployment insurance payments by 0.3 percent to 3.9 percent beginning in january . coalition in position to govern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only construction workers and cleaning people were covered by a minimum wage " i think that the coalition has shown that it is capable of solving problems , " christian democratic union parliamentary group leader volker kauder said tuesday . edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , the cdu bavarian sister party , said the compromise represented " a whole series of improvements . " " for us it was clear that there would not be a statutory minimum wage , " stoiber said , adding that the deal reached showed " even when the starting points are very far from each other , the grand coalition can succeed at coming to an outcome . " but members of the spd , who recent polls have shown to be trailing their coalition partners by nearly 10 percent , said the minimum wage deal , for which the social democrats have long pushed and the cdu has bitterly opposed , does not go far enough . debate to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition was not able to reach agreement on ending the post 's letter delivery monopoly " it is in no way a major breakthrough , " spd labor policy expert klaus brander told public broadcaster zdf , adding that a general minimum wage would have been of greater benefit to german workers . spd party head kurt beck said the debate over a minimum wage had not ended , adding that " the political discussion will continue . " germans seem largely in favor of a minimum wage , according to an emnid poll showing that 60 percent of germans were for the idea , with conservative voters also supporting the initiative . the iw cologne research institute said that if a 7.50 euro -lrb- $ 10.00 -rrb- minimum wage were adopted , more than 1 million jobs could be lost to under the table work , meaning less tax income for the government and social security contributions . europe 's largest economy , germany has recently experienced an economic improvement and dropped its unemployment rate from 12 percent in early 2006 to 9.1 percent . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , the prize went to russian president vladimir putin . the russian president received the annual award from netzwerk recherche , a network of german investigative journalists , for his ability to remain taciturn whenever a microphone is put in front of him . " putin is a flawless example of an opponent of freedom of the press and expression , " netzwerk recherche head thomas leif said in his award speech this weekend in hamburg . " when the protection and guarantee of freedom of the press are concerned , putin follows principles closer to those of a dictatorship than of a democracy . " no reaction from russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : say what i want to hear and i 'll be glad to talk with you putin is the first non-german to receive the award which has been given out since 2002 .
the journalists ' organization , however , has not received a reply as to whether putin or russia 's ambassador to germany will be present to accept the award personally , according thomas schuler , a member of the organization 's executive board . there was plenty of reason for the group , which was formed in 2001 , to choose putin to receive this year 's award , schuler said , adding that netzwerk recherche counted 14 journalists who had been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances since putin came to power in 2000 .
none of the murders has been solved . " these murders and cases of journalists being persecuted have created a climate in russia that does not allow for criticism or debate , " schuler said .
" it 's a climate where self-censorship rules instead of freedom of expression .
netzwerk recherche is of the opinion that putin is responsible for this system . " reporters risking their lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in st. petersburg turned violent with journalists and other civilians being beaten and arrested oleg panfilov , who heads moscow 's center for journalism in extreme situations , also said putin deserved the award , adding that journalists who do not accept the official kremlin line are putting their physical well-being at risk .

the deal will see minimum wage protections extended beyond construction workers and building cleaners to another 10 to 12 industrial sectors .

the rarely played piece was performed from 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- above ground this week . musicians johannes denhoff , luciana duta , zazie lewandowski and karl huros of braunschweig 's staatstheater climbed into helicopters and put their instruments to work on sunday to make the performance of contemporary composer karlheinz stockhausen 's " helicopter string quartet " a success .
" when you 're up above in the air , it is truly a feeling of euphoria , " denhoff told german news agency dpa .
" you feel like you 're part of a work of art . "
the " helicopter string quartet " consists of four helicopters and as many musicians .
the participants play from inside the hovering crafts .
the combined sound of the instruments and the helicopters make up the piece , which is part of a 29-hour work called " light cycle . "
audience crucial to success the concert of rotors and strings was broadcast in a hangar from which the helicopters took off .
once the helicopters reached the altitude of 700 meters -lrb- 2,300 feet -rrb- and were visible only as small specks in the sky , the hangar doors closed and the audience turned to the four large screens on which they could follow the individual musicians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parity between man and machine ?
the braunschweig performance was only the third successful one ever .
the composer himself set the bar high as to what can be deemed acceptable performance : the helicopters must lift off three times within one day and have a new audience for each round .
all together , around 1,100 people watched the spectacle , according to the organizers .
technical feat " that was an extreme technical challenge , " admitted sound engineer olaf mielke , adding that the performance had been almost perfect , save one minor hiccup .
the piece was put on by the city of braunschweig , which currently holds the title " city of science 2007 , " and a contemporary music festival .
it cost around 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 173,000 -rrb- , 70,000 of which was paid for by the city .

european voters place german chancellor angela merkel first when it comes to taking on a strong leadership role in european union , according to a new study released on tuesday . twenty-eight percent of the electorate in europe believes german chancellor angela merkel should assume a strong leadership role in the european union .
this puts her a long way ahead of other european politicians , according the survey conducted by germany 's bertelsmann foundation in 14 of the eu 's 27 members states .
some 47 percent of the 13,840 persons questioned felt the eu needs politicians capable of providing greater political leadership , while 32 percent said they did not believe there was a leadership deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose barroso following merkel in terms of popularity was european commission president jose barroso on 20 percent .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy achieved 15 percent , followed by british prime minister designate gordon brown with 14 percent .
home support the german chancellor 's popularity was highest in her native country , where she scored 58 percent .
in france 36 percent of those interviewed hoped she would assume a strong leadership role .
but she scored only 17 percent in germany 's neighbor poland and came bottom with 11 percent in britain , according to the survey which was conducted in may and june .
the chancellor faces a major test later this week when she seeks to persuade eu leaders to agree on a new treaty to replace the bloc 's draft constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .

european voters place german chancellor angela merkel first when it comes to taking on a strong leadership role in european union , according to a new study released on tuesday . twenty-eight percent of the electorate in europe believes german chancellor angela merkel should assume a strong leadership role in the european union .
this puts her a long way ahead of other european politicians , according the survey conducted by germany 's bertelsmann foundation in 14 of the eu 's 27 members states .
some 47 percent of the 13,840 persons questioned felt the eu needs politicians capable of providing greater political leadership , while 32 percent said they did not believe there was a leadership deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose barroso following merkel in terms of popularity was european commission president jose barroso on 20 percent .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy achieved 15 percent , followed by british prime minister designate gordon brown with 14 percent .
home support the german chancellor 's popularity was highest in her native country , where she scored 58 percent .
in france 36 percent of those interviewed hoped she would assume a strong leadership role .
but she scored only 17 percent in germany 's neighbor poland and came bottom with 11 percent in britain , according to the survey which was conducted in may and june .
the chancellor faces a major test later this week when she seeks to persuade eu leaders to agree on a new treaty to replace the bloc 's draft constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
facing opponents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel be able to charm poland 's kaczynski ?
poland and britain have raised objections to the revised draft that merkel will present to a summit in brussels on june 21-22 , shortly before germany 's term as rotating eu present expires at the end of the month .
poland has threatened to block approval because it objects to the draft 's weighted voting system which it says gives unfair advantage to large countries like germany at warsaw 's expense .
britain is opposed to the role of an eu foreign minister mentioned in the draft and is also unhappy about the charter of fundamental rights laying down civic entitlements for all europeans . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .
it 's targeting a specific group - western german retirees . in several cities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , some senior citizens walking in shopping areas have had small packets pressed into their hands .
they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .
" it 's simple , " said siegfried gallitschke , a project manager at the city-owned lbw , leipzig 's biggest landlord .
" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "
the project to pull the grey set eastwards came after lbw looked at its tenant rolls , and the big blank spots on them .
the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .
while there has been a net increase in the number of people moving to leipzig since at least 2002 , there have not been enough new arrivals to fill all the vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's city hall so lbw decided to do some targeted marketing .
it could not offer much to young professionals , since jobs in leipzig are in short supply .
the city 's unemployment rate currently stands at 17.1 percent .
it could , however , offer something to seniors , who are ready - even in the autumn of life , for a new adventure .
" seniors are very flexible , " said gallitschke , who came up with the seniors idea .
" they do n't need jobs , they do n't have children who are in school , and many would like to move to a new city . "
cost of living the big selling point , however , is money .
according to gallitschke , seniors willing to move east can save up to 20 percent on monthly rent .
their living expenses overall are cheaper , he added , and leipzig offers an abundance of affordable cultural activities as well as a surrounding countryside full of lakes - ideal for day trips .
gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .
around 400 seniors have contacted lbw about the campaign and two bus trips set up for july to bring seniors east for a tour of their potential new home have sold out .
another is scheduled for september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 20,000 empty apartments in leipzig those interested fall into roughly three groups : there are those who once may have lived in leipzig and want to return to their roots ; others whose children have moved east for work and who want to be close to them ; and a third group of people who no longer have family ties where they live now and are free to do as they please .
" they are n't tied down , " gallitschke said .
" we offer them the room , they design their new freedom . "
purchasing power germany 's population is graying .
the country 's birthrate is one of europe 's lowest , around 1.4 women per child , and the percentage of the population over 65 years of age continues to climb .
demographers from the berlin institute for world population and global development have calculated that by 2020 , between 25 and 36 percent of the population will be older than 60 , depending on region .
" that means you have fewer consumers overall , fewer producers , fewer inventors and so on , " said reinhold klingholz , director of the institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the purchasing power of the senior demographic is getting stronger but lbw prefers to see the silver lining in this silver generation , at least in the short term .
retirees have steady , secure incomes and , with their growing numbers , are a growing force in the economy .
leipzig could profit from the influx of the aged .
" in germany , it 's becoming clearer that the buying power of this group is especially strong , " said lisa neuendorfer , a marketing analyst who specializes in age issues at the research firm ifak .
" for every company that offers a product or a service , it 's a very important group , because it has money . "
not happy not everyone is happy about leipzig 's attempt to tempt seniors into leaving their homes and heading east .
local politicians in the target cities in the west are " reacting kind of strangely , " according to lbm 's gallitschke .
indeed , a spokesman from the city of remscheid told the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he is amazed that leipzig would spend money on a project like this .
" the campaign is n't exactly going to help improve the relationship between the two cities , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .
it 's targeting a specific group - western german retirees . in several cities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , some senior citizens walking in shopping areas have had small packets pressed into their hands .
they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .
" it 's simple , " said siegfried gallitschke , a project manager at the city-owned lbw , leipzig 's biggest landlord .
" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "
the project to pull the grey set eastwards came after lbw looked at its tenant rolls , and the big blank spots on them .
the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .
while there has been a net increase in the number of people moving to leipzig since at least 2002 , there have not been enough new arrivals to fill all the vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's city hall so lbw decided to do some targeted marketing .
it could not offer much to young professionals , since jobs in leipzig are in short supply .
the city 's unemployment rate currently stands at 17.1 percent .
it could , however , offer something to seniors , who are ready - even in the autumn of life , for a new adventure .
" seniors are very flexible , " said gallitschke , who came up with the seniors idea .
" they do n't need jobs , they do n't have children who are in school , and many would like to move to a new city . "
cost of living the big selling point , however , is money .
according to gallitschke , seniors willing to move east can save up to 20 percent on monthly rent .
their living expenses overall are cheaper , he added , and leipzig offers an abundance of affordable cultural activities as well as a surrounding countryside full of lakes - ideal for day trips .
gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .
around 400 seniors have contacted lbw about the campaign and two bus trips set up for july to bring seniors east for a tour of their potential new home have sold out .
another is scheduled for september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 20,000 empty apartments in leipzig those interested fall into roughly three groups : there are those who once may have lived in leipzig and want to return to their roots ; others whose children have moved east for work and who want to be close to them ; and a third group of people who no longer have family ties where they live now and are free to do as they please .
" they are n't tied down , " gallitschke said .

purchasing power germany 's population is graying .
the country 's birthrate is one of europe 's lowest , around 1.4 women per child , and the percentage of the population over 65 years of age continues to climb .
demographers from the berlin institute for world population and global development have calculated that by 2020 , between 25 and 36 percent of the population will be older than 60 , depending on region .

to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .
it 's targeting a specific group - western german retirees . in several cities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , some senior citizens walking in shopping areas have had small packets pressed into their hands .
they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .
" it 's simple , " said siegfried gallitschke , a project manager at the city-owned lbw , leipzig 's biggest landlord .
" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "
the project to pull the grey set eastwards came after lbw looked at its tenant rolls , and the big blank spots on them .
the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .
while there has been a net increase in the number of people moving to leipzig since at least 2002 , there have not been enough new arrivals to fill all the vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's city hall so lbw decided to do some targeted marketing .
it could not offer much to young professionals , since jobs in leipzig are in short supply .
the city 's unemployment rate currently stands at 17.1 percent .
it could , however , offer something to seniors , who are ready - even in the autumn of life , for a new adventure .
" seniors are very flexible , " said gallitschke , who came up with the seniors idea .
" they do n't need jobs , they do n't have children who are in school , and many would like to move to a new city . "
cost of living the big selling point , however , is money .
according to gallitschke , seniors willing to move east can save up to 20 percent on monthly rent .
their living expenses overall are cheaper , he added , and leipzig offers an abundance of affordable cultural activities as well as a surrounding countryside full of lakes - ideal for day trips .
gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .
around 400 seniors have contacted lbw about the campaign and two bus trips set up for july to bring seniors east for a tour of their potential new home have sold out .
another is scheduled for september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 20,000 empty apartments in leipzig those interested fall into roughly three groups : there are those who once may have lived in leipzig and want to return to their roots ; others whose children have moved east for work and who want to be close to them ; and a third group of people who no longer have family ties where they live now and are free to do as they please .

the country 's birthrate is one of europe 's lowest , around 1.4 women per child , and the percentage of the population over 65 years of age continues to climb .
demographers from the berlin institute for world population and global development have calculated that by 2020 , between 25 and 36 percent of the population will be older than 60 , depending on region .
" that means you have fewer consumers overall , fewer producers , fewer inventors and so on , " said reinhold klingholz , director of the institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the purchasing power of the senior demographic is getting stronger but lbw prefers to see the silver lining in this silver generation , at least in the short term .
retirees have steady , secure incomes and , with their growing numbers , are a growing force in the economy .
leipzig could profit from the influx of the aged .
" in germany , it 's becoming clearer that the buying power of this group is especially strong , " said lisa neuendorfer , a marketing analyst who specializes in age issues at the research firm ifak .

the most important thing was to convince people that open borders were not something dangerous , schäuble said after a meeting with his czech republic counterpart ivan langer in berlin .
langer said he was convinced that security would not deteriorate after the borders were opened , pointing to improved cooperation between national police forces under the schengen information system .

all except norway and iceland are european union members .
nine of the 10 countries that joined the eu in its " big bang " expansion in 2004 will be eligible to join at the end of the year .
they are poland , the czech republic , hungary , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , latvia , lithuania and malta .
cyprus , the 10th country , will not be joining .

more countries joined the treaty over the years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 19.06.2007 go east , senior citizen ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are they considering a move to leipzig ?
to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .
it 's targeting a specific group - western german retirees . in several cities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , some senior citizens walking in shopping areas have had small packets pressed into their hands .
they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .
" it 's simple , " said siegfried gallitschke , a project manager at the city-owned lbw , leipzig 's biggest landlord .
" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "
the project to pull the grey set eastwards came after lbw looked at its tenant rolls , and the big blank spots on them .
the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .
while there has been a net increase in the number of people moving to leipzig since at least 2002 , there have not been enough new arrivals to fill all the vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's city hall so lbw decided to do some targeted marketing .
it could not offer much to young professionals , since jobs in leipzig are in short supply .
the city 's unemployment rate currently stands at 17.1 percent .
it could , however , offer something to seniors , who are ready - even in the autumn of life , for a new adventure .
" seniors are very flexible , " said gallitschke , who came up with the seniors idea .
" they do n't need jobs , they do n't have children who are in school , and many would like to move to a new city . "
cost of living the big selling point , however , is money .
according to gallitschke , seniors willing to move east can save up to 20 percent on monthly rent .
their living expenses overall are cheaper , he added , and leipzig offers an abundance of affordable cultural activities as well as a surrounding countryside full of lakes - ideal for day trips .
gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .
around 400 seniors have contacted lbw about the campaign and two bus trips set up for july to bring seniors east for a tour of their potential new home have sold out .
another is scheduled for september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 20,000 empty apartments in leipzig those interested fall into roughly three groups : there are those who once may have lived in leipzig and want to return to their roots ; others whose children have moved east for work and who want to be close to them ; and a third group of people who no longer have family ties where they live now and are free to do as they please .
" they are n't tied down , " gallitschke said .
" we offer them the room , they design their new freedom . "
purchasing power germany 's population is graying .
the country 's birthrate is one of europe 's lowest , around 1.4 women per child , and the percentage of the population over 65 years of age continues to climb .
demographers from the berlin institute for world population and global development have calculated that by 2020 , between 25 and 36 percent of the population will be older than 60 , depending on region .
" that means you have fewer consumers overall , fewer producers , fewer inventors and so on , " said reinhold klingholz , director of the institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the purchasing power of the senior demographic is getting stronger but lbw prefers to see the silver lining in this silver generation , at least in the short term .
retirees have steady , secure incomes and , with their growing numbers , are a growing force in the economy .
leipzig could profit from the influx of the aged .
" in germany , it 's becoming clearer that the buying power of this group is especially strong , " said lisa neuendorfer , a marketing analyst who specializes in age issues at the research firm ifak .
" for every company that offers a product or a service , it 's a very important group , because it has money . "
not happy not everyone is happy about leipzig 's attempt to tempt seniors into leaving their homes and heading east .
local politicians in the target cities in the west are " reacting kind of strangely , " according to lbm 's gallitschke .
indeed , a spokesman from the city of remscheid told the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he is amazed that leipzig would spend money on a project like this .
" the campaign is n't exactly going to help improve the relationship between the two cities , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to find occupants for some of its 20,000 empty apartments , the eastern german city of leipzig is on a tenant-finding mission .
it 's targeting a specific group - western german retirees . in several cities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , some senior citizens walking in shopping areas have had small packets pressed into their hands .
they looked like the small boxes that medication often comes in .
but these contained no free aspirin for arthritic hands or pills for aging hearts , rather they had information about a new program to entice older people to pack up their belongings and move east , to the city of leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony .
" it 's simple , " said siegfried gallitschke , a project manager at the city-owned lbw , leipzig 's biggest landlord .
" we offer them low-priced living , lower than they can have in the west . "
the project to pull the grey set eastwards came after lbw looked at its tenant rolls , and the big blank spots on them .
the company has some 20,000 empty apartments on its hands .
after the fall of the wall , a collapsing economy in eastern german led to a mass exodus from the city , and a resulting high vacancy rate .
while there has been a net increase in the number of people moving to leipzig since at least 2002 , there have not been enough new arrivals to fill all the vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's city hall so lbw decided to do some targeted marketing .
it could not offer much to young professionals , since jobs in leipzig are in short supply .
the city 's unemployment rate currently stands at 17.1 percent .
it could , however , offer something to seniors , who are ready - even in the autumn of life , for a new adventure .
" seniors are very flexible , " said gallitschke , who came up with the seniors idea .
" they do n't need jobs , they do n't have children who are in school , and many would like to move to a new city . "
cost of living the big selling point , however , is money .
according to gallitschke , seniors willing to move east can save up to 20 percent on monthly rent .
their living expenses overall are cheaper , he added , and leipzig offers an abundance of affordable cultural activities as well as a surrounding countryside full of lakes - ideal for day trips .
gallitschke said the new campaign to bring seniors east has raised a good deal of interest in the three cities in north rhine-westphalia where it has been unrolled - wuppertal , remscheid and duisburg .
around 400 seniors have contacted lbw about the campaign and two bus trips set up for july to bring seniors east for a tour of their potential new home have sold out .
another is scheduled for september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 20,000 empty apartments in leipzig those interested fall into roughly three groups : there are those who once may have lived in leipzig and want to return to their roots ; others whose children have moved east for work and who want to be close to them ; and a third group of people who no longer have family ties where they live now and are free to do as they please .
" they are n't tied down , " gallitschke said .
" we offer them the room , they design their new freedom . "
purchasing power germany 's population is graying .
the country 's birthrate is one of europe 's lowest , around 1.4 women per child , and the percentage of the population over 65 years of age continues to climb .
demographers from the berlin institute for world population and global development have calculated that by 2020 , between 25 and 36 percent of the population will be older than 60 , depending on region .
" that means you have fewer consumers overall , fewer producers , fewer inventors and so on , " said reinhold klingholz , director of the institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the purchasing power of the senior demographic is getting stronger but lbw prefers to see the silver lining in this silver generation , at least in the short term .
retirees have steady , secure incomes and , with their growing numbers , are a growing force in the economy .
leipzig could profit from the influx of the aged .
" in germany , it 's becoming clearer that the buying power of this group is especially strong , " said lisa neuendorfer , a marketing analyst who specializes in age issues at the research firm ifak .
" for every company that offers a product or a service , it 's a very important group , because it has money . "
not happy not everyone is happy about leipzig 's attempt to tempt seniors into leaving their homes and heading east .
local politicians in the target cities in the west are " reacting kind of strangely , " according to lbm 's gallitschke .
indeed , a spokesman from the city of remscheid told the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he is amazed that leipzig would spend money on a project like this .
" the campaign is n't exactly going to help improve the relationship between the two cities , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.06.2007 eu parliament votes to ban trading in cat and dog fur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission estimated that 2 million cats and dogs are killed for their fur each year european lawmakers moved tuesday to keep fluffy and fido out of clothing and stuffed kids ' toys by prohibiting the trade in cat and dog fur after a voluntary ban was found to be ineffective . european parliamentarians voted in favor of a proposed ban on the trade in cat and dog fur in the 27-nation bloc .
if eu governments also decide to support the european commission 's proposal as expected , the import , export and sale of cat and dog fur , as well as any products containing their fur , will be banned from 2009 .
" the placing on the market and the import and export ... of fur of cats and dogs and products containing fur shall be prohibited , " according to the draft resolution .
the eu executive proposed the legislation after a public outcry when evidence showed cat and dog fur products were still being traded in the bloc despite a voluntary code of conduct prohibiting the practice .
misleading labels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu said dog fur was sold under other names british labor mep arlene mccarthy , who chairs the internal market and consumer protection committee , said many people unwittingly buy garments made with cat and dog fur due to improper labeling .
" the majority of cat and dog fur comes from china , where over 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their furs and skins , " she said .
" at least 10 dogs are slaughtered to make a single coat - more if puppies are used . "
a 2005 study conducted by the australian animal-rights group humane society international estimated that some 5,400 of the animals killed in china each day .
the european commission said the animals ' fur could be found on the european market in clothing , personal accessories and soft toys for children .
the commission added that by forcing member states to test for the fur , the bloc would be able to put together a clearer picture of what products it is used in .
matching international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bans on trading in cat and dog fur are already in place in other countries the parliament 's support for the ban on dog and cat fur has left green party parliamentarians hoping that similar bans could be introduced to protect other animals as well .
" this ban on the trade in cat and dog fur sets an important precedent and should pave the way for banning the trade in products from other animals on animal welfare grounds - notably seal products , " british green euro-deputy caroline lucas said .
the parliamentarians cut out a proposed loophole that would have allowed the trade of cat and dog fur as long was it did not come from animals bred only for their fur .
" the eu is taking an important step towards ending the cruel and brutal way in which these animals are slaughtered for their fur , " said heide rühle , a german green party member of the eu parliament .
" it is high time that a ban on the trade in cat and dog fur was introduced in the eu , with other countries , like the us and australia , having had bans in place for a number of years . "
fur trade group welcomes the decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote does not outlaw all fur trade the international fur trade federation , an industry association whose members already have a voluntary ban in place , also welcomed the parliament 's decision .
" we hope it will be positive for the legitimate fur trade and complement the voluntary ban on cat and dog furs we have been operating for the last five years , " it said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

michelle bennett 's husband paul , whose motor neurone disease left him paralysed and in constant pain , decided to die in a swiss clinic .
in may 2006 mr bennett , of morriston , swansea , travelled to the dignitas clinic in zurich with his family .
however , the royal college of nursing -lrb- rcn -rrb- and british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- oppose assisted dying .
dignitas is a swiss assisted suicide group that helps those with incurable physical and mental illnesses to die with the aid of doctors and nurses .
it was founded in 1998 by the swiss lawyer ludwig minelli and swiss laws on assisted suicide hold that a person who helps someone else kill themselves in this way can be prosecuted only if they are motivated by self-interest .
according to the clinic , 77 people from britain have chosen to die at the clinic and last year the figure was double that of 2005 .
but mrs bennett said even though her husband had no doubts about his decision , he would have preferred to die at home . "
the worst part , because we had to go to switzerland , was to actually leave him there , which was cruel " michelle bennett " i think it 's sad that we ca n't agree for people to end their lives the way people want to , " she said .
" the worst part , because we had to go to switzerland , was to actually leave him there , which was cruel .
" we wanted to take him home but we could n't .
if it was here it would have been so different . "
when the family returned to south wales they faced being questioned by police about his death , but the case was dropped .
" people are going to continue to do this , " mrs bennett said .
peaceful end assisted death is legal in some countries , such as belgium , switzerland and the netherlands , and some doctors believe a change in the law could happen in the uk .
professor john wagstaff , an oncologist in swansea , who helped patients die when he worked in the netherlands , said : he thought britain was closer than ever now to introducing euthanasisa .
" because of the way things have developed in other parts of the world it 's more likely that it will happen , " he said .
" euthanasia is a valuable thing for patients to have , bearing in mind that not everybody will make that decision , " he added .
but recent attempts to change the law have been unsuccessful .
the assisted dying for the terminally ill bill was rejected by the house of lords in may 2006 .
" the majority of the bma at their conference certainly felt it would be wrong for us to go down that road , " said dr tony calland , chair of the bma medical ethics committee .
" doctors have always worked in a patient 's best interests and we believe that bringing about someone 's death deliberately is a significant step away from the best interest position . "
however , from october the mental capacity act will allow people to make a legally binding ' living will ' to refuse medication , artificial food and fluid - even if they will die as a result .
doctors who refuse to carry out a patient 's wishes could face prosecution and some doctors believe it is a step towards euthanasia .
" what concerns me is that the major proponents of living wills are the pro-euthanasia groups , " said dr sarah gwynne , a swansea-based registrar in oncology .
" they see this as the start of patients being able to demand what their doctors do for them .
when we get into the realm of food and fluids we are getting into the area where those boundaries start to blur . "

michelle bennett 's husband paul , whose motor neurone disease left him paralysed and in constant pain , decided to die in a swiss clinic .
in may 2006 mr bennett , of morriston , swansea , travelled to the dignitas clinic in zurich with his family .
however , the royal college of nursing -lrb- rcn -rrb- and british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- oppose assisted dying .
dignitas is a swiss assisted suicide group that helps those with incurable physical and mental illnesses to die with the aid of doctors and nurses .
it was founded in 1998 by the swiss lawyer ludwig minelli and swiss laws on assisted suicide hold that a person who helps someone else kill themselves in this way can be prosecuted only if they are motivated by self-interest .
according to the clinic , 77 people from britain have chosen to die at the clinic and last year the figure was double that of 2005 .
but mrs bennett said even though her husband had no doubts about his decision , he would have preferred to die at home .
the worst part , because we had to go to switzerland , was to actually leave him there , which was cruel michelle bennett " i think it 's sad that we ca n't agree for people to end their lives the way people want to , " she said .
" the worst part , because we had to go to switzerland , was to actually leave him there , which was cruel .
" we wanted to take him home but we could n't .
if it was here it would have been so different . "
when the family returned to south wales they faced being questioned by police about his death , but the case was dropped .
" people are going to continue to do this , " mrs bennett said .
peaceful end assisted death is legal in some countries , such as belgium , switzerland and the netherlands , and some doctors believe a change in the law could happen in the uk .
professor john wagstaff , an oncologist in swansea , who helped patients die when he worked in the netherlands , said : he thought britain was closer than ever now to introducing euthanasisa .
" because of the way things have developed in other parts of the world it 's more likely that it will happen , " he said .
professor john wagstaff has helped patients die " euthanasia is a valuable thing for patients to have , bearing in mind that not everybody will make that decision , " he added .
but recent attempts to change the law have been unsuccessful .
the assisted dying for the terminally ill bill was rejected by the house of lords in may 2006 .
" the majority of the bma at their conference certainly felt it would be wrong for us to go down that road , " said dr tony calland , chair of the bma medical ethics committee .
" doctors have always worked in a patient 's best interests and we believe that bringing about someone 's death deliberately is a significant step away from the best interest position . "
however , from october the mental capacity act will allow people to make a legally binding ' living will ' to refuse medication , artificial food and fluid - even if they will die as a result .
doctors who refuse to carry out a patient 's wishes could face prosecution and some doctors believe it is a step towards euthanasia .
" what concerns me is that the major proponents of living wills are the pro-euthanasia groups , " said dr sarah gwynne , a swansea-based registrar in oncology .
" they see this as the start of patients being able to demand what their doctors do for them .
when we get into the realm of food and fluids we are getting into the area where those boundaries start to blur . "

banaz subsequently disappeared from her south london home in january 2006 and her body was found three months later .
banaz first contacted police on december 4 2005 when she learned of a plot by her uncle to kill her and boyfriend rahmat sulemani , whom the family deemed unsuitable .
when officers went to her home in mitcham to investigate , her mother behya refused to let them in .

the deal came after 14 hours of negotiations and objections from china which threatened to block an agreement .
the council also decided to remove cuba and belarus from a list of countries under special investigation .
the 47-member council , which aims to uphold human rights around the world , was established last year .
compromise correspondents say the last-minute deal prevents the fledgling council , which replaces the discredited human rights commission , from failing to agree on its own governing rules .
" we have all made compromises , it is not a perfect text .
negotiations never achieve a perfect text , " said council president luis alfonso de alba of mexico .
under the " universal periodic review " mechanism , the human rights record of all countries will face regular scrutiny .
china had demanded that two-thirds of the council 's members should agree before any special investigation of alleged rights violations begins .
instead , members agreed that resolutions to investigate specific countries should have " the broadest possible support " before being put forward for approval .
nine countries - including north korea , cambodia and sudan - remain on the council 's list of states meriting special scrutiny .

"
about a year ago i asked my daughter , who was 15 at the time , if she would " add " me as a friend on myspace so i could comment on her profile and be part of her online social network .
she refused point blank .
not because she wanted to keep things secret , but because it would be unutterably naff to have your dad as a myspace friend .
recognising that she was right , i did n't push it .
she knows how to look after herself online - she 's a member of the childnet international children 's ' panel and helps write the guidance for other young people .
but yesterday she added me as a friend on facebook , where she now has a profile too .
not only that , she has admitted in public that she is my daughter .
a brave step indeed .
in fact , i 'm less concerned with her privacy now than i am with my own .
she 's 16 and can look after herself , but now she has access to my online friendship network .
not only will she be able to see who i 'm hanging out with , she 'll also be able to send them all messages .
site seeing this is one of the big problems with facebook , bebo , myspace and the other social network sites .
they bring the many different groups we all belong to into one online space , creating a " social soup " that encourages intermingling when most of us work hard to keep our friends , family and colleagues just a little bit separate , negotiating the boundaries with more or less skill .
the tools used to manage privacy and sharing online remain crude and inflexible compared with the nuanced way we handle real-life social networks , and we are going to have to learn to deal with the new modes of social engagement that result . "
it is the future of user interaction , the way we will manage to take the flat 2d web that we currently experience and turn it into a virtual world " google ranked ' worst ' on privacy although lili is now on facebook , she is adamant that she 'll stay on myspace too , a view that has forced me to revise the model of social network progression i 've put forward in the past .
i used to think that young people would start off in the controlled environment of penguin world or habbo hotel , move to the adolescent chaos that is myspace and then mature into confident facebook users .
but i suspect it will be a lot less clear cut .
for one thing , you ca n't pimp your facebook profile with garish colours , unreadable fonts and appalling backgrounds .
and while facebook offers a " wall " to write comments on , it lacks the directness of a myspace profile .
whether or not she abandons myspace , i do think that facebook will become more important to her simply because it is rapidly becoming more than just a social network site .
its support for third-party applications and services is turning it into a platform for all other forms of online social activity , from talking about movies via the flixster application to asking friends questions or " superpoking " them .
facebook may well become the single point of contact with one 's online networks , wherever they may be hosted .
i rarely visit twitter , the site that lets you send short updates about what you 're up to , because it 's easier to post from within facebook .
and as this trend develops , more and more of us will spend more and more time on facebook instead of elsewhere .
once someone builds " myspacebook " , an application that lets you run your myspace profile from within facebook , the game will be over .
of course , we need to temper our enthusiasm for this connected world .
google was recently criticised by privacy international over its cavalier " trust us , we 're not evil " attitude to personal privacy and user information , and we need to make sure that we are not asking the same questions about facebook in two years ' time .
yet privacy concerns do not bother most of google 's hundreds of millions of users , and they are unlikely to stop facebook 's rapid adoption , so it is worth speculating about where social network sites will go next .
future first one thing that may change significantly is the way we interact with the services .
at the moment , facebook and myspace are page-oriented and text-heavy , but alternatives seem to be emerging .
like many other technology watchers , i 've been captivated recently by a preview release of a new program called photosynth , developed at microsoft live labs .
this astonishing piece of technology gives the lie to the tale that microsoft is unable to innovate effectively and could change the way we think about live online .
photosynth takes a large number of photos of a place or an object , analyses them for similarities , and then stitches them together into a three-dimensional space that allows you to move from photo to photo by clicking , scrolling and panning around in a way which is completely captivating .
it is the future of user interaction , the way we will manage to take the flat 2d web that we currently experience and turn it into a virtual world .
photosynth works with pictures , but pictures are just data and there is no reason i can see why it could not also work with user profiles , web pages , maps or any other form of semi-structured data .
i could navigate my social network as easily as i navigate the collection of photos of the piazza san marco in venice that is provided as one of the demonstrations , or move from web page to web page following a breaking news story .
with facebook as the open social network platform , google offering search , e-mail and applications , and photosynth stitching it all together into one graphical 3d space that we navigate with a mouse or a nintendo wii-like controller , we are moving closer to the model of cyberspace described by william gibson in his 1984 novel neuromancer .
gibson imagined an online world in which large corporations defined rigid hierarchical structures of data like the " stepped scarlet pyramid of the eastern seaboard fission authority " .
by contrast , we could have billions of flickr photos and facebook profiles stitched together into an ever-changing quilt , but the end result would be the " graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system " that he described .
we may be watching on screens instead of having a direct neural input allowing us to " jack in " to the matrix , but it will still be a lot more fun than today 's flat web . "

as facebook opens up it is winning more fans about a year ago i asked my daughter , who was 15 at the time , if she would " add " me as a friend on myspace so i could comment on her profile and be part of her online social network .
she refused point blank .
not because she wanted to keep things secret , but because it would be unutterably naff to have your dad as a myspace friend .
recognising that she was right , i did n't push it .
she knows how to look after herself online - she 's a member of the childnet international children 's ' panel and helps write the guidance for other young people .
but yesterday she added me as a friend on facebook , where she now has a profile too .
not only that , she has admitted in public that she is my daughter .
a brave step indeed .
in fact , i 'm less concerned with her privacy now than i am with my own .
she 's 16 and can look after herself , but now she has access to my online friendship network .
not only will she be able to see who i 'm hanging out with , she 'll also be able to send them all messages .
site seeing this is one of the big problems with facebook , bebo , myspace and the other social network sites .
they bring the many different groups we all belong to into one online space , creating a " social soup " that encourages intermingling when most of us work hard to keep our friends , family and colleagues just a little bit separate , negotiating the boundaries with more or less skill .
the tools used to manage privacy and sharing online remain crude and inflexible compared with the nuanced way we handle real-life social networks , and we are going to have to learn to deal with the new modes of social engagement that result .
it is the future of user interaction , the way we will manage to take the flat 2d web that we currently experience and turn it into a virtual world google ranked ' worst ' on privacy although lili is now on facebook , she is adamant that she 'll stay on myspace too , a view that has forced me to revise the model of social network progression i 've put forward in the past .
i used to think that young people would start off in the controlled environment of penguin world or habbo hotel , move to the adolescent chaos that is myspace and then mature into confident facebook users .
but i suspect it will be a lot less clear cut .
for one thing , you ca n't pimp your facebook profile with garish colours , unreadable fonts and appalling backgrounds .
and while facebook offers a " wall " to write comments on , it lacks the directness of a myspace profile .
whether or not she abandons myspace , i do think that facebook will become more important to her simply because it is rapidly becoming more than just a social network site .
its support for third-party applications and services is turning it into a platform for all other forms of online social activity , from talking about movies via the flixster application to asking friends questions or " superpoking " them .
facebook may well become the single point of contact with one 's online networks , wherever they may be hosted .
i rarely visit twitter , the site that lets you send short updates about what you 're up to , because it 's easier to post from within facebook .
and as this trend develops , more and more of us will spend more and more time on facebook instead of elsewhere .
once someone builds " myspacebook " , an application that lets you run your myspace profile from within facebook , the game will be over .
of course , we need to temper our enthusiasm for this connected world .
google was recently criticised by privacy international over its cavalier " trust us , we 're not evil " attitude to personal privacy and user information , and we need to make sure that we are not asking the same questions about facebook in two years ' time .
yet privacy concerns do not bother most of google 's hundreds of millions of users , and they are unlikely to stop facebook 's rapid adoption , so it is worth speculating about where social network sites will go next .
future first one thing that may change significantly is the way we interact with the services .
at the moment , facebook and myspace are page-oriented and text-heavy , but alternatives seem to be emerging .
like many other technology watchers , i 've been captivated recently by a preview release of a new program called photosynth , developed at microsoft live labs .
there are social network sites for all ages this astonishing piece of technology gives the lie to the tale that microsoft is unable to innovate effectively and could change the way we think about live online .
photosynth takes a large number of photos of a place or an object , analyses them for similarities , and then stitches them together into a three-dimensional space that allows you to move from photo to photo by clicking , scrolling and panning around in a way which is completely captivating .
it is the future of user interaction , the way we will manage to take the flat 2d web that we currently experience and turn it into a virtual world .
photosynth works with pictures , but pictures are just data and there is no reason i can see why it could not also work with user profiles , web pages , maps or any other form of semi-structured data .
i could navigate my social network as easily as i navigate the collection of photos of the piazza san marco in venice that is provided as one of the demonstrations , or move from web page to web page following a breaking news story .
with facebook as the open social network platform , google offering search , e-mail and applications , and photosynth stitching it all together into one graphical 3d space that we navigate with a mouse or a nintendo wii-like controller , we are moving closer to the model of cyberspace described by william gibson in his 1984 novel neuromancer .
gibson imagined an online world in which large corporations defined rigid hierarchical structures of data like the " stepped scarlet pyramid of the eastern seaboard fission authority " .
by contrast , we could have billions of flickr photos and facebook profiles stitched together into an ever-changing quilt , but the end result would be the " graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system " that he described .
we may be watching on screens instead of having a direct neural input allowing us to " jack in " to the matrix , but it will still be a lot more fun than today 's flat web .

as facebook opens up it is winning more fans about a year ago i asked my daughter , who was 15 at the time , if she would " add " me as a friend on myspace so i could comment on her profile and be part of her online social network .
she refused point blank .
not because she wanted to keep things secret , but because it would be unutterably naff to have your dad as a myspace friend .
recognising that she was right , i did n't push it .
she knows how to look after herself online - she 's a member of the childnet international children 's ' panel and helps write the guidance for other young people .
but yesterday she added me as a friend on facebook , where she now has a profile too .
not only that , she has admitted in public that she is my daughter .
a brave step indeed .
in fact , i 'm less concerned with her privacy now than i am with my own .
she 's 16 and can look after herself , but now she has access to my online friendship network .
not only will she be able to see who i 'm hanging out with , she 'll also be able to send them all messages .
site seeing this is one of the big problems with facebook , bebo , myspace and the other social network sites .
they bring the many different groups we all belong to into one online space , creating a " social soup " that encourages intermingling when most of us work hard to keep our friends , family and colleagues just a little bit separate , negotiating the boundaries with more or less skill .
the tools used to manage privacy and sharing online remain crude and inflexible compared with the nuanced way we handle real-life social networks , and we are going to have to learn to deal with the new modes of social engagement that result .
it is the future of user interaction , the way we will manage to take the flat 2d web that we currently experience and turn it into a virtual world google ranked ' worst ' on privacy although lili is now on facebook , she is adamant that she 'll stay on myspace too , a view that has forced me to revise the model of social network progression i 've put forward in the past .
i used to think that young people would start off in the controlled environment of penguin world or habbo hotel , move to the adolescent chaos that is myspace and then mature into confident facebook users .
but i suspect it will be a lot less clear cut .
for one thing , you ca n't pimp your facebook profile with garish colours , unreadable fonts and appalling backgrounds .
and while facebook offers a " wall " to write comments on , it lacks the directness of a myspace profile .
whether or not she abandons myspace , i do think that facebook will become more important to her simply because it is rapidly becoming more than just a social network site .
its support for third-party applications and services is turning it into a platform for all other forms of online social activity , from talking about movies via the flixster application to asking friends questions or " superpoking " them .
facebook may well become the single point of contact with one 's online networks , wherever they may be hosted .
i rarely visit twitter , the site that lets you send short updates about what you 're up to , because it 's easier to post from within facebook .
and as this trend develops , more and more of us will spend more and more time on facebook instead of elsewhere .
once someone builds " myspacebook " , an application that lets you run your myspace profile from within facebook , the game will be over .
of course , we need to temper our enthusiasm for this connected world .
google was recently criticised by privacy international over its cavalier " trust us , we 're not evil " attitude to personal privacy and user information , and we need to make sure that we are not asking the same questions about facebook in two years ' time .
yet privacy concerns do not bother most of google 's hundreds of millions of users , and they are unlikely to stop facebook 's rapid adoption , so it is worth speculating about where social network sites will go next .
future first one thing that may change significantly is the way we interact with the services .
at the moment , facebook and myspace are page-oriented and text-heavy , but alternatives seem to be emerging .
like many other technology watchers , i 've been captivated recently by a preview release of a new program called photosynth , developed at microsoft live labs .
there are social network sites for all ages this astonishing piece of technology gives the lie to the tale that microsoft is unable to innovate effectively and could change the way we think about live online .
photosynth takes a large number of photos of a place or an object , analyses them for similarities , and then stitches them together into a three-dimensional space that allows you to move from photo to photo by clicking , scrolling and panning around in a way which is completely captivating .
it is the future of user interaction , the way we will manage to take the flat 2d web that we currently experience and turn it into a virtual world .
photosynth works with pictures , but pictures are just data and there is no reason i can see why it could not also work with user profiles , web pages , maps or any other form of semi-structured data .
i could navigate my social network as easily as i navigate the collection of photos of the piazza san marco in venice that is provided as one of the demonstrations , or move from web page to web page following a breaking news story .
with facebook as the open social network platform , google offering search , e-mail and applications , and photosynth stitching it all together into one graphical 3d space that we navigate with a mouse or a nintendo wii-like controller , we are moving closer to the model of cyberspace described by william gibson in his 1984 novel neuromancer .
gibson imagined an online world in which large corporations defined rigid hierarchical structures of data like the " stepped scarlet pyramid of the eastern seaboard fission authority " .
by contrast , we could have billions of flickr photos and facebook profiles stitched together into an ever-changing quilt , but the end result would be the " graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system " that he described .
we may be watching on screens instead of having a direct neural input allowing us to " jack in " to the matrix , but it will still be a lot more fun than today 's flat web .

as facebook opens up it is winning more fans about a year ago i asked my daughter , who was 15 at the time , if she would " add " me as a friend on myspace so i could comment on her profile and be part of her online social network .
she refused point blank .
not because she wanted to keep things secret , but because it would be unutterably naff to have your dad as a myspace friend .
recognising that she was right , i did n't push it .
she knows how to look after herself online - she 's a member of the childnet international children 's ' panel and helps write the guidance for other young people .
but yesterday she added me as a friend on facebook , where she now has a profile too .
not only that , she has admitted in public that she is my daughter .
a brave step indeed .
in fact , i 'm less concerned with her privacy now than i am with my own .
she 's 16 and can look after herself , but now she has access to my online friendship network .
not only will she be able to see who i 'm hanging out with , she 'll also be able to send them all messages .
site seeing this is one of the big problems with facebook , bebo , myspace and the other social network sites .
they bring the many different groups we all belong to into one online space , creating a " social soup " that encourages intermingling when most of us work hard to keep our friends , family and colleagues just a little bit separate , negotiating the boundaries with more or less skill .
the tools used to manage privacy and sharing online remain crude and inflexible compared with the nuanced way we handle real-life social networks , and we are going to have to learn to deal with the new modes of social engagement that result .
it is the future of user interaction , the way we will manage to take the flat 2d web that we currently experience and turn it into a virtual world google ranked ' worst ' on privacy although lili is now on facebook , she is adamant that she 'll stay on myspace too , a view that has forced me to revise the model of social network progression i 've put forward in the past .
i used to think that young people would start off in the controlled environment of penguin world or habbo hotel , move to the adolescent chaos that is myspace and then mature into confident facebook users .
but i suspect it will be a lot less clear cut .
for one thing , you ca n't pimp your facebook profile with garish colours , unreadable fonts and appalling backgrounds .
and while facebook offers a " wall " to write comments on , it lacks the directness of a myspace profile .
whether or not she abandons myspace , i do think that facebook will become more important to her simply because it is rapidly becoming more than just a social network site .
its support for third-party applications and services is turning it into a platform for all other forms of online social activity , from talking about movies via the flixster application to asking friends questions or " superpoking " them .
facebook may well become the single point of contact with one 's online networks , wherever they may be hosted .
i rarely visit twitter , the site that lets you send short updates about what you 're up to , because it 's easier to post from within facebook .
and as this trend develops , more and more of us will spend more and more time on facebook instead of elsewhere .
once someone builds " myspacebook " , an application that lets you run your myspace profile from within facebook , the game will be over .
of course , we need to temper our enthusiasm for this connected world .
google was recently criticised by privacy international over its cavalier " trust us , we 're not evil " attitude to personal privacy and user information , and we need to make sure that we are not asking the same questions about facebook in two years ' time .
yet privacy concerns do not bother most of google 's hundreds of millions of users , and they are unlikely to stop facebook 's rapid adoption , so it is worth speculating about where social network sites will go next .
future first one thing that may change significantly is the way we interact with the services .
at the moment , facebook and myspace are page-oriented and text-heavy , but alternatives seem to be emerging .
like many other technology watchers , i 've been captivated recently by a preview release of a new program called photosynth , developed at microsoft live labs .
there are social network sites for all ages this astonishing piece of technology gives the lie to the tale that microsoft is unable to innovate effectively and could change the way we think about live online .
photosynth takes a large number of photos of a place or an object , analyses them for similarities , and then stitches them together into a three-dimensional space that allows you to move from photo to photo by clicking , scrolling and panning around in a way which is completely captivating .
it is the future of user interaction , the way we will manage to take the flat 2d web that we currently experience and turn it into a virtual world .
photosynth works with pictures , but pictures are just data and there is no reason i can see why it could not also work with user profiles , web pages , maps or any other form of semi-structured data .
i could navigate my social network as easily as i navigate the collection of photos of the piazza san marco in venice that is provided as one of the demonstrations , or move from web page to web page following a breaking news story .
with facebook as the open social network platform , google offering search , e-mail and applications , and photosynth stitching it all together into one graphical 3d space that we navigate with a mouse or a nintendo wii-like controller , we are moving closer to the model of cyberspace described by william gibson in his 1984 novel neuromancer .
gibson imagined an online world in which large corporations defined rigid hierarchical structures of data like the " stepped scarlet pyramid of the eastern seaboard fission authority " .
by contrast , we could have billions of flickr photos and facebook profiles stitched together into an ever-changing quilt , but the end result would be the " graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system " that he described .
we may be watching on screens instead of having a direct neural input allowing us to " jack in " to the matrix , but it will still be a lot more fun than today 's flat web .

in 1968 , the first year after abortion was legalised , just over 22,000 terminations were carried out - in 2006 the figure in england and wales exceeded 193,000 a year .
the 1967 abortion act spells out the categories under which a termination can be permitted .
the figures on these categories tell us only a fraction of the human stories that lie behind the decision to have an abortion .
just 1 % are on the grounds that the child born would be seriously disabled and only 2 % are because the pregnancy would affect existing children in a family .
it is not satisfactory that the rate of abortion is partly caused by people using it as a form of contraception lord steel the vast majority - 96 % - are because of injury to a woman 's health - a broad category which covers almost every cause of an unwanted pregnancy .
these figures have prompted a debate about whether abortion is being used as contraception .
the man who proposed legalising abortion 40 years ago accepts that is sometimes the case .
lord steel said : " it is not satisfactory that the rate of abortion is partly caused by people using it as a form of contraception .
" but it is important to note that the level of abortion in this country is still significantly lower than it is in some other countries like australia and the us . "
some of lord steel 's concern is shared by the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists - it argues that there needs to be rethink of the way sex education is provided , with the aim of changing attitudes and behaviour .
the taboo , even 40 years on , is really strong dr kate worsley marie stopes international while unwanted teenage pregnancies remain a concern in the uk , almost half of all abortions are carried out on women in their 20s and the overwhelming majority of terminations are before 13 weeks gestation .
the 1967 abortion act does not apply to northern ireland , where abortion is only legal under some limited conditions .
overall , 32 % of women having an abortion will already have had at least one termination and nearly half will already be mothers .
forty years on and surprisingly little is known for certain about the many reasons which lead women to seek an abortion .
dr kate worsley , of marie stopes international , said in her experience most women were very clear about their decision .
she says the rising number of abortions is a failure of contraception - with it either letting women down or being used inappropriately .
social taboo although she supports women 's right to chose , dr worsley accepts there is still a strong social taboo that prevents many women from disclosing abortions to their close friends , family and partners .
young people are much more aware of what abortion is , and how traumatic , and how drastic it is anne atkins " the taboo , even 40 years on , is really strong .
it is such a personal and sensitive issue and i think women fear judgement still and fear that they wo n't be able to justify their decisions . "
the debate about abortion has never really gone away but it fluctuates in intensity .
medical understanding of the development of foetuses has moved on and the prospects for babies born very prematurely have altered beyond recognition .
anne atkins , a christian commentator , argues growing knowledge has , if anything , led to a more ambivalent attitude .
" you no longer hear the sort of vocabulary that we heard 20 years that a foetus is just a blob of jelly , or part of a woman 's body .
you do n't hear that kind of flippant talk anymore .
" young people are much more aware of what abortion is and how traumatic and how drastic it is .
that is not to say they wo n't take that option . "
doctors want reform but some doctors now believe an abortion law 40 years old is more than due for an overhaul .
next week the bma will hear a call at its annual conference for abortion to be made easier for women in the early stages of pregnancy .
a motion calling for the need for two doctors to approve a termination to be reduced to one has gained the backing of the bma ethics committee .
they also want a relaxation of the rules governing where it can be carried out , to allow pills to be dispensed in gp surgeries .
even if the bma were to support the move it could only happen with a change in the law - and that would inevitably prove controversial .

in 1968 , the first year after abortion was legalised , just over 22,000 terminations were carried out - in 2006 the figure in england and wales exceeded 193,000 a year .
the 1967 abortion act spells out the categories under which a termination can be permitted .
the figures on these categories tell us only a fraction of the human stories that lie behind the decision to have an abortion .
just 1 % are on the grounds that the child born would be seriously disabled and only 2 % are because the pregnancy would affect existing children in a family . "
it is not satisfactory that the rate of abortion is partly caused by people using it as a form of contraception " lord steel the vast majority - 96 % - are because of injury to a woman 's health - a broad category which covers almost every cause of an unwanted pregnancy .
these figures have prompted a debate about whether abortion is being used as contraception .
the man who proposed legalising abortion 40 years ago accepts that is sometimes the case .
lord steel said : " it is not satisfactory that the rate of abortion is partly caused by people using it as a form of contraception .
" but it is important to note that the level of abortion in this country is still significantly lower than it is in some other countries like australia and the us . "
some of lord steel 's concern is shared by the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists - it argues that there needs to be rethink of the way sex education is provided , with the aim of changing attitudes and behaviour . "
the taboo , even 40 years on , is really strong " dr kate worsley marie stopes international while unwanted teenage pregnancies remain a concern in the uk , almost half of all abortions are carried out on women in their 20s and the overwhelming majority of terminations are before 13 weeks gestation .
the 1967 abortion act does not apply to northern ireland , where abortion is only legal under some limited conditions .
overall , 32 % of women having an abortion will already have had at least one termination and nearly half will already be mothers .
forty years on and surprisingly little is known for certain about the many reasons which lead women to seek an abortion .
dr kate worsley , of marie stopes international , said in her experience most women were very clear about their decision .
she says the rising number of abortions is a failure of contraception - with it either letting women down or being used inappropriately .
social taboo although she supports women 's right to chose , dr worsley accepts there is still a strong social taboo that prevents many women from disclosing abortions to their close friends , family and partners . "
young people are much more aware of what abortion is , and how traumatic , and how drastic it is " anne atkins " the taboo , even 40 years on , is really strong .
it is such a personal and sensitive issue and i think women fear judgement still and fear that they wo n't be able to justify their decisions . "
the debate about abortion has never really gone away but it fluctuates in intensity .
medical understanding of the development of foetuses has moved on and the prospects for babies born very prematurely have altered beyond recognition .
anne atkins , a christian commentator , argues growing knowledge has , if anything , led to a more ambivalent attitude .
" you no longer hear the sort of vocabulary that we heard 20 years that a foetus is just a blob of jelly , or part of a woman 's body .
you do n't hear that kind of flippant talk anymore .
" young people are much more aware of what abortion is and how traumatic and how drastic it is .
that is not to say they wo n't take that option . "
doctors want reform but some doctors now believe an abortion law 40 years old is more than due for an overhaul .
next week the bma will hear a call at its annual conference for abortion to be made easier for women in the early stages of pregnancy .
a motion calling for the need for two doctors to approve a termination to be reduced to one has gained the backing of the bma ethics committee .
they also want a relaxation of the rules governing where it can be carried out , to allow pills to be dispensed in gp surgeries .
even if the bma were to support the move it could only happen with a change in the law - and that would inevitably prove controversial .

the australian bureau of agriculture and resource economics forecasts that wheat crops will hit 26 million tonnes in 2007 , up from 10 million in 2006 .
the higher output could add 1 % to economic growth after a period of extreme weather that blighted crops .

" in the near term , a revival in the farm sector is not a problem , " said adam carr , a senior economist at ubs .
" it means under-utilised land is more productive , which should help temper rising food prices . "
but problems could occur in 2008 " when the boost to farm incomes feeds through to the broader economy , " he added .

the australian bureau of agriculture and resource economics forecasts that wheat crops will hit 26 million tonnes in 2007 , up from 10 million in 2006 .
the higher output could add 1 % to economic growth after a period of extreme weather that blighted crops .
the rise is good news for farmers , but analysts say it could fuel inflation .
" the combination of improved seasonal conditions and better prices have given farmers plenty of reasons to smile , " said craig james , chief economist with commonwealth securities .
the rain has mainly fallen in coastal areas , but some key central agricultural land remains short of water and restrictions will still apply .
broader impact in the longer term , analysts have raised fears that growth in the farm sector might have a harmful impact on the economy as a whole .
" in the near term , a revival in the farm sector is not a problem , " said adam carr , a senior economist at ubs .
" it means under-utilised land is more productive , which should help temper rising food prices . "
but problems could occur in 2008 " when the boost to farm incomes feeds through to the broader economy , " he added .
the figures come a week after a member of australia 's central bank said inflation could increase next year and the bank would look into whether interest rates should be raised .

there was also a rise in the under-16 abortion rate , to 3.9 per 1,000 women , and among under-18s to 18.2 per 1,000 .
abortion has been increasing since it was legalised 40 years ago - there were 22,000 legal terminations in 1968 .
the royal college of obstetricians said the rise was " disappointing " and showed a failure to deal with the problem of unplanned pregnancies .
the abortion rate was highest , at 35 per 1,000 , for women aged 19 .
a rise in the number of abortions is not the problem in itself - the real problem is the number of woman experiencing unintended pregnancy ann furedi british pregnancy advisory service abortion : an emotive issue three out of ten terminations were carried out using an " abortion pill " - up from 24 % of the total in 2005 .
some 89 % of abortions were carried out at under 13 weeks gestation , with 68 % carried out in the first ten weeks of a pregnancy .
two thousands abortions - 1 % of the total - were carried out on the grounds that the child would be born disabled .
early access health minister caroline flint said : " we welcome the fact that a higher percentage of abortions are taking place at an early stage - almost two-thirds under 10 weeks gestation and most under 13 weeks .
" it is important that women have early access to abortion services as the earlier the abortion , the lower the risk of complications .
" however , the nhs needs to work harder to reduce the demand for abortions by improving access to contraception . "
anne weyman , chief executive of the family planning assocation said the rise in abortions was not surprising , as contraceptive services were " in crisis " .
she said : " services are being cut and clinics are closing up and down the country .
" in england , the average amount spent on each woman 's contraception is about £ 11 .
" some primary care trusts have admitted they spend just 18 pence .
" this is unbelievable and would n't be tolerated if it happened in another part of healthcare . "
government blamed the society for the protection of unborn children -lrb- spuc -rrb- said government policy to cut waiting lists had promoted fast-track abortion , and made doctors reluctant to refer women for counselling .
paul tully , spuc general secretary , said : " without positive support an abortion can seem unavoidable - but may be bitterly regretted later on .
" the government 's approach of promoting early abortion is increasing the overall number of abortions .
" gordon brown should end the labour government 's policy of rushing women as quickly as possible through the abortion mill in its frenzy to cut waiting times . "
mr tully also called for measures to stop teenagers being allowed to have abortions without the knowledge of their parents .
attitudes changing ann furedi , chief executive of the british pregnancy advisory service , which provides contraception and abortion services , said : " increasingly , women expect to be able to plan their families , and they can not do this through contraception alone .
" contraception sometimes fails and sometimes we fail to use it properly .
" women will always need the option of abortion if their usual birth control has let them down . "
ms furedi said social attitudes to abortion were also changing , with more people understanding that becoming a parent was a significant social resonsibility that not everybody was in a position to accept .
" a rise in the number of abortions is not the problem in itself - the real problem is the number of woman experiencing unintended pregnancy .
" for some of these , abortion will be the solution to the very serious problem of being faced with an unplanned , unwanted pregnancy . "
the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists called for a review sex education to help address the issue .

there was also a rise in the under-16 abortion rate , to 3.9 per 1,000 women , and among under-18s to 18.2 per 1,000 .
abortion has been increasing since it was legalised 40 years ago - there were 22,000 legal terminations in 1968 .
the royal college of obstetricians said the rise was " disappointing " and showed a failure to deal with the problem of unplanned pregnancies .
