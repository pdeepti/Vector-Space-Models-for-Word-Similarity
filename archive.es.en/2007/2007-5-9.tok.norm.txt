when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer protection minister horst seehofer wants germans to eat healthy with a five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " the government agreed on wednesday to promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to their nutritional needs .
" this is really simply about what 's the right way to eat , " said germany 's minister for food , agriculture and consumer protection , horst seehofer .
according to government statistics , around 37 million adults and around two million children in germany are overweight .
one fourth of adult germans suffer from cardiovascular diseases , while there are around four million diabetics in the country .
one in five german women and one in seven men have chronic back pain .
the annual costs of treating nutrition-related illnesses amount to 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 95.3 billion -rrb- , which is 30 percent of germany 's overall health costs .
a plan to shape up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health minister ulla schmidt stresses the importance of nutritional education health minister ulla schmidt said that many germans know what constitutes a healthy lifestyle , but are not necessarily actively pursuing it .
" that 's why we need a plan that would involve everybody , " schmidt said .
the government 's obesity prevention strategy calls on politicians , scientists , sports clubs , health-care providers , unions and the food industry to join in the battle to get germans to shape up .
according to the plan , nutritional information should be more readily available on all kinds of food products .
kindergartens , schools , universities and hospitals should also pay more attention to the kinds of food they serve in their cafeterias .
the ultimate goal of the strategy is to improve public health and stop the increasing obesity rates among children by 2020 .

the new initiative was spurred by a study released by the international association for the study of obesity .
it found that among eu countries , germany has the most overweight women and men .
among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight ; 75.4 percent of men tip the scales .
running a close second among women was the uk , where 58.5 percent of women are overweight .
among men , the czech republic came in second .
the thinnest europeans of both sexes live in italy and france .

years of effort have failed to produce any meaningful social protection in these countries , the g8 ministers acknowledged in a statement at the end of the conference .
recommendations from the meeting were being prepared for the summit hosted by germany next month in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social responsability should be partly compulsory , müntefering said " strengthening and broadening of social protection -lrb- is -rrb- one of the most important tasks in the context of globalization processes , " the statement said , pointing out the value of such standards in combating poverty and promoting economic and social development .
little leverage german labor minister franz müntefering said the g8 as a group was unable to present concrete demands because setting minimum standards for social protection falls under the jurisdiction of individual states .
müntefering said the only possibility was to make agreements " and then canvas support for them to be adhered to ...
you have to appeal to reason . "
to best adapt to the changes in the era of globalization , " it is crucial to enhance flexibility and adequate labor market security for individuals , " the statement said .
" in a globally competitive world , individual countries need to be innovative .
but every successful package requires well-designed employment regulations and contractual arrangements as well as adequate employment-oriented social protection , " the statement said .
representatives from the european commission , the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and the world bank also took part in the conference .
call for social responsibility the conference said that industry could make a contribution to shaping the social dimension of the world economy by taking on a greater social responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden talks were ahead of an upcoming summit in heiligendamm " companies should recognize their responsibility to their workers through the promotion of the rule of law , transparency , good governance , the ending of corruption and implementing sound industrial relations , " the ministers said .
müntefering acknowledged that corporate social responsibility will remain voluntary , but that the issue needs to be addressed by a mixture of " compulsory and non-compulsory " actions .
adequate work protections should be compulsory , he said .
' people should n't live in fear ' " social protection means people should n't live in fear and misery .
aside from needing food and drink , they need social protection for the difficult periods in life , " he said .
brazilian social welfare minister luís marinho addressed the group on tuesday , and made a few jabs at the g8 countries .
he said developing countries were doing all they could to improve conditions , but the g8 needed to do its part , as well .
the ministers officially asked the international labor organization to explain why minimum work standards that were agreed to years ago " have not been meaningfully put into place up to now . "
ilo director-general juan somavia acknowledged that it was difficult to put any meaningful pressure on world governments .
there is no body that can issue motivating sanctions that would apply to member countries , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 labor ministers call for more social engagement by business g8 labor ministers are debating whether to require big businesses to promote social and environmental programs , with the aim of a fairer globalization .

earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .

years of effort have failed to produce any meaningful social protection in these countries , the g8 ministers acknowledged in a statement at the end of the conference .
recommendations from the meeting were being prepared for the summit hosted by germany next month in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social responsability should be partly compulsory , müntefering said " strengthening and broadening of social protection -lrb- is -rrb- one of the most important tasks in the context of globalization processes , " the statement said , pointing out the value of such standards in combating poverty and promoting economic and social development .
little leverage german labor minister franz müntefering said the g8 as a group was unable to present concrete demands because setting minimum standards for social protection falls under the jurisdiction of individual states .
müntefering said the only possibility was to make agreements " and then canvas support for them to be adhered to ...
you have to appeal to reason . "
to best adapt to the changes in the era of globalization , " it is crucial to enhance flexibility and adequate labor market security for individuals , " the statement said .
" in a globally competitive world , individual countries need to be innovative .
but every successful package requires well-designed employment regulations and contractual arrangements as well as adequate employment-oriented social protection , " the statement said .
representatives from the european commission , the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and the world bank also took part in the conference .
call for social responsibility the conference said that industry could make a contribution to shaping the social dimension of the world economy by taking on a greater social responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden talks were ahead of an upcoming summit in heiligendamm " companies should recognize their responsibility to their workers through the promotion of the rule of law , transparency , good governance , the ending of corruption and implementing sound industrial relations , " the ministers said .
müntefering acknowledged that corporate social responsibility will remain voluntary , but that the issue needs to be addressed by a mixture of " compulsory and non-compulsory " actions .
adequate work protections should be compulsory , he said .
' people should n't live in fear ' " social protection means people should n't live in fear and misery .
aside from needing food and drink , they need social protection for the difficult periods in life , " he said .
brazilian social welfare minister luís marinho addressed the group on tuesday , and made a few jabs at the g8 countries .
he said developing countries were doing all they could to improve conditions , but the g8 needed to do its part , as well .
the ministers officially asked the international labor organization to explain why minimum work standards that were agreed to years ago " have not been meaningfully put into place up to now . "
ilo director-general juan somavia acknowledged that it was difficult to put any meaningful pressure on world governments .
there is no body that can issue motivating sanctions that would apply to member countries , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 labor ministers call for more social engagement by business g8 labor ministers are debating whether to require big businesses to promote social and environmental programs , with the aim of a fairer globalization .

years of effort have failed to produce any meaningful social protection in these countries , the g8 ministers acknowledged in a statement at the end of the conference .
recommendations from the meeting were being prepared for the summit hosted by germany next month in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social responsability should be partly compulsory , müntefering said " strengthening and broadening of social protection -lrb- is -rrb- one of the most important tasks in the context of globalization processes , " the statement said , pointing out the value of such standards in combating poverty and promoting economic and social development .
little leverage german labor minister franz müntefering said the g8 as a group was unable to present concrete demands because setting minimum standards for social protection falls under the jurisdiction of individual states .
müntefering said the only possibility was to make agreements " and then canvas support for them to be adhered to ...
you have to appeal to reason . "
to best adapt to the changes in the era of globalization , " it is crucial to enhance flexibility and adequate labor market security for individuals , " the statement said .
" in a globally competitive world , individual countries need to be innovative .
but every successful package requires well-designed employment regulations and contractual arrangements as well as adequate employment-oriented social protection , " the statement said .
representatives from the european commission , the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and the world bank also took part in the conference .
call for social responsibility the conference said that industry could make a contribution to shaping the social dimension of the world economy by taking on a greater social responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden talks were ahead of an upcoming summit in heiligendamm " companies should recognize their responsibility to their workers through the promotion of the rule of law , transparency , good governance , the ending of corruption and implementing sound industrial relations , " the ministers said .
müntefering acknowledged that corporate social responsibility will remain voluntary , but that the issue needs to be addressed by a mixture of " compulsory and non-compulsory " actions .
adequate work protections should be compulsory , he said .
' people should n't live in fear ' " social protection means people should n't live in fear and misery .
aside from needing food and drink , they need social protection for the difficult periods in life , " he said .
brazilian social welfare minister luís marinho addressed the group on tuesday , and made a few jabs at the g8 countries .
he said developing countries were doing all they could to improve conditions , but the g8 needed to do its part , as well .
the ministers officially asked the international labor organization to explain why minimum work standards that were agreed to years ago " have not been meaningfully put into place up to now . "
ilo director-general juan somavia acknowledged that it was difficult to put any meaningful pressure on world governments .
there is no body that can issue motivating sanctions that would apply to member countries , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 labor ministers call for more social engagement by business g8 labor ministers are debating whether to require big businesses to promote social and environmental programs , with the aim of a fairer globalization .

earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .

the eu opened in march the chapter on " enterprise and industry policy " .

the failure prompted foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist who was the sole candidate , to withdraw his name .
the prospect of gul as president had triggered mass secular protests and a tense stand-off between the islamist-rooted government and the army , which threatened to intervene to protect secularism .
rehn said that a decision on whether turkey should be allowed to join the eu should only be made " closer to completion of the negotiation process , because only then can we see if turkey is able to meet all the legal , democratic and economic criteria . "

however rehn , speaking after talks with turkey 's top eu negotiator ali babacan , said that the european union hoped to open talks with ankara , before the end of june , on three of the 35 policy chapters which must be successfully negotiated prior to membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn " i confirmed ... the goal to open three chapters still under the german -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency , " he told reporters .
portugal will assume the presidency from germany on july 1 .
this marks a major step for turkey 's eu bid as so far it has only opened two chapters , and successfully closed just one .
resumption of talks rehn stressed that the decision in march to resume the membership talks , parts of which were frozen because of turkey 's trade dispute with cyprus , was taken unanimously .
" if one or several members states want to change that negotiating mandate , then it is up to them to take the initiative and also take the responsibility of possible consequences , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy has come out strongly against turkish eu membership he congratulated sarkozy on his election win and added that it was not his task to speculate on whether the election result " is good or bad . "
" i trust that france will stick to its commitments undertaken in the course of the eu accession process , " he added .
the eu opened in march the chapter on " enterprise and industry policy " .
however no more chapters can be closed until turkey drops its long-running trade restrictions against eu member cyprus .
" in my view the best was for the eu to work with turkey in this sensitive and difficult time is by sticking to our commitment , by being firm and fair , " said rehn .
watching the political events european officials are closely watching political events in turkey , amid a crisis over the retention of a secular administration in the largely muslim nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are wary of letting turkey into the bloc turkish lawmakers on monday approved sweeping constitutional reforms that would see the president elected by popular vote , as they sought to resolve the crisis .
on sunday , parliament failed for a second time to elect a president , with an opposition boycott preventing it reaching the required quorum for a vote .
the failure prompted foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist who was the sole candidate , to withdraw his name .
the prospect of gul as president had triggered mass secular protests and a tense stand-off between the islamist-rooted government and the army , which threatened to intervene to protect secularism .
rehn said that a decision on whether turkey should be allowed to join the eu should only be made " closer to completion of the negotiation process , because only then can we see if turkey is able to meet all the legal , democratic and economic criteria . "

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

in his book " die globalisierung und ihre gegner " -lrb- globalization and its critics -rrb- , he separated the groups into five subsets : leftists and radical leftists are interested in social justice and want to develop a different societal system ; the academic left has taken up some ideas from the ecological movement and engages in a certain amount of marxist criticism ; reformers from the business world favor employing a social democratic approach to tame capitalism ; globalization critics grounded in religion link to the churches ' traditions of social reform ; and right-wing opponents to globalization put the stress on the nation state heterogeneity has advantages in addition to large organizations , such as attac , greenpeace , trade unions and churches , innumerable smaller local and regional groups are also part of the struggle , but the varying currents united by one movement is n't problematic , according to leggewie . " a movement is characterized precisely by a high level of heterogeneity and loose connections , " he said , adding that it allows the movement to distribute various tasks .
the groups aiming for reform had their target audiences just as the radical and militant groups that organize protests did . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent protesters are a minority among the critics of globalization churches made opponents of globalization capable of action by providing financing , infrastructure and organizational skills needed by a movement low on resources before trade unions or political parties get involved , leggewie said . despite their different perspectives , the groups must see their work as being interrelated , according to mies .
no progress could be made if economic factors are viewed as being unconnected to the environment issues , she said . leggewie , however , said the movement could already chalk up a huge success .
" worldwide , there 's no one anymore who pursues globalization as it was in the 1990s , " he said .
" all of the criticism that is warranted is mainstream today - such as criticism of the ecological consequences of unfettered globalization .

"

" this is really simply about what 's the right way to eat , " said germany 's minister for food , agriculture and consumer protection , horst seehofer .
according to government statistics , around 37 million adults and around two million children in germany are overweight .
one fourth of adult germans suffer from cardiovascular diseases , while there are around four million diabetics in the country .
one in five german women and one in seven men have chronic back pain .
the annual costs of treating nutrition-related illnesses amount to 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 95.3 billion -rrb- , which is 30 percent of germany 's overall health costs .

" that 's why we need a plan that would involve everybody , " schmidt said .
the government 's obesity prevention strategy calls on politicians , scientists , sports clubs , health-care providers , unions and the food industry to join in the battle to get germans to shape up .
according to the plan , nutritional information should be more readily available on all kinds of food products .
kindergartens , schools , universities and hospitals should also pay more attention to the kinds of food they serve in their cafeterias .
the ultimate goal of the strategy is to improve public health and stop the increasing obesity rates among children by 2020 .

he founded the association of democratic muslims and advocated dialogue among muslims themselves .
he also appealed to the danish people to differentiate between radical muslims and those with democratic ideals . for some observers , the time seems ripe for a shift toward the left .
according to german denmark expert bernd henningsen , ny alliance has the potential to " bring the country to its senses .

what differentiates the newbies , however , is not their stance but their strategy : while det radikale venstre boycotts the government , new alliance wants to join it . members of the new party have offered to partner up in a liberal-conservative coalition under prime minster anders fogh rasmussen of the liberal party after the 2009 national elections .
this would mean sending home the right-wing dansk folkeparti , which the ruling liberal-conservative coalition is dependent on for support . margrethe vestager , vice chairwoman of det radikale venstre , said she regrets khader 's decision to break away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ny alliance wants to build a coalition with current pm rasmussen " we are not interested in a coalition under anders fogh rasmussen , " said vestager .
" his cooperation with the dansk folkeparti and his position on tax policy are not acceptable to us . " support from conservatives in part due to its aim of forming a government coalition , ny alliance can count on support from the conservative camp .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

" the chancellor this afternoon called prime minister kostunica and informed him personally of her concern , " ulrich wilhelm said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel hopes that serbia will manage to form a democratic government " she furthermore urged him to use the narrow timeframe still available for forming a democratic government in order to keep serbia 's european prospects alive , " he added .
wilhelm was referring to a looming deadline for serbia 's political parties to form a government following legislative elections in january or face a new vote .
under the balkan state 's constitution , they have until may 14 .
serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic has set a friday deadline for parties that voted in an ultra-nationalist as parliament speaker to show if they have a majority for forming a coalition government .
a powerful post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's ultranationalist radical party leader tomislav nikolic tomislav nikolic , the leader of the serbian radical party which won most votes in the jan .
21 elections , was voted in as parliamentary speaker on tuesday with the support of kostunica 's moderate nationalists .
it is one of the three most powerful posts in the country and observers say nikolic 's election deepens the political paralysis that has beset serbia .
squabbling moderate parties have so far failed to form a coalition , despite fears that new elections could see the extreme nationalists increase their share of the vote .
the radical party was an on-off ally of late authoritarian serbian leader slobodan milosevic 's socialists throughout the balkan wars up until his arrest in 2001 and removal to the un international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
a sensitive moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav kostunica 's moderately nationalist party helped elect nikolic nikolic 's election was also criticized by the council of europe just as belgrade was due to assume on friday the rotating chairmanship of the council 's committee of ministers which groups the 46 member states ' foreign ministers and representatives .
rene van der linden , president of the council 's parliamentary assembly , said that the election of nikolic was " a burden on serbia 's ability to carry out its task " as chairman of the committee .
" the parliamentary assembly 's values are totally opposed to those of mr. nikolic 's party .
given the gravity of this issue , the parliamentary assembly will continue to follow developments closely , " he said .
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president boris tadic set friday as a deadline for the formation of a new government the european union froze rapprochement talks with belgrade a year ago , mainly because of belgrade 's failure to hand former bosnian serb army chief ratko mladic over to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia .
nikolic 's election , however , comes as serbia battles the prospect of its province of kosovo being awarded independence by the un security council , an issue the radicals have campaigned hard against .
it was an argument over key security posts that handle the kosovo issue and relations with the un tribunal that led to the break up of coalition talks between the parties of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , kostunica and the reformist g17 plus . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united nations envoy says kosovo must stick to his plan the un special envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said he saw no alternative to his proposal for supervised independence for serbian breakaway province kosovo .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teenagers could not imagine a life without cell phones there is probably no easier way to upset a group of sleep-deprived adults on their way to work than to subject them to the ambient sounds of burping crocodiles or robotic squeaks of mexican folk bands singing " la cucaracha " after sniffing helium .
and it 's not as if one can escape the manic world of cell phones .
they are literally everywhere - in restaurants , parks , public transportation and movie theaters .
surely , mobile phones are a means of communication and a symbol of the information overload that characterizes our society .
but they are also much more than that : a tool of self-fashioning and personal expression , according to the fashion mantra of the 21st century : let me hear your cell phone ring and i will tell you what kind of person you are .
it 's not all that bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if beethoven could only hear that even birds know his ode to joy !
cell phones can , however , be used for goals more inspiring than driving your fellow subway-passengers up the wall .
william engelen , for instance , a dutch artist living in germany , may revolutionize the way we think about cell phones .
engelen asked the residents of bonn to download a digital version of the " ode to joy " from beethoven 's " 9th symphony " and use it as their mobile ring tone .
his idea is that if enough cell phone users play the same musical melody every time their mobile rings , male blackbirds will begin to imitate the sound .
that blackbirds have an artistic streak in them has been well-documented by biologists observing their behavior .
male blackbirds are big fans of singing competitions .
in the mother nature 's very own , original version of " avian idol " - later appropriated by humans and turned into an international money-making machine known as " american idol " or " german superstar " - they get to exercise their vocal chords and fight for the prestigious title of the loudest bird on the block .
chicks apparently love it .
that 's why some urban blackbirds can begin to sound like sirens , honking cars or even popular song refrains .
sing it back !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's , like , all of a sudden , everybody has the same ring tone with bonn being the city of birth of ludwig van beethoven , engelen chose to teach birds to chirp the great composer .
the entire project is sponsored by the beethoven foundation and has received quite a bit of publicity locally as a curious artistic intervention in the animal world .
engelen says if it works , he 'll take the project to other cities .
if all goes as planned , the bonn blackbirds will be able to form a chorus of their own and tour the rest of the country .
this is likely to raise the profile of classical music among birds in general and may even push beethoven to the top of avian pop charts .

" the chancellor this afternoon called prime minister kostunica and informed him personally of her concern , " ulrich wilhelm said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel hopes that serbia will manage to form a democratic government " she furthermore urged him to use the narrow timeframe still available for forming a democratic government in order to keep serbia 's european prospects alive , " he added .

it is one of the three most powerful posts in the country and observers say nikolic 's election deepens the political paralysis that has beset serbia .
squabbling moderate parties have so far failed to form a coalition , despite fears that new elections could see the extreme nationalists increase their share of the vote .
the radical party was an on-off ally of late authoritarian serbian leader slobodan milosevic 's socialists throughout the balkan wars up until his arrest in 2001 and removal to the un international war crimes tribunal in the hague .

rene van der linden , president of the council 's parliamentary assembly , said that the election of nikolic was " a burden on serbia 's ability to carry out its task " as chairman of the committee .
" the parliamentary assembly 's values are totally opposed to those of mr. nikolic 's party .
given the gravity of this issue , the parliamentary assembly will continue to follow developments closely , " he said .

nikolic 's election , however , comes as serbia battles the prospect of its province of kosovo being awarded independence by the un security council , an issue the radicals have campaigned hard against .
it was an argument over key security posts that handle the kosovo issue and relations with the un tribunal that led to the break up of coalition talks between the parties of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , kostunica and the reformist g17 plus . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united nations envoy says kosovo must stick to his plan the un special envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said he saw no alternative to his proposal for supervised independence for serbian breakaway province kosovo .

the software will identify the paper color , typefaces , any rubber stamps and the outlines of the tears .
just like a jigsaw solver , as soon as it discovers edges that match , it will link up the images .
" it 's very exciting to decode stasi papers , " schneider said .
" you have the feeling you are making history . "
the job was made easier by the way the stasi officers had manually torn up the papers after their office shredders had broken down .
when a table would get filled with torn pieces , they were all shoved into one bag before the next lot was torn .
as a result , each sack contains almost a complete set of papers , with practically no mixing of documents between the bags .
before the collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany was a police state as communism collapsed in 1989 , the ministry for state security burned and shredded files and tore others up by hand .
the burning and shredding can not be undone , but the new authorities retrieved the scraps that were semi-intact and only jumbled .
berlin vowed to put the scraps , which are mostly postcard sized , back into the correct order to be read .
the job fell to 15 workers sitting in an office near nürnberg who have managed to work through 323 sacks since 1995 .
with nearly 16,000 more sacks to go , it would take over 400 years to complete the job manually .
in 2003 , the government said it could not afford 50 million euros to computerize the task , so legislators have approved a more modest pilot project .
each scrap will be scanned and a computer will try to match images by shape , jigsaw style , to others from the same sack .
germany has already opened many undamaged stasi files to historians and to former stasi victims , helping them to identify informers in a society that was ruled by the fear of denunciation , but there are big gaps in the archives .
staff working for the custodian of the files , former east german democracy activist marianne birthler , say the funding means 400 more sacks can be processed in the next two years , more than the number reconstituted so far by human intelligence .
new insights expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi archives were already used to expose former spies birthler aide günter bormann said the bags to be scanned and re- assembled appeared to contain files in active use in 1988 and 1989 as the communist system teetered on the brink of collapse .
none are thought to relate to east german espionage abroad : that department 's files were almost completely destroyed .
it is not clear yet what will happen after the pilot project is completed .
undamaged stasi files have already helped to expose many of the turncoats who tried to bury their past when communism fell .
former stasi officers are barred as security risks from many german public offices .
a legislator , klaus-peter willsch , said the documents might help undercover more stasi informers so they can be punished .
he believes all 16,000 sacks could be reconstructed for less than 30 million euros -lrb- 40 million dollars -rrb- . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new exhibition looks at daily life in east germany a new exhibition on east germany has just opened in berlin 's german historical museum .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teenagers could not imagine a life without cell phones there is probably no easier way to upset a group of sleep-deprived adults on their way to work than to subject them to the ambient sounds of burping crocodiles or robotic squeaks of mexican folk bands singing " la cucaracha " after sniffing helium .
and it 's not as if one can escape the manic world of cell phones .
they are literally everywhere - in restaurants , parks , public transportation and movie theaters .
surely , mobile phones are a means of communication and a symbol of the information overload that characterizes our society .
but they are also much more than that : a tool of self-fashioning and personal expression , according to the fashion mantra of the 21st century : let me hear your cell phone ring and i will tell you what kind of person you are .
it 's not all that bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if beethoven could only hear that even birds know his ode to joy !
cell phones can , however , be used for goals more inspiring than driving your fellow subway-passengers up the wall .
william engelen , for instance , a dutch artist living in germany , may revolutionize the way we think about cell phones .
engelen asked the residents of bonn to download a digital version of the " ode to joy " from beethoven 's " 9th symphony " and use it as their mobile ring tone .
his idea is that if enough cell phone users play the same musical melody every time their mobile rings , male blackbirds will begin to imitate the sound .
that blackbirds have an artistic streak in them has been well-documented by biologists observing their behavior .
male blackbirds are big fans of singing competitions .
in the mother nature 's very own , original version of " avian idol " - later appropriated by humans and turned into an international money-making machine known as " american idol " or " german superstar " - they get to exercise their vocal chords and fight for the prestigious title of the loudest bird on the block .
chicks apparently love it .
that 's why some urban blackbirds can begin to sound like sirens , honking cars or even popular song refrains .
sing it back !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's , like , all of a sudden , everybody has the same ring tone with bonn being the city of birth of ludwig van beethoven , engelen chose to teach birds to chirp the great composer .
the entire project is sponsored by the beethoven foundation and has received quite a bit of publicity locally as a curious artistic intervention in the animal world .
engelen says if it works , he 'll take the project to other cities .
if all goes as planned , the bonn blackbirds will be able to form a chorus of their own and tour the rest of the country .
this is likely to raise the profile of classical music among birds in general and may even push beethoven to the top of avian pop charts .

visitors to mittenwald will find a statue on the town 's market square commemorating the renowned instrument builder .
hanging on to tradition in the 19th century , competition between violin makers became increasingly tough due to the use of new mass production methods .
to preserve the tradition and art of entirely handmade instruments , bavarian elector maximilian i commissioned a school for young violin makers in 1858 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.05.2007 german finance minister under pressure to align budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's budget is becoming less of a black hole politicians are calling for finance minister peer steinbrück to balance germany 's budget by 2009 .
earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .
the news magazine focus reported that steinbrück was facing increased demands from the big spending ministries , amounting to seven billion euros in 2008 and a total of 28 billion by 2011 .

" we suspect those targeted , who belong to the militant extreme-left scene , of founding a terrorist organisation or being members of such an organisation , that is planning arson attacks and other actions to severely disrupt or prevent the early-summer g8 summit in heiligendamm from taking place , " the prosecutor 's office said .
the summit which opens on june 6 on germany 's baltic coast will see german chancellor angeal merkel hosting the leaders of britain , canada , france , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
climate change and poverty in africa will dominate the agenda .
german politicians and security experts have issued warnings of potential violence ahead of the summit .
" we are particularly focused on dangers arising from violent globalization opponents , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
police targeted members of militant groups police suspect the left-wing militants they are targeting of being behind a string of attacks in and around hamburg and berlin .
last december , a car was set on fire in front of the home of deputy finance minister thomas mirow and the walls of his home were splattered with paint .
the hotel where the summit is to take place has also been vandalized with paint .
on wednesday , the more than 40 raids across the country included one on the leftist " rote flora " cultural center in hamburg amid concerns it was being used by a domestic left-wing radical group .
the investigation also focused on members of the radical communist organization " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- , which has claimed 25 attacks since 2001 .
most have involved setting fire to a building or vehicle belonging to the police or other public institution .

" we 're not dealing here with some left-wing loonies who want to throw a bucket of paint , " the online version of news magazine der spiegel quoted an investigator involved in the raids as saying .
" we 're talking here about groups who have terrorism potential . "
protest from the far-left anti-globalization groups like gipfelsoli and attac have condemned the raids as " a wave of repression " and " criminalization . "
" all attempts to criminalize us do not change the fact that we will sue the g8 -lrb- summit -rrb- to cast a spotlight on the injustices of this world , " said hanne jobst from gipfelsoli in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arson and vandalism are the main crimes from militant left-wing groups germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , however , has said that he sees a clear security threat .
he has announced has announced a tightening of border controls ahead of the summit .
that will mean that the country 's visa-free travel policy for schengen zone members would be suspended during the event , as it was during the soccer world cup last summer .
police are bracing for an expected 100,000 demonstrators to gather in the area near the summit venue , a luxury hotel in heiligendamm on the baltic coast , on june 6-8 .
tight security measures are in the works , including a 12 kilometer -lrb- 7.5 mile -rrb- long fence designed to protect diplomats attending the event .
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed in riots . demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 aims to link aid , social standards in developing world labor and employment ministers from the world 's richest nations appealed to developing countries and emerging economies to improve social standards .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teenagers could not imagine a life without cell phones there is probably no easier way to upset a group of sleep-deprived adults on their way to work than to subject them to the ambient sounds of burping crocodiles or robotic squeaks of mexican folk bands singing " la cucaracha " after sniffing helium .
and it 's not as if one can escape the manic world of cell phones .
they are literally everywhere - in restaurants , parks , public transportation and movie theaters .
surely , mobile phones are a means of communication and a symbol of the information overload that characterizes our society .
but they are also much more than that : a tool of self-fashioning and personal expression , according to the fashion mantra of the 21st century : let me hear your cell phone ring and i will tell you what kind of person you are .
it 's not all that bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if beethoven could only hear that even birds know his ode to joy !
cell phones can , however , be used for goals more inspiring than driving your fellow subway-passengers up the wall .
william engelen , for instance , a dutch artist living in germany , may revolutionize the way we think about cell phones .
engelen asked the residents of bonn to download a digital version of the " ode to joy " from beethoven 's " 9th symphony " and use it as their mobile ring tone .
his idea is that if enough cell phone users play the same musical melody every time their mobile rings , male blackbirds will begin to imitate the sound .
that blackbirds have an artistic streak in them has been well-documented by biologists observing their behavior .
male blackbirds are big fans of singing competitions .
in the mother nature 's very own , original version of " avian idol " - later appropriated by humans and turned into an international money-making machine known as " american idol " or " german superstar " - they get to exercise their vocal chords and fight for the prestigious title of the loudest bird on the block .
chicks apparently love it .
that 's why some urban blackbirds can begin to sound like sirens , honking cars or even popular song refrains .
sing it back !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's , like , all of a sudden , everybody has the same ring tone with bonn being the city of birth of ludwig van beethoven , engelen chose to teach birds to chirp the great composer .
the entire project is sponsored by the beethoven foundation and has received quite a bit of publicity locally as a curious artistic intervention in the animal world .
engelen says if it works , he 'll take the project to other cities .
if all goes as planned , the bonn blackbirds will be able to form a chorus of their own and tour the rest of the country .
this is likely to raise the profile of classical music among birds in general and may even push beethoven to the top of avian pop charts .

" this is really simply about what 's the right way to eat , " said germany 's minister for food , agriculture and consumer protection , horst seehofer .
according to government statistics , around 37 million adults and around two million children in germany are overweight .
one fourth of adult germans suffer from cardiovascular diseases , while there are around four million diabetics in the country .

" that 's why we need a plan that would involve everybody , " schmidt said .
the government 's obesity prevention strategy calls on politicians , scientists , sports clubs , health-care providers , unions and the food industry to join in the battle to get germans to shape up .
according to the plan , nutritional information should be more readily available on all kinds of food products .
kindergartens , schools , universities and hospitals should also pay more attention to the kinds of food they serve in their cafeterias .
the ultimate goal of the strategy is to improve public health and stop the increasing obesity rates among children by 2020 .

earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .
the news magazine focus reported that steinbrück was facing increased demands from the big spending ministries , amounting to seven billion euros in 2008 and a total of 28 billion by 2011 .

earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .
the news magazine focus reported that steinbrück was facing increased demands from the big spending ministries , amounting to seven billion euros in 2008 and a total of 28 billion by 2011 .

the failure prompted foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist who was the sole candidate , to withdraw his name .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.05.2007 german finance minister under pressure to align budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's budget is becoming less of a black hole politicians are calling for finance minister peer steinbrück to balance germany 's budget by 2009 .
earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .
the news magazine focus reported that steinbrück was facing increased demands from the big spending ministries , amounting to seven billion euros in 2008 and a total of 28 billion by 2011 .
focus cited a list from the finance ministry it had seen . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says german deficit sinking fast the european commission said germany 's efforts to clean up its financial house are paying off , with the country expected to pare its budget deficit down to three percent of gross domestic product in 2008 .

however no more chapters can be closed until turkey drops its long-running trade restrictions against eu member cyprus .
" in my view the best was for the eu to work with turkey in this sensitive and difficult time is by sticking to our commitment , by being firm and fair , " said rehn .
watching the political events european officials are closely watching political events in turkey , amid a crisis over the retention of a secular administration in the largely muslim nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are wary of letting turkey into the bloc turkish lawmakers on monday approved sweeping constitutional reforms that would see the president elected by popular vote , as they sought to resolve the crisis .
on sunday , parliament failed for a second time to elect a president , with an opposition boycott preventing it reaching the required quorum for a vote .
the failure prompted foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist who was the sole candidate , to withdraw his name .
the prospect of gul as president had triggered mass secular protests and a tense stand-off between the islamist-rooted government and the army , which threatened to intervene to protect secularism .
rehn said that a decision on whether turkey should be allowed to join the eu should only be made " closer to completion of the negotiation process , because only then can we see if turkey is able to meet all the legal , democratic and economic criteria . "

earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .
the news magazine focus reported that steinbrück was facing increased demands from the big spending ministries , amounting to seven billion euros in 2008 and a total of 28 billion by 2011 .
focus cited a list from the finance ministry it had seen . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says german deficit sinking fast the european commission said germany 's efforts to clean up its financial house are paying off , with the country expected to pare its budget deficit down to three percent of gross domestic product in 2008 .

an advocate of free speech and muslim dialogue , he 's now founded a new party against right-wingers . denmark 's new party , ny alliance -lrb- new alliance -rrb- , has been stirring up the country 's political landscape .
earlier this week , the party officially broke away from the social-liberal party det radikale venstre under the leadership of syrian-born parliamentarian naser khader . " we feel politically homeless and believe that there are many others who feel the same way , " said khader . khader has gained in popularity since a danish newspaper caused an international uproar by publishing caricatures of mohammed in september 2005 .
he founded the association of democratic muslims and advocated dialogue among muslims themselves .
he also appealed to the danish people to differentiate between radical muslims and those with democratic ideals . for some observers , the time seems ripe for a shift toward the left .
according to german denmark expert bernd henningsen , ny alliance has the potential to " bring the country to its senses .

one member of the country 's third strongest party called homosexuality a " sickness .

an advocate of free speech and muslim dialogue , he 's now founded a new party against right-wingers . denmark 's new party , ny alliance -lrb- new alliance -rrb- , has been stirring up the country 's political landscape .
earlier this week , the party officially broke away from the social-liberal party det radikale venstre under the leadership of syrian-born parliamentarian naser khader . " we feel politically homeless and believe that there are many others who feel the same way , " said khader . khader has gained in popularity since a danish newspaper caused an international uproar by publishing caricatures of mohammed in september 2005 .
he founded the association of democratic muslims and advocated dialogue among muslims themselves .
he also appealed to the danish people to differentiate between radical muslims and those with democratic ideals . for some observers , the time seems ripe for a shift toward the left .
according to german denmark expert bernd henningsen , ny alliance has the potential to " bring the country to its senses . " nationalist tendencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper caused an uproar in the muslim world over the past few months , members of the nationalistic dansk folkeparti -lrb- danish people 's party -rrb- have provoked the public with numerous statements against foreigners .
one member of the country 's third strongest party called homosexuality a " sickness . " another parliamentarian found resonance among fellow politicians when he compared the muslim headscarf to the nazi swastika . according to official statements , ny alliance members left the folkeparti in protest of its national rhetoric . if you ca n't beat them … det radikale venstre , which is more center-left on the political spectrum than the name suggests , is no less vocal against the far right than the khader 's group .
what differentiates the newbies , however , is not their stance but their strategy : while det radikale venstre boycotts the government , new alliance wants to join it . members of the new party have offered to partner up in a liberal-conservative coalition under prime minster anders fogh rasmussen of the liberal party after the 2009 national elections .
this would mean sending home the right-wing dansk folkeparti , which the ruling liberal-conservative coalition is dependent on for support . margrethe vestager , vice chairwoman of det radikale venstre , said she regrets khader 's decision to break away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ny alliance wants to build a coalition with current pm rasmussen " we are not interested in a coalition under anders fogh rasmussen , " said vestager .
" his cooperation with the dansk folkeparti and his position on tax policy are not acceptable to us . " support from conservatives in part due to its aim of forming a government coalition , ny alliance can count on support from the conservative camp .

last year , the council of europe criticized the scandinavian country for maintaining " an atmosphere of intolerance and xenophobia . " just a few days after its founding , ny alliance claims to have some 10,500 members already , which would put it on equal ground with its political opponents .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

" the chancellor this afternoon called prime minister kostunica and informed him personally of her concern , " ulrich wilhelm said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel hopes that serbia will manage to form a democratic government " she furthermore urged him to use the narrow timeframe still available for forming a democratic government in order to keep serbia 's european prospects alive , " he added .
wilhelm was referring to a looming deadline for serbia 's political parties to form a government following legislative elections in january or face a new vote .

it is one of the three most powerful posts in the country and observers say nikolic 's election deepens the political paralysis that has beset serbia .
squabbling moderate parties have so far failed to form a coalition , despite fears that new elections could see the extreme nationalists increase their share of the vote .

nikolic 's election , however , comes as serbia battles the prospect of its province of kosovo being awarded independence by the un security council , an issue the radicals have campaigned hard against .
it was an argument over key security posts that handle the kosovo issue and relations with the un tribunal that led to the break up of coalition talks between the parties of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , kostunica and the reformist g17 plus . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united nations envoy says kosovo must stick to his plan the un special envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said he saw no alternative to his proposal for supervised independence for serbian breakaway province kosovo .

the software will identify the paper color , typefaces , any rubber stamps and the outlines of the tears .
just like a jigsaw solver , as soon as it discovers edges that match , it will link up the images .
" it 's very exciting to decode stasi papers , " schneider said .

the job was made easier by the way the stasi officers had manually torn up the papers after their office shredders had broken down .

berlin vowed to put the scraps , which are mostly postcard sized , back into the correct order to be read .
the job fell to 15 workers sitting in an office near nürnberg who have managed to work through 323 sacks since 1995 .
with nearly 16,000 more sacks to go , it would take over 400 years to complete the job manually .

germany has already opened many undamaged stasi files to historians and to former stasi victims , helping them to identify informers in a society that was ruled by the fear of denunciation , but there are big gaps in the archives .
staff working for the custodian of the files , former east german democracy activist marianne birthler , say the funding means 400 more sacks can be processed in the next two years , more than the number reconstituted so far by human intelligence .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teenagers could not imagine a life without cell phones there is probably no easier way to upset a group of sleep-deprived adults on their way to work than to subject them to the ambient sounds of burping crocodiles or robotic squeaks of mexican folk bands singing " la cucaracha " after sniffing helium .
and it 's not as if one can escape the manic world of cell phones .
they are literally everywhere - in restaurants , parks , public transportation and movie theaters .
surely , mobile phones are a means of communication and a symbol of the information overload that characterizes our society .
but they are also much more than that : a tool of self-fashioning and personal expression , according to the fashion mantra of the 21st century : let me hear your cell phone ring and i will tell you what kind of person you are .
it 's not all that bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if beethoven could only hear that even birds know his ode to joy !
cell phones can , however , be used for goals more inspiring than driving your fellow subway-passengers up the wall .
william engelen , for instance , a dutch artist living in germany , may revolutionize the way we think about cell phones .
engelen asked the residents of bonn to download a digital version of the " ode to joy " from beethoven 's " 9th symphony " and use it as their mobile ring tone .
his idea is that if enough cell phone users play the same musical melody every time their mobile rings , male blackbirds will begin to imitate the sound .
that blackbirds have an artistic streak in them has been well-documented by biologists observing their behavior .
male blackbirds are big fans of singing competitions .
in the mother nature 's very own , original version of " avian idol " - later appropriated by humans and turned into an international money-making machine known as " american idol " or " german superstar " - they get to exercise their vocal chords and fight for the prestigious title of the loudest bird on the block .
chicks apparently love it .
that 's why some urban blackbirds can begin to sound like sirens , honking cars or even popular song refrains .
sing it back !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's , like , all of a sudden , everybody has the same ring tone with bonn being the city of birth of ludwig van beethoven , engelen chose to teach birds to chirp the great composer .
the entire project is sponsored by the beethoven foundation and has received quite a bit of publicity locally as a curious artistic intervention in the animal world .
engelen says if it works , he 'll take the project to other cities .
if all goes as planned , the bonn blackbirds will be able to form a chorus of their own and tour the rest of the country .
this is likely to raise the profile of classical music among birds in general and may even push beethoven to the top of avian pop charts .

years of effort have failed to produce any meaningful social protection in these countries , the g8 ministers acknowledged in a statement at the end of the conference .
recommendations from the meeting were being prepared for the summit hosted by germany next month in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social responsability should be partly compulsory , müntefering said " strengthening and broadening of social protection -lrb- is -rrb- one of the most important tasks in the context of globalization processes , " the statement said , pointing out the value of such standards in combating poverty and promoting economic and social development .
little leverage german labor minister franz müntefering said the g8 as a group was unable to present concrete demands because setting minimum standards for social protection falls under the jurisdiction of individual states .
müntefering said the only possibility was to make agreements " and then canvas support for them to be adhered to ...
you have to appeal to reason . "
to best adapt to the changes in the era of globalization , " it is crucial to enhance flexibility and adequate labor market security for individuals , " the statement said .
" in a globally competitive world , individual countries need to be innovative .
but every successful package requires well-designed employment regulations and contractual arrangements as well as adequate employment-oriented social protection , " the statement said .
representatives from the european commission , the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and the world bank also took part in the conference .
call for social responsibility the conference said that industry could make a contribution to shaping the social dimension of the world economy by taking on a greater social responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden talks were ahead of an upcoming summit in heiligendamm " companies should recognize their responsibility to their workers through the promotion of the rule of law , transparency , good governance , the ending of corruption and implementing sound industrial relations , " the ministers said .
müntefering acknowledged that corporate social responsibility will remain voluntary , but that the issue needs to be addressed by a mixture of " compulsory and non-compulsory " actions .
adequate work protections should be compulsory , he said .
' people should n't live in fear ' " social protection means people should n't live in fear and misery .
aside from needing food and drink , they need social protection for the difficult periods in life , " he said .
brazilian social welfare minister luís marinho addressed the group on tuesday , and made a few jabs at the g8 countries .
he said developing countries were doing all they could to improve conditions , but the g8 needed to do its part , as well .
the ministers officially asked the international labor organization to explain why minimum work standards that were agreed to years ago " have not been meaningfully put into place up to now . "
ilo director-general juan somavia acknowledged that it was difficult to put any meaningful pressure on world governments .
there is no body that can issue motivating sanctions that would apply to member countries , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 labor ministers call for more social engagement by business g8 labor ministers are debating whether to require big businesses to promote social and environmental programs , with the aim of a fairer globalization .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

an advocate of free speech and muslim dialogue , he 's now founded a new party against right-wingers . denmark 's new party , ny alliance -lrb- new alliance -rrb- , has been stirring up the country 's political landscape .
earlier this week , the party officially broke away from the social-liberal party det radikale venstre under the leadership of syrian-born parliamentarian naser khader . " we feel politically homeless and believe that there are many others who feel the same way , " said khader . khader has gained in popularity since a danish newspaper caused an international uproar by publishing caricatures of mohammed in september 2005 .
he founded the association of democratic muslims and advocated dialogue among muslims themselves .
he also appealed to the danish people to differentiate between radical muslims and those with democratic ideals . for some observers , the time seems ripe for a shift toward the left .
according to german denmark expert bernd henningsen , ny alliance has the potential to " bring the country to its senses . " nationalist tendencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper caused an uproar in the muslim world over the past few months , members of the nationalistic dansk folkeparti -lrb- danish people 's party -rrb- have provoked the public with numerous statements against foreigners .
one member of the country 's third strongest party called homosexuality a " sickness . " another parliamentarian found resonance among fellow politicians when he compared the muslim headscarf to the nazi swastika . according to official statements , ny alliance members left the folkeparti in protest of its national rhetoric . if you ca n't beat them … det radikale venstre , which is more center-left on the political spectrum than the name suggests , is no less vocal against the far right than the khader 's group .
what differentiates the newbies , however , is not their stance but their strategy : while det radikale venstre boycotts the government , new alliance wants to join it . members of the new party have offered to partner up in a liberal-conservative coalition under prime minster anders fogh rasmussen of the liberal party after the 2009 national elections .
this would mean sending home the right-wing dansk folkeparti , which the ruling liberal-conservative coalition is dependent on for support . margrethe vestager , vice chairwoman of det radikale venstre , said she regrets khader 's decision to break away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ny alliance wants to build a coalition with current pm rasmussen " we are not interested in a coalition under anders fogh rasmussen , " said vestager .
" his cooperation with the dansk folkeparti and his position on tax policy are not acceptable to us . " support from conservatives in part due to its aim of forming a government coalition , ny alliance can count on support from the conservative camp .
one of the most prominent examples is eu parliamentarian gitte seeberg , who left the konservative folkeparti -lrb- conservative people 's party -rrb- to co-found ny alliance . seeberg said that cooperation with the dansk folkeparti on issues like immigration , the european union and globalization had become nearly impossible . ny alliance , on the other hand , aims for " 100 percent membership in the eu " and stands for a " strict but humanitarian immigration policy , " she added . denmark has one of the tightest asylum policies in europe .
last year , the council of europe criticized the scandinavian country for maintaining " an atmosphere of intolerance and xenophobia . " just a few days after its founding , ny alliance claims to have some 10,500 members already , which would put it on equal ground with its political opponents .

one of the most prominent examples is eu parliamentarian gitte seeberg , who left the konservative folkeparti -lrb- conservative people 's party -rrb- to co-found ny alliance . seeberg said that cooperation with the dansk folkeparti on issues like immigration , the european union and globalization had become nearly impossible . ny alliance , on the other hand , aims for " 100 percent membership in the eu " and stands for a " strict but humanitarian immigration policy , " she added . denmark has one of the tightest asylum policies in europe .
last year , the council of europe criticized the scandinavian country for maintaining " an atmosphere of intolerance and xenophobia . " just a few days after its founding , ny alliance claims to have some 10,500 members already , which would put it on equal ground with its political opponents .
the right-wing dansk folkeparti has about 8,500 members and the social-liberal det radikale venstre has 10,000 . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court acquits satirical french mag over mohammed cartoons a paris court on thursday acquitted the editor of a satirical french weekly , sued by two muslim groups for publishing cartoons of the prophet mohammed .

earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .

he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .
the news magazine focus reported that steinbrück was facing increased demands from the big spending ministries , amounting to seven billion euros in 2008 and a total of 28 billion by 2011 .

earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .
the news magazine focus reported that steinbrück was facing increased demands from the big spending ministries , amounting to seven billion euros in 2008 and a total of 28 billion by 2011 .
focus cited a list from the finance ministry it had seen . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says german deficit sinking fast the european commission said germany 's efforts to clean up its financial house are paying off , with the country expected to pare its budget deficit down to three percent of gross domestic product in 2008 .

it is one of the three most powerful posts in the country and observers say nikolic 's election deepens the political paralysis that has beset serbia .

nikolic 's election , however , comes as serbia battles the prospect of its province of kosovo being awarded independence by the un security council , an issue the radicals have campaigned hard against .
it was an argument over key security posts that handle the kosovo issue and relations with the un tribunal that led to the break up of coalition talks between the parties of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , kostunica and the reformist g17 plus . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united nations envoy says kosovo must stick to his plan the un special envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said he saw no alternative to his proposal for supervised independence for serbian breakaway province kosovo .

the software will identify the paper color , typefaces , any rubber stamps and the outlines of the tears .
just like a jigsaw solver , as soon as it discovers edges that match , it will link up the images .

the job was made easier by the way the stasi officers had manually torn up the papers after their office shredders had broken down .

the software will identify the paper color , typefaces , any rubber stamps and the outlines of the tears .
just like a jigsaw solver , as soon as it discovers edges that match , it will link up the images .
" it 's very exciting to decode stasi papers , " schneider said .
" you have the feeling you are making history . "
the job was made easier by the way the stasi officers had manually torn up the papers after their office shredders had broken down .
when a table would get filled with torn pieces , they were all shoved into one bag before the next lot was torn .
as a result , each sack contains almost a complete set of papers , with practically no mixing of documents between the bags .
before the collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany was a police state as communism collapsed in 1989 , the ministry for state security burned and shredded files and tore others up by hand .
the burning and shredding can not be undone , but the new authorities retrieved the scraps that were semi-intact and only jumbled .
berlin vowed to put the scraps , which are mostly postcard sized , back into the correct order to be read .
the job fell to 15 workers sitting in an office near nürnberg who have managed to work through 323 sacks since 1995 .
with nearly 16,000 more sacks to go , it would take over 400 years to complete the job manually .
in 2003 , the government said it could not afford 50 million euros to computerize the task , so legislators have approved a more modest pilot project .
each scrap will be scanned and a computer will try to match images by shape , jigsaw style , to others from the same sack .
germany has already opened many undamaged stasi files to historians and to former stasi victims , helping them to identify informers in a society that was ruled by the fear of denunciation , but there are big gaps in the archives .
staff working for the custodian of the files , former east german democracy activist marianne birthler , say the funding means 400 more sacks can be processed in the next two years , more than the number reconstituted so far by human intelligence .
new insights expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi archives were already used to expose former spies birthler aide günter bormann said the bags to be scanned and re- assembled appeared to contain files in active use in 1988 and 1989 as the communist system teetered on the brink of collapse .
none are thought to relate to east german espionage abroad : that department 's files were almost completely destroyed .
it is not clear yet what will happen after the pilot project is completed .
undamaged stasi files have already helped to expose many of the turncoats who tried to bury their past when communism fell .
former stasi officers are barred as security risks from many german public offices .
a legislator , klaus-peter willsch , said the documents might help undercover more stasi informers so they can be punished .
he believes all 16,000 sacks could be reconstructed for less than 30 million euros -lrb- 40 million dollars -rrb- . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new exhibition looks at daily life in east germany a new exhibition on east germany has just opened in berlin 's german historical museum .

engelen asked the residents of bonn to download a digital version of the " ode to joy " from beethoven 's " 9th symphony " and use it as their mobile ring tone .
his idea is that if enough cell phone users play the same musical melody every time their mobile rings , male blackbirds will begin to imitate the sound .
that blackbirds have an artistic streak in them has been well-documented by biologists observing their behavior .
male blackbirds are big fans of singing competitions .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teenagers could not imagine a life without cell phones there is probably no easier way to upset a group of sleep-deprived adults on their way to work than to subject them to the ambient sounds of burping crocodiles or robotic squeaks of mexican folk bands singing " la cucaracha " after sniffing helium .
and it 's not as if one can escape the manic world of cell phones .
they are literally everywhere - in restaurants , parks , public transportation and movie theaters .
surely , mobile phones are a means of communication and a symbol of the information overload that characterizes our society .
but they are also much more than that : a tool of self-fashioning and personal expression , according to the fashion mantra of the 21st century : let me hear your cell phone ring and i will tell you what kind of person you are .
it 's not all that bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if beethoven could only hear that even birds know his ode to joy !
cell phones can , however , be used for goals more inspiring than driving your fellow subway-passengers up the wall .
william engelen , for instance , a dutch artist living in germany , may revolutionize the way we think about cell phones .
engelen asked the residents of bonn to download a digital version of the " ode to joy " from beethoven 's " 9th symphony " and use it as their mobile ring tone .
his idea is that if enough cell phone users play the same musical melody every time their mobile rings , male blackbirds will begin to imitate the sound .
that blackbirds have an artistic streak in them has been well-documented by biologists observing their behavior .
male blackbirds are big fans of singing competitions .
in the mother nature 's very own , original version of " avian idol " - later appropriated by humans and turned into an international money-making machine known as " american idol " or " german superstar " - they get to exercise their vocal chords and fight for the prestigious title of the loudest bird on the block .
chicks apparently love it .
that 's why some urban blackbirds can begin to sound like sirens , honking cars or even popular song refrains .
sing it back !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's , like , all of a sudden , everybody has the same ring tone with bonn being the city of birth of ludwig van beethoven , engelen chose to teach birds to chirp the great composer .
the entire project is sponsored by the beethoven foundation and has received quite a bit of publicity locally as a curious artistic intervention in the animal world .
engelen says if it works , he 'll take the project to other cities .
if all goes as planned , the bonn blackbirds will be able to form a chorus of their own and tour the rest of the country .
this is likely to raise the profile of classical music among birds in general and may even push beethoven to the top of avian pop charts .

the summit which opens on june 6 on germany 's baltic coast will see german chancellor angeal merkel hosting the leaders of britain , canada , france , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
climate change and poverty in africa will dominate the agenda .
german politicians and security experts have issued warnings of potential violence ahead of the summit .
" we are particularly focused on dangers arising from violent globalization opponents , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
police targeted members of militant groups police suspect the left-wing militants they are targeting of being behind a string of attacks in and around hamburg and berlin .
last december , a car was set on fire in front of the home of deputy finance minister thomas mirow and the walls of his home were splattered with paint .
the hotel where the summit is to take place has also been vandalized with paint .
on wednesday , the more than 40 raids across the country included one on the leftist " rote flora " cultural center in hamburg amid concerns it was being used by a domestic left-wing radical group .
the investigation also focused on members of the radical communist organization " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- , which has claimed 25 attacks since 2001 .

" we 're talking here about groups who have terrorism potential . "
protest from the far-left anti-globalization groups like gipfelsoli and attac have condemned the raids as " a wave of repression " and " criminalization . "
" all attempts to criminalize us do not change the fact that we will sue the g8 -lrb- summit -rrb- to cast a spotlight on the injustices of this world , " said hanne jobst from gipfelsoli in a statement .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer protection minister horst seehofer wants germans to eat healthy with a five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " the government agreed on wednesday to promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to their nutritional needs .
" this is really simply about what 's the right way to eat , " said germany 's minister for food , agriculture and consumer protection , horst seehofer .
according to government statistics , around 37 million adults and around two million children in germany are overweight .
one fourth of adult germans suffer from cardiovascular diseases , while there are around four million diabetics in the country .
one in five german women and one in seven men have chronic back pain .
the annual costs of treating nutrition-related illnesses amount to 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 95.3 billion -rrb- , which is 30 percent of germany 's overall health costs .
a plan to shape up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health minister ulla schmidt stresses the importance of nutritional education health minister ulla schmidt said that many germans know what constitutes a healthy lifestyle , but are not necessarily actively pursuing it .
" that 's why we need a plan that would involve everybody , " schmidt said .
the government 's obesity prevention strategy calls on politicians , scientists , sports clubs , health-care providers , unions and the food industry to join in the battle to get germans to shape up .
according to the plan , nutritional information should be more readily available on all kinds of food products .
kindergartens , schools , universities and hospitals should also pay more attention to the kinds of food they serve in their cafeterias .
the ultimate goal of the strategy is to improve public health and stop the increasing obesity rates among children by 2020 .
fattest europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but they look so appetizing !
the new initiative was spurred by a study released by the international association for the study of obesity .
it found that among eu countries , germany has the most overweight women and men .
among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight ; 75.4 percent of men tip the scales .
running a close second among women was the uk , where 58.5 percent of women are overweight .
among men , the czech republic came in second .
the thinnest europeans of both sexes live in italy and france .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

however rehn , speaking after talks with turkey 's top eu negotiator ali babacan , said that the european union hoped to open talks with ankara , before the end of june , on three of the 35 policy chapters which must be successfully negotiated prior to membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn " i confirmed ... the goal to open three chapters still under the german -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency , " he told reporters .
portugal will assume the presidency from germany on july 1 .
this marks a major step for turkey 's eu bid as so far it has only opened two chapters , and successfully closed just one .
resumption of talks rehn stressed that the decision in march to resume the membership talks , parts of which were frozen because of turkey 's trade dispute with cyprus , was taken unanimously .
" if one or several members states want to change that negotiating mandate , then it is up to them to take the initiative and also take the responsibility of possible consequences , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy has come out strongly against turkish eu membership he congratulated sarkozy on his election win and added that it was not his task to speculate on whether the election result " is good or bad . "
" i trust that france will stick to its commitments undertaken in the course of the eu accession process , " he added .
the eu opened in march the chapter on " enterprise and industry policy " .
however no more chapters can be closed until turkey drops its long-running trade restrictions against eu member cyprus .
" in my view the best was for the eu to work with turkey in this sensitive and difficult time is by sticking to our commitment , by being firm and fair , " said rehn .
watching the political events european officials are closely watching political events in turkey , amid a crisis over the retention of a secular administration in the largely muslim nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are wary of letting turkey into the bloc turkish lawmakers on monday approved sweeping constitutional reforms that would see the president elected by popular vote , as they sought to resolve the crisis .
on sunday , parliament failed for a second time to elect a president , with an opposition boycott preventing it reaching the required quorum for a vote .
the failure prompted foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist who was the sole candidate , to withdraw his name .
the prospect of gul as president had triggered mass secular protests and a tense stand-off between the islamist-rooted government and the army , which threatened to intervene to protect secularism .
rehn said that a decision on whether turkey should be allowed to join the eu should only be made " closer to completion of the negotiation process , because only then can we see if turkey is able to meet all the legal , democratic and economic criteria . "

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

but they have one thing in common : they want to limit the power of corporations and make sure people have a greater say . maria mies was in seattle in 1999 as ten thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets chanting the slogans " no globalization without participation " and " the world is not for sale .

in his book " die globalisierung und ihre gegner " -lrb- globalization and its critics -rrb- , he separated the groups into five subsets : leftists and radical leftists are interested in social justice and want to develop a different societal system ; the academic left has taken up some ideas from the ecological movement and engages in a certain amount of marxist criticism ; reformers from the business world favor employing a social democratic approach to tame capitalism ; globalization critics grounded in religion link to the churches ' traditions of social reform ; and right-wing opponents to globalization put the stress on the nation state heterogeneity has advantages in addition to large organizations , such as attac , greenpeace , trade unions and churches , innumerable smaller local and regional groups are also part of the struggle , but the varying currents united by one movement is n't problematic , according to leggewie .

his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?

" the chancellor this afternoon called prime minister kostunica and informed him personally of her concern , " ulrich wilhelm said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel hopes that serbia will manage to form a democratic government " she furthermore urged him to use the narrow timeframe still available for forming a democratic government in order to keep serbia 's european prospects alive , " he added .
wilhelm was referring to a looming deadline for serbia 's political parties to form a government following legislative elections in january or face a new vote .
under the balkan state 's constitution , they have until may 14 .
serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic has set a friday deadline for parties that voted in an ultra-nationalist as parliament speaker to show if they have a majority for forming a coalition government .
a powerful post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's ultranationalist radical party leader tomislav nikolic tomislav nikolic , the leader of the serbian radical party which won most votes in the jan .
21 elections , was voted in as parliamentary speaker on tuesday with the support of kostunica 's moderate nationalists .
it is one of the three most powerful posts in the country and observers say nikolic 's election deepens the political paralysis that has beset serbia .
squabbling moderate parties have so far failed to form a coalition , despite fears that new elections could see the extreme nationalists increase their share of the vote .
the radical party was an on-off ally of late authoritarian serbian leader slobodan milosevic 's socialists throughout the balkan wars up until his arrest in 2001 and removal to the un international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
a sensitive moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav kostunica 's moderately nationalist party helped elect nikolic nikolic 's election was also criticized by the council of europe just as belgrade was due to assume on friday the rotating chairmanship of the council 's committee of ministers which groups the 46 member states ' foreign ministers and representatives .
rene van der linden , president of the council 's parliamentary assembly , said that the election of nikolic was " a burden on serbia 's ability to carry out its task " as chairman of the committee .
" the parliamentary assembly 's values are totally opposed to those of mr. nikolic 's party .
given the gravity of this issue , the parliamentary assembly will continue to follow developments closely , " he said .
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president boris tadic set friday as a deadline for the formation of a new government the european union froze rapprochement talks with belgrade a year ago , mainly because of belgrade 's failure to hand former bosnian serb army chief ratko mladic over to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia .
nikolic 's election , however , comes as serbia battles the prospect of its province of kosovo being awarded independence by the un security council , an issue the radicals have campaigned hard against .
it was an argument over key security posts that handle the kosovo issue and relations with the un tribunal that led to the break up of coalition talks between the parties of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , kostunica and the reformist g17 plus . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united nations envoy says kosovo must stick to his plan the un special envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said he saw no alternative to his proposal for supervised independence for serbian breakaway province kosovo .

" the chancellor this afternoon called prime minister kostunica and informed him personally of her concern , " ulrich wilhelm said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel hopes that serbia will manage to form a democratic government " she furthermore urged him to use the narrow timeframe still available for forming a democratic government in order to keep serbia 's european prospects alive , " he added .
wilhelm was referring to a looming deadline for serbia 's political parties to form a government following legislative elections in january or face a new vote .

it is one of the three most powerful posts in the country and observers say nikolic 's election deepens the political paralysis that has beset serbia .
squabbling moderate parties have so far failed to form a coalition , despite fears that new elections could see the extreme nationalists increase their share of the vote .

nikolic 's election , however , comes as serbia battles the prospect of its province of kosovo being awarded independence by the un security council , an issue the radicals have campaigned hard against .

the software will identify the paper color , typefaces , any rubber stamps and the outlines of the tears .
just like a jigsaw solver , as soon as it discovers edges that match , it will link up the images .
" it 's very exciting to decode stasi papers , " schneider said .
" you have the feeling you are making history . "
the job was made easier by the way the stasi officers had manually torn up the papers after their office shredders had broken down .
when a table would get filled with torn pieces , they were all shoved into one bag before the next lot was torn .
as a result , each sack contains almost a complete set of papers , with practically no mixing of documents between the bags .
before the collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany was a police state as communism collapsed in 1989 , the ministry for state security burned and shredded files and tore others up by hand .
the burning and shredding can not be undone , but the new authorities retrieved the scraps that were semi-intact and only jumbled .
berlin vowed to put the scraps , which are mostly postcard sized , back into the correct order to be read .
the job fell to 15 workers sitting in an office near nürnberg who have managed to work through 323 sacks since 1995 .
with nearly 16,000 more sacks to go , it would take over 400 years to complete the job manually .

the software will identify the paper color , typefaces , any rubber stamps and the outlines of the tears .
just like a jigsaw solver , as soon as it discovers edges that match , it will link up the images .
" it 's very exciting to decode stasi papers , " schneider said .
" you have the feeling you are making history . "
the job was made easier by the way the stasi officers had manually torn up the papers after their office shredders had broken down .
when a table would get filled with torn pieces , they were all shoved into one bag before the next lot was torn .
as a result , each sack contains almost a complete set of papers , with practically no mixing of documents between the bags .

berlin vowed to put the scraps , which are mostly postcard sized , back into the correct order to be read .
the job fell to 15 workers sitting in an office near nürnberg who have managed to work through 323 sacks since 1995 .

the software will identify the paper color , typefaces , any rubber stamps and the outlines of the tears .
just like a jigsaw solver , as soon as it discovers edges that match , it will link up the images .
" it 's very exciting to decode stasi papers , " schneider said .
" you have the feeling you are making history . "
the job was made easier by the way the stasi officers had manually torn up the papers after their office shredders had broken down .
when a table would get filled with torn pieces , they were all shoved into one bag before the next lot was torn .
as a result , each sack contains almost a complete set of papers , with practically no mixing of documents between the bags .
before the collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany was a police state as communism collapsed in 1989 , the ministry for state security burned and shredded files and tore others up by hand .
the burning and shredding can not be undone , but the new authorities retrieved the scraps that were semi-intact and only jumbled .
berlin vowed to put the scraps , which are mostly postcard sized , back into the correct order to be read .
the job fell to 15 workers sitting in an office near nürnberg who have managed to work through 323 sacks since 1995 .
with nearly 16,000 more sacks to go , it would take over 400 years to complete the job manually .
in 2003 , the government said it could not afford 50 million euros to computerize the task , so legislators have approved a more modest pilot project .
each scrap will be scanned and a computer will try to match images by shape , jigsaw style , to others from the same sack .
germany has already opened many undamaged stasi files to historians and to former stasi victims , helping them to identify informers in a society that was ruled by the fear of denunciation , but there are big gaps in the archives .
staff working for the custodian of the files , former east german democracy activist marianne birthler , say the funding means 400 more sacks can be processed in the next two years , more than the number reconstituted so far by human intelligence .
new insights expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi archives were already used to expose former spies birthler aide günter bormann said the bags to be scanned and re- assembled appeared to contain files in active use in 1988 and 1989 as the communist system teetered on the brink of collapse .
none are thought to relate to east german espionage abroad : that department 's files were almost completely destroyed .
it is not clear yet what will happen after the pilot project is completed .
undamaged stasi files have already helped to expose many of the turncoats who tried to bury their past when communism fell .
former stasi officers are barred as security risks from many german public offices .
a legislator , klaus-peter willsch , said the documents might help undercover more stasi informers so they can be punished .
he believes all 16,000 sacks could be reconstructed for less than 30 million euros -lrb- 40 million dollars -rrb- . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new exhibition looks at daily life in east germany a new exhibition on east germany has just opened in berlin 's german historical museum .

engelen asked the residents of bonn to download a digital version of the " ode to joy " from beethoven 's " 9th symphony " and use it as their mobile ring tone .
his idea is that if enough cell phone users play the same musical melody every time their mobile rings , male blackbirds will begin to imitate the sound .
that blackbirds have an artistic streak in them has been well-documented by biologists observing their behavior .
male blackbirds are big fans of singing competitions .
in the mother nature 's very own , original version of " avian idol " - later appropriated by humans and turned into an international money-making machine known as " american idol " or " german superstar " - they get to exercise their vocal chords and fight for the prestigious title of the loudest bird on the block .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teenagers could not imagine a life without cell phones there is probably no easier way to upset a group of sleep-deprived adults on their way to work than to subject them to the ambient sounds of burping crocodiles or robotic squeaks of mexican folk bands singing " la cucaracha " after sniffing helium .
and it 's not as if one can escape the manic world of cell phones .
they are literally everywhere - in restaurants , parks , public transportation and movie theaters .
surely , mobile phones are a means of communication and a symbol of the information overload that characterizes our society .
but they are also much more than that : a tool of self-fashioning and personal expression , according to the fashion mantra of the 21st century : let me hear your cell phone ring and i will tell you what kind of person you are .
it 's not all that bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if beethoven could only hear that even birds know his ode to joy !
cell phones can , however , be used for goals more inspiring than driving your fellow subway-passengers up the wall .
william engelen , for instance , a dutch artist living in germany , may revolutionize the way we think about cell phones .
engelen asked the residents of bonn to download a digital version of the " ode to joy " from beethoven 's " 9th symphony " and use it as their mobile ring tone .
his idea is that if enough cell phone users play the same musical melody every time their mobile rings , male blackbirds will begin to imitate the sound .
that blackbirds have an artistic streak in them has been well-documented by biologists observing their behavior .
male blackbirds are big fans of singing competitions .
in the mother nature 's very own , original version of " avian idol " - later appropriated by humans and turned into an international money-making machine known as " american idol " or " german superstar " - they get to exercise their vocal chords and fight for the prestigious title of the loudest bird on the block .
chicks apparently love it .
that 's why some urban blackbirds can begin to sound like sirens , honking cars or even popular song refrains .
sing it back !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's , like , all of a sudden , everybody has the same ring tone with bonn being the city of birth of ludwig van beethoven , engelen chose to teach birds to chirp the great composer .
the entire project is sponsored by the beethoven foundation and has received quite a bit of publicity locally as a curious artistic intervention in the animal world .
engelen says if it works , he 'll take the project to other cities .
if all goes as planned , the bonn blackbirds will be able to form a chorus of their own and tour the rest of the country .
this is likely to raise the profile of classical music among birds in general and may even push beethoven to the top of avian pop charts .

" we suspect those targeted , who belong to the militant extreme-left scene , of founding a terrorist organisation or being members of such an organisation , that is planning arson attacks and other actions to severely disrupt or prevent the early-summer g8 summit in heiligendamm from taking place , " the prosecutor 's office said .
the summit which opens on june 6 on germany 's baltic coast will see german chancellor angeal merkel hosting the leaders of britain , canada , france , italy , japan , russia and the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 09.05.2007 turkey set for fresh membership talks with eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : membership talks will go on , but eu officials are watching political events closely eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn on tuesday played down concerns that nicolas sarkozy , french president-elect , would stop turkey 's membership bid , adding that new talks with ankara could begin within weeks . sarkozy , who triumphed in france 's presidential election on sunday , is staunchly opposed to turkey joining the 27-member bloc , arguing that most of turkey 's territory is in asia .
however rehn , speaking after talks with turkey 's top eu negotiator ali babacan , said that the european union hoped to open talks with ankara , before the end of june , on three of the 35 policy chapters which must be successfully negotiated prior to membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn " i confirmed ... the goal to open three chapters still under the german -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency , " he told reporters .
portugal will assume the presidency from germany on july 1 .
this marks a major step for turkey 's eu bid as so far it has only opened two chapters , and successfully closed just one .
resumption of talks rehn stressed that the decision in march to resume the membership talks , parts of which were frozen because of turkey 's trade dispute with cyprus , was taken unanimously .
" if one or several members states want to change that negotiating mandate , then it is up to them to take the initiative and also take the responsibility of possible consequences , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy has come out strongly against turkish eu membership he congratulated sarkozy on his election win and added that it was not his task to speculate on whether the election result " is good or bad . "
" i trust that france will stick to its commitments undertaken in the course of the eu accession process , " he added .
the eu opened in march the chapter on " enterprise and industry policy " .
however no more chapters can be closed until turkey drops its long-running trade restrictions against eu member cyprus .
" in my view the best was for the eu to work with turkey in this sensitive and difficult time is by sticking to our commitment , by being firm and fair , " said rehn .
watching the political events european officials are closely watching political events in turkey , amid a crisis over the retention of a secular administration in the largely muslim nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are wary of letting turkey into the bloc turkish lawmakers on monday approved sweeping constitutional reforms that would see the president elected by popular vote , as they sought to resolve the crisis .
on sunday , parliament failed for a second time to elect a president , with an opposition boycott preventing it reaching the required quorum for a vote .
the failure prompted foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist who was the sole candidate , to withdraw his name .
the prospect of gul as president had triggered mass secular protests and a tense stand-off between the islamist-rooted government and the army , which threatened to intervene to protect secularism .
rehn said that a decision on whether turkey should be allowed to join the eu should only be made " closer to completion of the negotiation process , because only then can we see if turkey is able to meet all the legal , democratic and economic criteria . "
a european commission spokeswoman said the three new accession chapters concerned were on economic and monetary affairs , statistics and financial control . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and erdogan reconcile after turkish eu criticism german chancellor angela merkel met turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan in hanover and made their peace after the turkish leader made critical comments about german efforts in regard to turkey 's eu accession .

however rehn , speaking after talks with turkey 's top eu negotiator ali babacan , said that the european union hoped to open talks with ankara , before the end of june , on three of the 35 policy chapters which must be successfully negotiated prior to membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn " i confirmed ... the goal to open three chapters still under the german -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency , " he told reporters .
portugal will assume the presidency from germany on july 1 .
this marks a major step for turkey 's eu bid as so far it has only opened two chapters , and successfully closed just one .
resumption of talks rehn stressed that the decision in march to resume the membership talks , parts of which were frozen because of turkey 's trade dispute with cyprus , was taken unanimously .
" if one or several members states want to change that negotiating mandate , then it is up to them to take the initiative and also take the responsibility of possible consequences , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy has come out strongly against turkish eu membership he congratulated sarkozy on his election win and added that it was not his task to speculate on whether the election result " is good or bad . "
" i trust that france will stick to its commitments undertaken in the course of the eu accession process , " he added .
the eu opened in march the chapter on " enterprise and industry policy " .
however no more chapters can be closed until turkey drops its long-running trade restrictions against eu member cyprus .
" in my view the best was for the eu to work with turkey in this sensitive and difficult time is by sticking to our commitment , by being firm and fair , " said rehn .
watching the political events european officials are closely watching political events in turkey , amid a crisis over the retention of a secular administration in the largely muslim nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are wary of letting turkey into the bloc turkish lawmakers on monday approved sweeping constitutional reforms that would see the president elected by popular vote , as they sought to resolve the crisis .
on sunday , parliament failed for a second time to elect a president , with an opposition boycott preventing it reaching the required quorum for a vote .
the failure prompted foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist who was the sole candidate , to withdraw his name .
the prospect of gul as president had triggered mass secular protests and a tense stand-off between the islamist-rooted government and the army , which threatened to intervene to protect secularism .
rehn said that a decision on whether turkey should be allowed to join the eu should only be made " closer to completion of the negotiation process , because only then can we see if turkey is able to meet all the legal , democratic and economic criteria . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.05.2007 german finance minister under pressure to align budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's budget is becoming less of a black hole politicians are calling for finance minister peer steinbrück to balance germany 's budget by 2009 .
earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .

earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .

" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .

earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .
the news magazine focus reported that steinbrück was facing increased demands from the big spending ministries , amounting to seven billion euros in 2008 and a total of 28 billion by 2011 .

an advocate of free speech and muslim dialogue , he 's now founded a new party against right-wingers . denmark 's new party , ny alliance -lrb- new alliance -rrb- , has been stirring up the country 's political landscape .
earlier this week , the party officially broke away from the social-liberal party det radikale venstre under the leadership of syrian-born parliamentarian naser khader . " we feel politically homeless and believe that there are many others who feel the same way , " said khader . khader has gained in popularity since a danish newspaper caused an international uproar by publishing caricatures of mohammed in september 2005 .
he founded the association of democratic muslims and advocated dialogue among muslims themselves .
he also appealed to the danish people to differentiate between radical muslims and those with democratic ideals . for some observers , the time seems ripe for a shift toward the left .
according to german denmark expert bernd henningsen , ny alliance has the potential to " bring the country to its senses . " nationalist tendencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper caused an uproar in the muslim world over the past few months , members of the nationalistic dansk folkeparti -lrb- danish people 's party -rrb- have provoked the public with numerous statements against foreigners .
one member of the country 's third strongest party called homosexuality a " sickness . " another parliamentarian found resonance among fellow politicians when he compared the muslim headscarf to the nazi swastika . according to official statements , ny alliance members left the folkeparti in protest of its national rhetoric . if you ca n't beat them … det radikale venstre , which is more center-left on the political spectrum than the name suggests , is no less vocal against the far right than the khader 's group .
what differentiates the newbies , however , is not their stance but their strategy : while det radikale venstre boycotts the government , new alliance wants to join it . members of the new party have offered to partner up in a liberal-conservative coalition under prime minster anders fogh rasmussen of the liberal party after the 2009 national elections .
this would mean sending home the right-wing dansk folkeparti , which the ruling liberal-conservative coalition is dependent on for support . margrethe vestager , vice chairwoman of det radikale venstre , said she regrets khader 's decision to break away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ny alliance wants to build a coalition with current pm rasmussen " we are not interested in a coalition under anders fogh rasmussen , " said vestager .
" his cooperation with the dansk folkeparti and his position on tax policy are not acceptable to us . " support from conservatives in part due to its aim of forming a government coalition , ny alliance can count on support from the conservative camp .
one of the most prominent examples is eu parliamentarian gitte seeberg , who left the konservative folkeparti -lrb- conservative people 's party -rrb- to co-found ny alliance . seeberg said that cooperation with the dansk folkeparti on issues like immigration , the european union and globalization had become nearly impossible . ny alliance , on the other hand , aims for " 100 percent membership in the eu " and stands for a " strict but humanitarian immigration policy , " she added . denmark has one of the tightest asylum policies in europe .
last year , the council of europe criticized the scandinavian country for maintaining " an atmosphere of intolerance and xenophobia . " just a few days after its founding , ny alliance claims to have some 10,500 members already , which would put it on equal ground with its political opponents .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opposition -pipe- 09.05.2007 strength in numbers for globalization 's critics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protesters want freedom , prosperity and equality for all environmentalists , churches , trade unions - globalization 's opponents have many faces .
but they have one thing in common : they want to limit the power of corporations and make sure people have a greater say . maria mies was in seattle in 1999 as ten thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets chanting the slogans " no globalization without participation " and " the world is not for sale . " trade unions , church groups , environmentalists , women 's movements and third world groups protested against a new round of liberalization of world trade .
a retired sociology professor and member of the organization attac , which is critical of globalization , mies said she was aware of the many faces of the anti-globalization movement . " there were also poor people , farmers and -lrb- blue-collar -rrb- workers who took part spontaneously , " she said .
" there were indeed different groups , but they all were fed up and knew what they did n't want anymore . " the movement considers the promise that globalization will bring the world peace , equality , freedom and prosperity to be a lie .
they believe that poor countries in particular suffer from corporations ' pursuit of growth and are forced into poverty and dependency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working conditions in the mines of multinationals in africa are often poor opponents of globalization say companies scale down social achievements , such as minimum wages and occupational health and safety , using the argument that they must remain internationally competitive .
opposition groups demand guarantees for people 's right to self-determination and for minimum of social standards and want to change international trade agreements to favor developing countries .
more say for the people mies said democracy is globalization 's first victim , adding that the movement 's central demand for people to become more involved in political decisions has remain unchanged .
" that 's no longer possible in a globalized world controlled by multinational corporations , " said mies .
" national laws can not simply be tossed aside when a few companies lobby brussels . " political scientist claus leggewie said those opposed to globalization could be divided into five groups .
in his book " die globalisierung und ihre gegner " -lrb- globalization and its critics -rrb- , he separated the groups into five subsets : leftists and radical leftists are interested in social justice and want to develop a different societal system ; the academic left has taken up some ideas from the ecological movement and engages in a certain amount of marxist criticism ; reformers from the business world favor employing a social democratic approach to tame capitalism ; globalization critics grounded in religion link to the churches ' traditions of social reform ; and right-wing opponents to globalization put the stress on the nation state heterogeneity has advantages in addition to large organizations , such as attac , greenpeace , trade unions and churches , innumerable smaller local and regional groups are also part of the struggle , but the varying currents united by one movement is n't problematic , according to leggewie . " a movement is characterized precisely by a high level of heterogeneity and loose connections , " he said , adding that it allows the movement to distribute various tasks .
the groups aiming for reform had their target audiences just as the radical and militant groups that organize protests did . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent protesters are a minority among the critics of globalization churches made opponents of globalization capable of action by providing financing , infrastructure and organizational skills needed by a movement low on resources before trade unions or political parties get involved , leggewie said . despite their different perspectives , the groups must see their work as being interrelated , according to mies .
no progress could be made if economic factors are viewed as being unconnected to the environment issues , she said . leggewie , however , said the movement could already chalk up a huge success .
" worldwide , there 's no one anymore who pursues globalization as it was in the 1990s , " he said .
" all of the criticism that is warranted is mainstream today - such as criticism of the ecological consequences of unfettered globalization . " christine elsaeßer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turning globalization on its head globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe .
-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within europe 's radical left-wing groups are at the forefront of demonstrations against international injustice .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

the software will identify the paper color , typefaces , any rubber stamps and the outlines of the tears .
just like a jigsaw solver , as soon as it discovers edges that match , it will link up the images .
" it 's very exciting to decode stasi papers , " schneider said .
" you have the feeling you are making history . "
the job was made easier by the way the stasi officers had manually torn up the papers after their office shredders had broken down .

as a result , each sack contains almost a complete set of papers , with practically no mixing of documents between the bags .

the burning and shredding can not be undone , but the new authorities retrieved the scraps that were semi-intact and only jumbled .
berlin vowed to put the scraps , which are mostly postcard sized , back into the correct order to be read .
the job fell to 15 workers sitting in an office near nürnberg who have managed to work through 323 sacks since 1995 .
with nearly 16,000 more sacks to go , it would take over 400 years to complete the job manually .
in 2003 , the government said it could not afford 50 million euros to computerize the task , so legislators have approved a more modest pilot project .
each scrap will be scanned and a computer will try to match images by shape , jigsaw style , to others from the same sack .
germany has already opened many undamaged stasi files to historians and to former stasi victims , helping them to identify informers in a society that was ruled by the fear of denunciation , but there are big gaps in the archives .
staff working for the custodian of the files , former east german democracy activist marianne birthler , say the funding means 400 more sacks can be processed in the next two years , more than the number reconstituted so far by human intelligence .
new insights expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi archives were already used to expose former spies birthler aide günter bormann said the bags to be scanned and re- assembled appeared to contain files in active use in 1988 and 1989 as the communist system teetered on the brink of collapse .

" the chancellor this afternoon called prime minister kostunica and informed him personally of her concern , " ulrich wilhelm said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel hopes that serbia will manage to form a democratic government " she furthermore urged him to use the narrow timeframe still available for forming a democratic government in order to keep serbia 's european prospects alive , " he added .
wilhelm was referring to a looming deadline for serbia 's political parties to form a government following legislative elections in january or face a new vote .
under the balkan state 's constitution , they have until may 14 .
serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic has set a friday deadline for parties that voted in an ultra-nationalist as parliament speaker to show if they have a majority for forming a coalition government .
a powerful post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's ultranationalist radical party leader tomislav nikolic tomislav nikolic , the leader of the serbian radical party which won most votes in the jan .
21 elections , was voted in as parliamentary speaker on tuesday with the support of kostunica 's moderate nationalists .
it is one of the three most powerful posts in the country and observers say nikolic 's election deepens the political paralysis that has beset serbia .
squabbling moderate parties have so far failed to form a coalition , despite fears that new elections could see the extreme nationalists increase their share of the vote .
the radical party was an on-off ally of late authoritarian serbian leader slobodan milosevic 's socialists throughout the balkan wars up until his arrest in 2001 and removal to the un international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
a sensitive moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav kostunica 's moderately nationalist party helped elect nikolic nikolic 's election was also criticized by the council of europe just as belgrade was due to assume on friday the rotating chairmanship of the council 's committee of ministers which groups the 46 member states ' foreign ministers and representatives .
rene van der linden , president of the council 's parliamentary assembly , said that the election of nikolic was " a burden on serbia 's ability to carry out its task " as chairman of the committee .
" the parliamentary assembly 's values are totally opposed to those of mr. nikolic 's party .
given the gravity of this issue , the parliamentary assembly will continue to follow developments closely , " he said .
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president boris tadic set friday as a deadline for the formation of a new government the european union froze rapprochement talks with belgrade a year ago , mainly because of belgrade 's failure to hand former bosnian serb army chief ratko mladic over to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia .
nikolic 's election , however , comes as serbia battles the prospect of its province of kosovo being awarded independence by the un security council , an issue the radicals have campaigned hard against .
it was an argument over key security posts that handle the kosovo issue and relations with the un tribunal that led to the break up of coalition talks between the parties of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , kostunica and the reformist g17 plus . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united nations envoy says kosovo must stick to his plan the un special envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said he saw no alternative to his proposal for supervised independence for serbian breakaway province kosovo .

some of the world 's most promising young violin makers go to mittenwald , nestled in the lush foothills at the southernmost tip of bavaria , to learn the secrets of fashioning the musician 's greatest asset - the instrument itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school is housed in a historical building from 1893 mittenwald , now a village with around 8,000 residents , has a long tradition of musical handcrafts .

visitors to mittenwald will find a statue on the town 's market square commemorating the renowned instrument builder .
hanging on to tradition in the 19th century , competition between violin makers became increasingly tough due to the use of new mass production methods .
to preserve the tradition and art of entirely handmade instruments , bavarian elector maximilian i commissioned a school for young violin makers in 1858 .
the mittenwald school for violin making , located in the same building since 1893 , still trains the next generation of artisans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students complete seven instruments in as many semesters of study at any given time , between 80 and 100 protégés attend the school , which offers a particularly rigorous seven-semester curriculum that includes each step of the building process .
around 40 students study violin building , while the others learn to make plucked string instruments -lrb- like guitars and mandolins -rrb- , bows , wind instruments or brass instruments .
all of the school 's graduates find jobs in their chosen trade , said a school representative .
many open private instrument-making studios , while others may choose to work in museums , restoring old instruments .
visitors can learn more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violin makers must be able to play their creations , too though tours of the school and the workshops are n't officially offered , the school said it would gladly show around student groups , musicians and even tourists who call ahead of time .
for those interested in more detailed information about violin making and the history of the craft in the mittenwald region , the village offers a museum with exhibits on the building process , matthias klotz and the significance of violin making in mittenwald over the past few centuries .
mittenwald 's museum of violin making is open tuesday through saturday from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm in the peak season , and 11:00 am to 4:00 pm in the off season . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin philharmonic celebrates 125th anniversary a may day concert in berlin conducted by sir simon rattle marked the 125th anniversary of the founding of one of the world 's top orchestras , the berlin philharmonic .

the summit which opens on june 6 on germany 's baltic coast will see german chancellor angeal merkel hosting the leaders of britain , canada , france , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
climate change and poverty in africa will dominate the agenda .
german politicians and security experts have issued warnings of potential violence ahead of the summit .
" we are particularly focused on dangers arising from violent globalization opponents , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
police targeted members of militant groups police suspect the left-wing militants they are targeting of being behind a string of attacks in and around hamburg and berlin .
last december , a car was set on fire in front of the home of deputy finance minister thomas mirow and the walls of his home were splattered with paint .
the hotel where the summit is to take place has also been vandalized with paint .
on wednesday , the more than 40 raids across the country included one on the leftist " rote flora " cultural center in hamburg amid concerns it was being used by a domestic left-wing radical group .
the investigation also focused on members of the radical communist organization " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- , which has claimed 25 attacks since 2001 .
most have involved setting fire to a building or vehicle belonging to the police or other public institution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing demonstrators protest against the g8 summit in berlin on may 1 , 2007 in past letters claiming responsibility for crimes , mg has named disrupting the upcoming g8 conference as a motive .
" we 're not dealing here with some left-wing loonies who want to throw a bucket of paint , " the online version of news magazine der spiegel quoted an investigator involved in the raids as saying .
" we 're talking here about groups who have terrorism potential . "
protest from the far-left anti-globalization groups like gipfelsoli and attac have condemned the raids as " a wave of repression " and " criminalization . "
" all attempts to criminalize us do not change the fact that we will sue the g8 -lrb- summit -rrb- to cast a spotlight on the injustices of this world , " said hanne jobst from gipfelsoli in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arson and vandalism are the main crimes from militant left-wing groups germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , however , has said that he sees a clear security threat .
he has announced has announced a tightening of border controls ahead of the summit .
that will mean that the country 's visa-free travel policy for schengen zone members would be suspended during the event , as it was during the soccer world cup last summer .
police are bracing for an expected 100,000 demonstrators to gather in the area near the summit venue , a luxury hotel in heiligendamm on the baltic coast , on june 6-8 .
tight security measures are in the works , including a 12 kilometer -lrb- 7.5 mile -rrb- long fence designed to protect diplomats attending the event .
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed in riots . demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 aims to link aid , social standards in developing world labor and employment ministers from the world 's richest nations appealed to developing countries and emerging economies to improve social standards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 09.05.2007 computers restore ripped-up east german files großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of stasi files resembles a giant jigsaw puzzle a project using computers to reconstruct ripped-up files kept by former east germany 's stasi secret police began on wednesday , raising hopes that more communist misdeeds will be brought to light . the pilot project , backed by 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 8.6 million -rrb- in federal funds , will demonstrate whether it is feasible for the berlin-based fraunhofer institute for production machinery and building technology to use digital brute force to decipher 16,000 sacks of shredded papers that were left behind by former east germany 's powerful secret police . jan schneider , 36 , the fraunhofer engineer heading the project , said the scraps will be placed on a conveyer belt leading to digital scanners which would obtain images of both sides of the paper .
the software will identify the paper color , typefaces , any rubber stamps and the outlines of the tears .
just like a jigsaw solver , as soon as it discovers edges that match , it will link up the images .
" it 's very exciting to decode stasi papers , " schneider said .
" you have the feeling you are making history . "
the job was made easier by the way the stasi officers had manually torn up the papers after their office shredders had broken down .
when a table would get filled with torn pieces , they were all shoved into one bag before the next lot was torn .
as a result , each sack contains almost a complete set of papers , with practically no mixing of documents between the bags .
before the collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany was a police state as communism collapsed in 1989 , the ministry for state security burned and shredded files and tore others up by hand .
the burning and shredding can not be undone , but the new authorities retrieved the scraps that were semi-intact and only jumbled .
berlin vowed to put the scraps , which are mostly postcard sized , back into the correct order to be read .
the job fell to 15 workers sitting in an office near nürnberg who have managed to work through 323 sacks since 1995 .
with nearly 16,000 more sacks to go , it would take over 400 years to complete the job manually .
in 2003 , the government said it could not afford 50 million euros to computerize the task , so legislators have approved a more modest pilot project .
each scrap will be scanned and a computer will try to match images by shape , jigsaw style , to others from the same sack .
germany has already opened many undamaged stasi files to historians and to former stasi victims , helping them to identify informers in a society that was ruled by the fear of denunciation , but there are big gaps in the archives .
staff working for the custodian of the files , former east german democracy activist marianne birthler , say the funding means 400 more sacks can be processed in the next two years , more than the number reconstituted so far by human intelligence .
new insights expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi archives were already used to expose former spies birthler aide günter bormann said the bags to be scanned and re- assembled appeared to contain files in active use in 1988 and 1989 as the communist system teetered on the brink of collapse .
none are thought to relate to east german espionage abroad : that department 's files were almost completely destroyed .
it is not clear yet what will happen after the pilot project is completed .
undamaged stasi files have already helped to expose many of the turncoats who tried to bury their past when communism fell .
former stasi officers are barred as security risks from many german public offices .
a legislator , klaus-peter willsch , said the documents might help undercover more stasi informers so they can be punished .
he believes all 16,000 sacks could be reconstructed for less than 30 million euros -lrb- 40 million dollars -rrb- . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new exhibition looks at daily life in east germany a new exhibition on east germany has just opened in berlin 's german historical museum .

william engelen , for instance , a dutch artist living in germany , may revolutionize the way we think about cell phones .
engelen asked the residents of bonn to download a digital version of the " ode to joy " from beethoven 's " 9th symphony " and use it as their mobile ring tone .
his idea is that if enough cell phone users play the same musical melody every time their mobile rings , male blackbirds will begin to imitate the sound .
that blackbirds have an artistic streak in them has been well-documented by biologists observing their behavior .
male blackbirds are big fans of singing competitions .

" we suspect those targeted , who belong to the militant extreme-left scene , of founding a terrorist organisation or being members of such an organisation , that is planning arson attacks and other actions to severely disrupt or prevent the early-summer g8 summit in heiligendamm from taking place , " the prosecutor 's office said .
the summit which opens on june 6 on germany 's baltic coast will see german chancellor angeal merkel hosting the leaders of britain , canada , france , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
climate change and poverty in africa will dominate the agenda .
german politicians and security experts have issued warnings of potential violence ahead of the summit .
" we are particularly focused on dangers arising from violent globalization opponents , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
police targeted members of militant groups police suspect the left-wing militants they are targeting of being behind a string of attacks in and around hamburg and berlin .
last december , a car was set on fire in front of the home of deputy finance minister thomas mirow and the walls of his home were splattered with paint .
the hotel where the summit is to take place has also been vandalized with paint .
on wednesday , the more than 40 raids across the country included one on the leftist " rote flora " cultural center in hamburg amid concerns it was being used by a domestic left-wing radical group .
the investigation also focused on members of the radical communist organization " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- , which has claimed 25 attacks since 2001 .
most have involved setting fire to a building or vehicle belonging to the police or other public institution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing demonstrators protest against the g8 summit in berlin on may 1 , 2007 in past letters claiming responsibility for crimes , mg has named disrupting the upcoming g8 conference as a motive .
" we 're not dealing here with some left-wing loonies who want to throw a bucket of paint , " the online version of news magazine der spiegel quoted an investigator involved in the raids as saying .
" we 're talking here about groups who have terrorism potential . "
protest from the far-left anti-globalization groups like gipfelsoli and attac have condemned the raids as " a wave of repression " and " criminalization . "
" all attempts to criminalize us do not change the fact that we will sue the g8 -lrb- summit -rrb- to cast a spotlight on the injustices of this world , " said hanne jobst from gipfelsoli in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arson and vandalism are the main crimes from militant left-wing groups germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , however , has said that he sees a clear security threat .
he has announced has announced a tightening of border controls ahead of the summit .
that will mean that the country 's visa-free travel policy for schengen zone members would be suspended during the event , as it was during the soccer world cup last summer .
police are bracing for an expected 100,000 demonstrators to gather in the area near the summit venue , a luxury hotel in heiligendamm on the baltic coast , on june 6-8 .
tight security measures are in the works , including a 12 kilometer -lrb- 7.5 mile -rrb- long fence designed to protect diplomats attending the event .
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed in riots . demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 aims to link aid , social standards in developing world labor and employment ministers from the world 's richest nations appealed to developing countries and emerging economies to improve social standards .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer protection minister horst seehofer wants germans to eat healthy with a five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " the government agreed on wednesday to promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to their nutritional needs .
" this is really simply about what 's the right way to eat , " said germany 's minister for food , agriculture and consumer protection , horst seehofer .
according to government statistics , around 37 million adults and around two million children in germany are overweight .
one fourth of adult germans suffer from cardiovascular diseases , while there are around four million diabetics in the country .
one in five german women and one in seven men have chronic back pain .
the annual costs of treating nutrition-related illnesses amount to 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 95.3 billion -rrb- , which is 30 percent of germany 's overall health costs .
a plan to shape up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health minister ulla schmidt stresses the importance of nutritional education health minister ulla schmidt said that many germans know what constitutes a healthy lifestyle , but are not necessarily actively pursuing it .
" that 's why we need a plan that would involve everybody , " schmidt said .
the government 's obesity prevention strategy calls on politicians , scientists , sports clubs , health-care providers , unions and the food industry to join in the battle to get germans to shape up .
according to the plan , nutritional information should be more readily available on all kinds of food products .
kindergartens , schools , universities and hospitals should also pay more attention to the kinds of food they serve in their cafeterias .
the ultimate goal of the strategy is to improve public health and stop the increasing obesity rates among children by 2020 .

among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight ; 75.4 percent of men tip the scales .
running a close second among women was the uk , where 58.5 percent of women are overweight .
among men , the czech republic came in second .
the thinnest europeans of both sexes live in italy and france .

" the chancellor this afternoon called prime minister kostunica and informed him personally of her concern , " ulrich wilhelm said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel hopes that serbia will manage to form a democratic government " she furthermore urged him to use the narrow timeframe still available for forming a democratic government in order to keep serbia 's european prospects alive , " he added .
wilhelm was referring to a looming deadline for serbia 's political parties to form a government following legislative elections in january or face a new vote .
under the balkan state 's constitution , they have until may 14 .
serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic has set a friday deadline for parties that voted in an ultra-nationalist as parliament speaker to show if they have a majority for forming a coalition government .

21 elections , was voted in as parliamentary speaker on tuesday with the support of kostunica 's moderate nationalists .
it is one of the three most powerful posts in the country and observers say nikolic 's election deepens the political paralysis that has beset serbia .
squabbling moderate parties have so far failed to form a coalition , despite fears that new elections could see the extreme nationalists increase their share of the vote .
the radical party was an on-off ally of late authoritarian serbian leader slobodan milosevic 's socialists throughout the balkan wars up until his arrest in 2001 and removal to the un international war crimes tribunal in the hague .

rene van der linden , president of the council 's parliamentary assembly , said that the election of nikolic was " a burden on serbia 's ability to carry out its task " as chairman of the committee .
" the parliamentary assembly 's values are totally opposed to those of mr. nikolic 's party .

the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president boris tadic set friday as a deadline for the formation of a new government the european union froze rapprochement talks with belgrade a year ago , mainly because of belgrade 's failure to hand former bosnian serb army chief ratko mladic over to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia .
nikolic 's election , however , comes as serbia battles the prospect of its province of kosovo being awarded independence by the un security council , an issue the radicals have campaigned hard against .
it was an argument over key security posts that handle the kosovo issue and relations with the un tribunal that led to the break up of coalition talks between the parties of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , kostunica and the reformist g17 plus . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united nations envoy says kosovo must stick to his plan the un special envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said he saw no alternative to his proposal for supervised independence for serbian breakaway province kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 09.05.2007 turkey set for fresh membership talks with eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : membership talks will go on , but eu officials are watching political events closely eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn on tuesday played down concerns that nicolas sarkozy , french president-elect , would stop turkey 's membership bid , adding that new talks with ankara could begin within weeks . sarkozy , who triumphed in france 's presidential election on sunday , is staunchly opposed to turkey joining the 27-member bloc , arguing that most of turkey 's territory is in asia .
however rehn , speaking after talks with turkey 's top eu negotiator ali babacan , said that the european union hoped to open talks with ankara , before the end of june , on three of the 35 policy chapters which must be successfully negotiated prior to membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn " i confirmed ... the goal to open three chapters still under the german -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency , " he told reporters .
portugal will assume the presidency from germany on july 1 .
this marks a major step for turkey 's eu bid as so far it has only opened two chapters , and successfully closed just one .
resumption of talks rehn stressed that the decision in march to resume the membership talks , parts of which were frozen because of turkey 's trade dispute with cyprus , was taken unanimously .
" if one or several members states want to change that negotiating mandate , then it is up to them to take the initiative and also take the responsibility of possible consequences , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy has come out strongly against turkish eu membership he congratulated sarkozy on his election win and added that it was not his task to speculate on whether the election result " is good or bad . "
" i trust that france will stick to its commitments undertaken in the course of the eu accession process , " he added .
the eu opened in march the chapter on " enterprise and industry policy " .
however no more chapters can be closed until turkey drops its long-running trade restrictions against eu member cyprus .
" in my view the best was for the eu to work with turkey in this sensitive and difficult time is by sticking to our commitment , by being firm and fair , " said rehn .
watching the political events european officials are closely watching political events in turkey , amid a crisis over the retention of a secular administration in the largely muslim nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are wary of letting turkey into the bloc turkish lawmakers on monday approved sweeping constitutional reforms that would see the president elected by popular vote , as they sought to resolve the crisis .
on sunday , parliament failed for a second time to elect a president , with an opposition boycott preventing it reaching the required quorum for a vote .
the failure prompted foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist who was the sole candidate , to withdraw his name .
the prospect of gul as president had triggered mass secular protests and a tense stand-off between the islamist-rooted government and the army , which threatened to intervene to protect secularism .
rehn said that a decision on whether turkey should be allowed to join the eu should only be made " closer to completion of the negotiation process , because only then can we see if turkey is able to meet all the legal , democratic and economic criteria . "
a european commission spokeswoman said the three new accession chapters concerned were on economic and monetary affairs , statistics and financial control . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and erdogan reconcile after turkish eu criticism german chancellor angela merkel met turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan in hanover and made their peace after the turkish leader made critical comments about german efforts in regard to turkey 's eu accession .
-lrb- 16.04.2007 -rrb- eu split over imposing tougher entry conditions on turkey european union leaders have divergent views on turkey 's troubled bid to join the 25-nation bloc , with germany and france set to call for tougher conditions on ankara .

however rehn , speaking after talks with turkey 's top eu negotiator ali babacan , said that the european union hoped to open talks with ankara , before the end of june , on three of the 35 policy chapters which must be successfully negotiated prior to membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn " i confirmed ... the goal to open three chapters still under the german -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency , " he told reporters .
portugal will assume the presidency from germany on july 1 .
this marks a major step for turkey 's eu bid as so far it has only opened two chapters , and successfully closed just one .
resumption of talks rehn stressed that the decision in march to resume the membership talks , parts of which were frozen because of turkey 's trade dispute with cyprus , was taken unanimously .
" if one or several members states want to change that negotiating mandate , then it is up to them to take the initiative and also take the responsibility of possible consequences , " he said .

" i trust that france will stick to its commitments undertaken in the course of the eu accession process , " he added .
the eu opened in march the chapter on " enterprise and industry policy " .
however no more chapters can be closed until turkey drops its long-running trade restrictions against eu member cyprus .
" in my view the best was for the eu to work with turkey in this sensitive and difficult time is by sticking to our commitment , by being firm and fair , " said rehn .
watching the political events european officials are closely watching political events in turkey , amid a crisis over the retention of a secular administration in the largely muslim nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are wary of letting turkey into the bloc turkish lawmakers on monday approved sweeping constitutional reforms that would see the president elected by popular vote , as they sought to resolve the crisis .
on sunday , parliament failed for a second time to elect a president , with an opposition boycott preventing it reaching the required quorum for a vote .
the failure prompted foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist who was the sole candidate , to withdraw his name .
the prospect of gul as president had triggered mass secular protests and a tense stand-off between the islamist-rooted government and the army , which threatened to intervene to protect secularism .
rehn said that a decision on whether turkey should be allowed to join the eu should only be made " closer to completion of the negotiation process , because only then can we see if turkey is able to meet all the legal , democratic and economic criteria . "

earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .
the news magazine focus reported that steinbrück was facing increased demands from the big spending ministries , amounting to seven billion euros in 2008 and a total of 28 billion by 2011 .

he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .

finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .

earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .

an advocate of free speech and muslim dialogue , he 's now founded a new party against right-wingers . denmark 's new party , ny alliance -lrb- new alliance -rrb- , has been stirring up the country 's political landscape .
earlier this week , the party officially broke away from the social-liberal party det radikale venstre under the leadership of syrian-born parliamentarian naser khader . " we feel politically homeless and believe that there are many others who feel the same way , " said khader . khader has gained in popularity since a danish newspaper caused an international uproar by publishing caricatures of mohammed in september 2005 .
he founded the association of democratic muslims and advocated dialogue among muslims themselves .
he also appealed to the danish people to differentiate between radical muslims and those with democratic ideals . for some observers , the time seems ripe for a shift toward the left .
according to german denmark expert bernd henningsen , ny alliance has the potential to " bring the country to its senses . " nationalist tendencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper caused an uproar in the muslim world over the past few months , members of the nationalistic dansk folkeparti -lrb- danish people 's party -rrb- have provoked the public with numerous statements against foreigners .
one member of the country 's third strongest party called homosexuality a " sickness . " another parliamentarian found resonance among fellow politicians when he compared the muslim headscarf to the nazi swastika . according to official statements , ny alliance members left the folkeparti in protest of its national rhetoric . if you ca n't beat them … det radikale venstre , which is more center-left on the political spectrum than the name suggests , is no less vocal against the far right than the khader 's group .
what differentiates the newbies , however , is not their stance but their strategy : while det radikale venstre boycotts the government , new alliance wants to join it . members of the new party have offered to partner up in a liberal-conservative coalition under prime minster anders fogh rasmussen of the liberal party after the 2009 national elections .
this would mean sending home the right-wing dansk folkeparti , which the ruling liberal-conservative coalition is dependent on for support . margrethe vestager , vice chairwoman of det radikale venstre , said she regrets khader 's decision to break away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ny alliance wants to build a coalition with current pm rasmussen " we are not interested in a coalition under anders fogh rasmussen , " said vestager .
" his cooperation with the dansk folkeparti and his position on tax policy are not acceptable to us . " support from conservatives in part due to its aim of forming a government coalition , ny alliance can count on support from the conservative camp .
one of the most prominent examples is eu parliamentarian gitte seeberg , who left the konservative folkeparti -lrb- conservative people 's party -rrb- to co-found ny alliance . seeberg said that cooperation with the dansk folkeparti on issues like immigration , the european union and globalization had become nearly impossible . ny alliance , on the other hand , aims for " 100 percent membership in the eu " and stands for a " strict but humanitarian immigration policy , " she added . denmark has one of the tightest asylum policies in europe .
last year , the council of europe criticized the scandinavian country for maintaining " an atmosphere of intolerance and xenophobia . " just a few days after its founding , ny alliance claims to have some 10,500 members already , which would put it on equal ground with its political opponents .

an advocate of free speech and muslim dialogue , he 's now founded a new party against right-wingers . denmark 's new party , ny alliance -lrb- new alliance -rrb- , has been stirring up the country 's political landscape .
earlier this week , the party officially broke away from the social-liberal party det radikale venstre under the leadership of syrian-born parliamentarian naser khader . " we feel politically homeless and believe that there are many others who feel the same way , " said khader . khader has gained in popularity since a danish newspaper caused an international uproar by publishing caricatures of mohammed in september 2005 .
he founded the association of democratic muslims and advocated dialogue among muslims themselves .
he also appealed to the danish people to differentiate between radical muslims and those with democratic ideals . for some observers , the time seems ripe for a shift toward the left .
according to german denmark expert bernd henningsen , ny alliance has the potential to " bring the country to its senses . " nationalist tendencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper caused an uproar in the muslim world over the past few months , members of the nationalistic dansk folkeparti -lrb- danish people 's party -rrb- have provoked the public with numerous statements against foreigners .
one member of the country 's third strongest party called homosexuality a " sickness . " another parliamentarian found resonance among fellow politicians when he compared the muslim headscarf to the nazi swastika . according to official statements , ny alliance members left the folkeparti in protest of its national rhetoric . if you ca n't beat them … det radikale venstre , which is more center-left on the political spectrum than the name suggests , is no less vocal against the far right than the khader 's group .
what differentiates the newbies , however , is not their stance but their strategy : while det radikale venstre boycotts the government , new alliance wants to join it . members of the new party have offered to partner up in a liberal-conservative coalition under prime minster anders fogh rasmussen of the liberal party after the 2009 national elections .
this would mean sending home the right-wing dansk folkeparti , which the ruling liberal-conservative coalition is dependent on for support . margrethe vestager , vice chairwoman of det radikale venstre , said she regrets khader 's decision to break away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ny alliance wants to build a coalition with current pm rasmussen " we are not interested in a coalition under anders fogh rasmussen , " said vestager .
" his cooperation with the dansk folkeparti and his position on tax policy are not acceptable to us . " support from conservatives in part due to its aim of forming a government coalition , ny alliance can count on support from the conservative camp .
one of the most prominent examples is eu parliamentarian gitte seeberg , who left the konservative folkeparti -lrb- conservative people 's party -rrb- to co-found ny alliance . seeberg said that cooperation with the dansk folkeparti on issues like immigration , the european union and globalization had become nearly impossible . ny alliance , on the other hand , aims for " 100 percent membership in the eu " and stands for a " strict but humanitarian immigration policy , " she added . denmark has one of the tightest asylum policies in europe .
last year , the council of europe criticized the scandinavian country for maintaining " an atmosphere of intolerance and xenophobia . " just a few days after its founding , ny alliance claims to have some 10,500 members already , which would put it on equal ground with its political opponents .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .

but they have one thing in common : they want to limit the power of corporations and make sure people have a greater say . maria mies was in seattle in 1999 as ten thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets chanting the slogans " no globalization without participation " and " the world is not for sale . " trade unions , church groups , environmentalists , women 's movements and third world groups protested against a new round of liberalization of world trade .
a retired sociology professor and member of the organization attac , which is critical of globalization , mies said she was aware of the many faces of the anti-globalization movement . " there were also poor people , farmers and -lrb- blue-collar -rrb- workers who took part spontaneously , " she said .
" there were indeed different groups , but they all were fed up and knew what they did n't want anymore . " the movement considers the promise that globalization will bring the world peace , equality , freedom and prosperity to be a lie .
they believe that poor countries in particular suffer from corporations ' pursuit of growth and are forced into poverty and dependency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working conditions in the mines of multinationals in africa are often poor opponents of globalization say companies scale down social achievements , such as minimum wages and occupational health and safety , using the argument that they must remain internationally competitive .
opposition groups demand guarantees for people 's right to self-determination and for minimum of social standards and want to change international trade agreements to favor developing countries .
more say for the people mies said democracy is globalization 's first victim , adding that the movement 's central demand for people to become more involved in political decisions has remain unchanged .
" that 's no longer possible in a globalized world controlled by multinational corporations , " said mies .
" national laws can not simply be tossed aside when a few companies lobby brussels . " political scientist claus leggewie said those opposed to globalization could be divided into five groups .

" the chancellor this afternoon called prime minister kostunica and informed him personally of her concern , " ulrich wilhelm said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel hopes that serbia will manage to form a democratic government " she furthermore urged him to use the narrow timeframe still available for forming a democratic government in order to keep serbia 's european prospects alive , " he added .
wilhelm was referring to a looming deadline for serbia 's political parties to form a government following legislative elections in january or face a new vote .
under the balkan state 's constitution , they have until may 14 .
serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic has set a friday deadline for parties that voted in an ultra-nationalist as parliament speaker to show if they have a majority for forming a coalition government .
a powerful post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's ultranationalist radical party leader tomislav nikolic tomislav nikolic , the leader of the serbian radical party which won most votes in the jan .
21 elections , was voted in as parliamentary speaker on tuesday with the support of kostunica 's moderate nationalists .
it is one of the three most powerful posts in the country and observers say nikolic 's election deepens the political paralysis that has beset serbia .
squabbling moderate parties have so far failed to form a coalition , despite fears that new elections could see the extreme nationalists increase their share of the vote .
the radical party was an on-off ally of late authoritarian serbian leader slobodan milosevic 's socialists throughout the balkan wars up until his arrest in 2001 and removal to the un international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
a sensitive moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav kostunica 's moderately nationalist party helped elect nikolic nikolic 's election was also criticized by the council of europe just as belgrade was due to assume on friday the rotating chairmanship of the council 's committee of ministers which groups the 46 member states ' foreign ministers and representatives .
rene van der linden , president of the council 's parliamentary assembly , said that the election of nikolic was " a burden on serbia 's ability to carry out its task " as chairman of the committee .
" the parliamentary assembly 's values are totally opposed to those of mr. nikolic 's party .
given the gravity of this issue , the parliamentary assembly will continue to follow developments closely , " he said .
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president boris tadic set friday as a deadline for the formation of a new government the european union froze rapprochement talks with belgrade a year ago , mainly because of belgrade 's failure to hand former bosnian serb army chief ratko mladic over to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia .
nikolic 's election , however , comes as serbia battles the prospect of its province of kosovo being awarded independence by the un security council , an issue the radicals have campaigned hard against .
it was an argument over key security posts that handle the kosovo issue and relations with the un tribunal that led to the break up of coalition talks between the parties of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , kostunica and the reformist g17 plus . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united nations envoy says kosovo must stick to his plan the un special envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said he saw no alternative to his proposal for supervised independence for serbian breakaway province kosovo .

" there were also poor people , farmers and -lrb- blue-collar -rrb- workers who took part spontaneously , " she said .
" there were indeed different groups , but they all were fed up and knew what they did n't want anymore . " the movement considers the promise that globalization will bring the world peace , equality , freedom and prosperity to be a lie .

but they have one thing in common : they want to limit the power of corporations and make sure people have a greater say . maria mies was in seattle in 1999 as ten thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets chanting the slogans " no globalization without participation " and " the world is not for sale . " trade unions , church groups , environmentalists , women 's movements and third world groups protested against a new round of liberalization of world trade .
a retired sociology professor and member of the organization attac , which is critical of globalization , mies said she was aware of the many faces of the anti-globalization movement . " there were also poor people , farmers and -lrb- blue-collar -rrb- workers who took part spontaneously , " she said .
" there were indeed different groups , but they all were fed up and knew what they did n't want anymore . " the movement considers the promise that globalization will bring the world peace , equality , freedom and prosperity to be a lie .
they believe that poor countries in particular suffer from corporations ' pursuit of growth and are forced into poverty and dependency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working conditions in the mines of multinationals in africa are often poor opponents of globalization say companies scale down social achievements , such as minimum wages and occupational health and safety , using the argument that they must remain internationally competitive .
opposition groups demand guarantees for people 's right to self-determination and for minimum of social standards and want to change international trade agreements to favor developing countries .
more say for the people mies said democracy is globalization 's first victim , adding that the movement 's central demand for people to become more involved in political decisions has remain unchanged .
" that 's no longer possible in a globalized world controlled by multinational corporations , " said mies .
" national laws can not simply be tossed aside when a few companies lobby brussels . " political scientist claus leggewie said those opposed to globalization could be divided into five groups .
in his book " die globalisierung und ihre gegner " -lrb- globalization and its critics -rrb- , he separated the groups into five subsets : leftists and radical leftists are interested in social justice and want to develop a different societal system ; the academic left has taken up some ideas from the ecological movement and engages in a certain amount of marxist criticism ; reformers from the business world favor employing a social democratic approach to tame capitalism ; globalization critics grounded in religion link to the churches ' traditions of social reform ; and right-wing opponents to globalization put the stress on the nation state heterogeneity has advantages in addition to large organizations , such as attac , greenpeace , trade unions and churches , innumerable smaller local and regional groups are also part of the struggle , but the varying currents united by one movement is n't problematic , according to leggewie . " a movement is characterized precisely by a high level of heterogeneity and loose connections , " he said , adding that it allows the movement to distribute various tasks .
the groups aiming for reform had their target audiences just as the radical and militant groups that organize protests did . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent protesters are a minority among the critics of globalization churches made opponents of globalization capable of action by providing financing , infrastructure and organizational skills needed by a movement low on resources before trade unions or political parties get involved , leggewie said . despite their different perspectives , the groups must see their work as being interrelated , according to mies .
no progress could be made if economic factors are viewed as being unconnected to the environment issues , she said . leggewie , however , said the movement could already chalk up a huge success .
" worldwide , there 's no one anymore who pursues globalization as it was in the 1990s , " he said .
" all of the criticism that is warranted is mainstream today - such as criticism of the ecological consequences of unfettered globalization .

however rehn , speaking after talks with turkey 's top eu negotiator ali babacan , said that the european union hoped to open talks with ankara , before the end of june , on three of the 35 policy chapters which must be successfully negotiated prior to membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn " i confirmed ... the goal to open three chapters still under the german -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency , " he told reporters .
portugal will assume the presidency from germany on july 1 .
this marks a major step for turkey 's eu bid as so far it has only opened two chapters , and successfully closed just one .
resumption of talks rehn stressed that the decision in march to resume the membership talks , parts of which were frozen because of turkey 's trade dispute with cyprus , was taken unanimously .
" if one or several members states want to change that negotiating mandate , then it is up to them to take the initiative and also take the responsibility of possible consequences , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy has come out strongly against turkish eu membership he congratulated sarkozy on his election win and added that it was not his task to speculate on whether the election result " is good or bad . "
" i trust that france will stick to its commitments undertaken in the course of the eu accession process , " he added .
the eu opened in march the chapter on " enterprise and industry policy " .
however no more chapters can be closed until turkey drops its long-running trade restrictions against eu member cyprus .
" in my view the best was for the eu to work with turkey in this sensitive and difficult time is by sticking to our commitment , by being firm and fair , " said rehn .
watching the political events european officials are closely watching political events in turkey , amid a crisis over the retention of a secular administration in the largely muslim nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are wary of letting turkey into the bloc turkish lawmakers on monday approved sweeping constitutional reforms that would see the president elected by popular vote , as they sought to resolve the crisis .
on sunday , parliament failed for a second time to elect a president , with an opposition boycott preventing it reaching the required quorum for a vote .
the failure prompted foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist who was the sole candidate , to withdraw his name .
the prospect of gul as president had triggered mass secular protests and a tense stand-off between the islamist-rooted government and the army , which threatened to intervene to protect secularism .
rehn said that a decision on whether turkey should be allowed to join the eu should only be made " closer to completion of the negotiation process , because only then can we see if turkey is able to meet all the legal , democratic and economic criteria . "

however rehn , speaking after talks with turkey 's top eu negotiator ali babacan , said that the european union hoped to open talks with ankara , before the end of june , on three of the 35 policy chapters which must be successfully negotiated prior to membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn " i confirmed ... the goal to open three chapters still under the german -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency , " he told reporters .
portugal will assume the presidency from germany on july 1 .
this marks a major step for turkey 's eu bid as so far it has only opened two chapters , and successfully closed just one .
resumption of talks rehn stressed that the decision in march to resume the membership talks , parts of which were frozen because of turkey 's trade dispute with cyprus , was taken unanimously .
" if one or several members states want to change that negotiating mandate , then it is up to them to take the initiative and also take the responsibility of possible consequences , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy has come out strongly against turkish eu membership he congratulated sarkozy on his election win and added that it was not his task to speculate on whether the election result " is good or bad . "
" i trust that france will stick to its commitments undertaken in the course of the eu accession process , " he added .
the eu opened in march the chapter on " enterprise and industry policy " .
however no more chapters can be closed until turkey drops its long-running trade restrictions against eu member cyprus .
" in my view the best was for the eu to work with turkey in this sensitive and difficult time is by sticking to our commitment , by being firm and fair , " said rehn .
watching the political events european officials are closely watching political events in turkey , amid a crisis over the retention of a secular administration in the largely muslim nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are wary of letting turkey into the bloc turkish lawmakers on monday approved sweeping constitutional reforms that would see the president elected by popular vote , as they sought to resolve the crisis .
on sunday , parliament failed for a second time to elect a president , with an opposition boycott preventing it reaching the required quorum for a vote .
the failure prompted foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist who was the sole candidate , to withdraw his name .
the prospect of gul as president had triggered mass secular protests and a tense stand-off between the islamist-rooted government and the army , which threatened to intervene to protect secularism .
rehn said that a decision on whether turkey should be allowed to join the eu should only be made " closer to completion of the negotiation process , because only then can we see if turkey is able to meet all the legal , democratic and economic criteria . "

earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .
the news magazine focus reported that steinbrück was facing increased demands from the big spending ministries , amounting to seven billion euros in 2008 and a total of 28 billion by 2011 .

earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .

" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .
the news magazine focus reported that steinbrück was facing increased demands from the big spending ministries , amounting to seven billion euros in 2008 and a total of 28 billion by 2011 .
focus cited a list from the finance ministry it had seen . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says german deficit sinking fast the european commission said germany 's efforts to clean up its financial house are paying off , with the country expected to pare its budget deficit down to three percent of gross domestic product in 2008 .

an advocate of free speech and muslim dialogue , he 's now founded a new party against right-wingers . denmark 's new party , ny alliance -lrb- new alliance -rrb- , has been stirring up the country 's political landscape .
earlier this week , the party officially broke away from the social-liberal party det radikale venstre under the leadership of syrian-born parliamentarian naser khader . " we feel politically homeless and believe that there are many others who feel the same way , " said khader . khader has gained in popularity since a danish newspaper caused an international uproar by publishing caricatures of mohammed in september 2005 .
he founded the association of democratic muslims and advocated dialogue among muslims themselves .
he also appealed to the danish people to differentiate between radical muslims and those with democratic ideals . for some observers , the time seems ripe for a shift toward the left .
according to german denmark expert bernd henningsen , ny alliance has the potential to " bring the country to its senses .

an advocate of free speech and muslim dialogue , he 's now founded a new party against right-wingers . denmark 's new party , ny alliance -lrb- new alliance -rrb- , has been stirring up the country 's political landscape .
earlier this week , the party officially broke away from the social-liberal party det radikale venstre under the leadership of syrian-born parliamentarian naser khader . " we feel politically homeless and believe that there are many others who feel the same way , " said khader . khader has gained in popularity since a danish newspaper caused an international uproar by publishing caricatures of mohammed in september 2005 .
he founded the association of democratic muslims and advocated dialogue among muslims themselves .
he also appealed to the danish people to differentiate between radical muslims and those with democratic ideals . for some observers , the time seems ripe for a shift toward the left .
according to german denmark expert bernd henningsen , ny alliance has the potential to " bring the country to its senses . " nationalist tendencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper caused an uproar in the muslim world over the past few months , members of the nationalistic dansk folkeparti -lrb- danish people 's party -rrb- have provoked the public with numerous statements against foreigners .
one member of the country 's third strongest party called homosexuality a " sickness . " another parliamentarian found resonance among fellow politicians when he compared the muslim headscarf to the nazi swastika . according to official statements , ny alliance members left the folkeparti in protest of its national rhetoric . if you ca n't beat them … det radikale venstre , which is more center-left on the political spectrum than the name suggests , is no less vocal against the far right than the khader 's group .
what differentiates the newbies , however , is not their stance but their strategy : while det radikale venstre boycotts the government , new alliance wants to join it . members of the new party have offered to partner up in a liberal-conservative coalition under prime minster anders fogh rasmussen of the liberal party after the 2009 national elections .
this would mean sending home the right-wing dansk folkeparti , which the ruling liberal-conservative coalition is dependent on for support . margrethe vestager , vice chairwoman of det radikale venstre , said she regrets khader 's decision to break away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ny alliance wants to build a coalition with current pm rasmussen " we are not interested in a coalition under anders fogh rasmussen , " said vestager .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

when michael ballack signed for english champions chelsea last may , he was expected to put the finishing touches to a squad of world-beaters .
by april 2007 , ballack was in the dock and chelsea 's season in tatters . it all began with great expectations and ended in a blaze of recriminations and showdown talks .
michael ballack 's first season in london with chelsea came to a premature halt last month at a stage when the premiership , champions league and fa cup were all still up for grabs .
the germany captain chose to have an unauthorized ankle operation in late april at a time when the season reached its climax and was absent as chelsea crashed out of the european cup and lost their league title to manchester united all in the space of a week .
ballack 's transfer was supposed to be one of the last great pieces needed to complete chelsea 's world domination jigsaw puzzle .
but the signature of the former bayern munich midfielder , along with the other high-profile summer signing of ukrainian andriy shevchenko , was this week being implicated in the collapse of the london club 's season .
analysts and critics pinpointed the inability of chelsea 's newest galacticos to fit in with an already awesomely successful system and tight-knit family of players as one of the main reasons why jose mourinho 's team failed to capture the most significant silverware on offer .
but was ballack 's first season in england really such a disaster ?
compared to the shocking form of shevchenko , it could be said that the german was a resounding success .
considering it was his first season in a new country , one whose press had condemned him as an expensive flop before a ball was even kicked , ballack soon became a mainstay of a team that will finish second in the league , reached the champions league semi-finals and the fa cup final and won the league cup .
his coach even referred to him as one of chelsea 's " untouchables " – that is before ballack decided to have medical treatment without mourinho 's permission .
ankle injury puts future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's future at stamford bridge is in doubt as mourinho is not thought to have directly sanctioned the micro-surgery the germany captain had , but ballack is determined to stay at the club and has blamed the club 's medical department for the dispute . it is understood ballack has claimed chelsea 's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at newcastle last month .
he traveled to germany to consult national team doctor dr hans muller wohlfahrt who recommended immediate action . a statement from the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- supported the decision : " an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable .
wohlfahrt detected lose splints in ballack 's left high ankle .
any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player 's health , even threatened ballack 's career . "
now , with ballack locked in talks with the chelsea hierarchy over his future at the club , it seems that an autopsy of the dethroned champions ' season will also include a report on the germany captain 's contribution to it .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer protection minister horst seehofer wants germans to eat healthy with a five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " the government agreed on wednesday to promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to their nutritional needs .
" this is really simply about what 's the right way to eat , " said germany 's minister for food , agriculture and consumer protection , horst seehofer .
according to government statistics , around 37 million adults and around two million children in germany are overweight .
one fourth of adult germans suffer from cardiovascular diseases , while there are around four million diabetics in the country .
one in five german women and one in seven men have chronic back pain .
the annual costs of treating nutrition-related illnesses amount to 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 95.3 billion -rrb- , which is 30 percent of germany 's overall health costs .
a plan to shape up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health minister ulla schmidt stresses the importance of nutritional education health minister ulla schmidt said that many germans know what constitutes a healthy lifestyle , but are not necessarily actively pursuing it .
" that 's why we need a plan that would involve everybody , " schmidt said .
the government 's obesity prevention strategy calls on politicians , scientists , sports clubs , health-care providers , unions and the food industry to join in the battle to get germans to shape up .
according to the plan , nutritional information should be more readily available on all kinds of food products .
kindergartens , schools , universities and hospitals should also pay more attention to the kinds of food they serve in their cafeterias .
the ultimate goal of the strategy is to improve public health and stop the increasing obesity rates among children by 2020 .
fattest europeans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but they look so appetizing !
the new initiative was spurred by a study released by the international association for the study of obesity .
it found that among eu countries , germany has the most overweight women and men .
among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight ; 75.4 percent of men tip the scales .
running a close second among women was the uk , where 58.5 percent of women are overweight .
among men , the czech republic came in second .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teenagers could not imagine a life without cell phones there is probably no easier way to upset a group of sleep-deprived adults on their way to work than to subject them to the ambient sounds of burping crocodiles or robotic squeaks of mexican folk bands singing " la cucaracha " after sniffing helium .
and it 's not as if one can escape the manic world of cell phones .
they are literally everywhere - in restaurants , parks , public transportation and movie theaters .
surely , mobile phones are a means of communication and a symbol of the information overload that characterizes our society .
but they are also much more than that : a tool of self-fashioning and personal expression , according to the fashion mantra of the 21st century : let me hear your cell phone ring and i will tell you what kind of person you are .
it 's not all that bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if beethoven could only hear that even birds know his ode to joy !
cell phones can , however , be used for goals more inspiring than driving your fellow subway-passengers up the wall .
william engelen , for instance , a dutch artist living in germany , may revolutionize the way we think about cell phones .
engelen asked the residents of bonn to download a digital version of the " ode to joy " from beethoven 's " 9th symphony " and use it as their mobile ring tone .
his idea is that if enough cell phone users play the same musical melody every time their mobile rings , male blackbirds will begin to imitate the sound .
that blackbirds have an artistic streak in them has been well-documented by biologists observing their behavior .
male blackbirds are big fans of singing competitions .
in the mother nature 's very own , original version of " avian idol " - later appropriated by humans and turned into an international money-making machine known as " american idol " or " german superstar " - they get to exercise their vocal chords and fight for the prestigious title of the loudest bird on the block .
chicks apparently love it .
that 's why some urban blackbirds can begin to sound like sirens , honking cars or even popular song refrains .
sing it back !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's , like , all of a sudden , everybody has the same ring tone with bonn being the city of birth of ludwig van beethoven , engelen chose to teach birds to chirp the great composer .
the entire project is sponsored by the beethoven foundation and has received quite a bit of publicity locally as a curious artistic intervention in the animal world .
engelen says if it works , he 'll take the project to other cities .
if all goes as planned , the bonn blackbirds will be able to form a chorus of their own and tour the rest of the country .
this is likely to raise the profile of classical music among birds in general and may even push beethoven to the top of avian pop charts .

the software will identify the paper color , typefaces , any rubber stamps and the outlines of the tears .
just like a jigsaw solver , as soon as it discovers edges that match , it will link up the images .
" it 's very exciting to decode stasi papers , " schneider said .
" you have the feeling you are making history . "
the job was made easier by the way the stasi officers had manually torn up the papers after their office shredders had broken down .
when a table would get filled with torn pieces , they were all shoved into one bag before the next lot was torn .
as a result , each sack contains almost a complete set of papers , with practically no mixing of documents between the bags .
before the collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany was a police state as communism collapsed in 1989 , the ministry for state security burned and shredded files and tore others up by hand .
the burning and shredding can not be undone , but the new authorities retrieved the scraps that were semi-intact and only jumbled .
berlin vowed to put the scraps , which are mostly postcard sized , back into the correct order to be read .
the job fell to 15 workers sitting in an office near nürnberg who have managed to work through 323 sacks since 1995 .
with nearly 16,000 more sacks to go , it would take over 400 years to complete the job manually .
in 2003 , the government said it could not afford 50 million euros to computerize the task , so legislators have approved a more modest pilot project .

the software will identify the paper color , typefaces , any rubber stamps and the outlines of the tears .
just like a jigsaw solver , as soon as it discovers edges that match , it will link up the images .
" it 's very exciting to decode stasi papers , " schneider said .
" you have the feeling you are making history . "
the job was made easier by the way the stasi officers had manually torn up the papers after their office shredders had broken down .

berlin vowed to put the scraps , which are mostly postcard sized , back into the correct order to be read .
the job fell to 15 workers sitting in an office near nürnberg who have managed to work through 323 sacks since 1995 .
with nearly 16,000 more sacks to go , it would take over 400 years to complete the job manually .

the software will identify the paper color , typefaces , any rubber stamps and the outlines of the tears .
just like a jigsaw solver , as soon as it discovers edges that match , it will link up the images .
" it 's very exciting to decode stasi papers , " schneider said .
" you have the feeling you are making history . "
the job was made easier by the way the stasi officers had manually torn up the papers after their office shredders had broken down .
when a table would get filled with torn pieces , they were all shoved into one bag before the next lot was torn .
as a result , each sack contains almost a complete set of papers , with practically no mixing of documents between the bags .
before the collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany was a police state as communism collapsed in 1989 , the ministry for state security burned and shredded files and tore others up by hand .
the burning and shredding can not be undone , but the new authorities retrieved the scraps that were semi-intact and only jumbled .
berlin vowed to put the scraps , which are mostly postcard sized , back into the correct order to be read .
the job fell to 15 workers sitting in an office near nürnberg who have managed to work through 323 sacks since 1995 .
with nearly 16,000 more sacks to go , it would take over 400 years to complete the job manually .
in 2003 , the government said it could not afford 50 million euros to computerize the task , so legislators have approved a more modest pilot project .
each scrap will be scanned and a computer will try to match images by shape , jigsaw style , to others from the same sack .
germany has already opened many undamaged stasi files to historians and to former stasi victims , helping them to identify informers in a society that was ruled by the fear of denunciation , but there are big gaps in the archives .
staff working for the custodian of the files , former east german democracy activist marianne birthler , say the funding means 400 more sacks can be processed in the next two years , more than the number reconstituted so far by human intelligence .
new insights expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi archives were already used to expose former spies birthler aide günter bormann said the bags to be scanned and re- assembled appeared to contain files in active use in 1988 and 1989 as the communist system teetered on the brink of collapse .
none are thought to relate to east german espionage abroad : that department 's files were almost completely destroyed .
it is not clear yet what will happen after the pilot project is completed .
undamaged stasi files have already helped to expose many of the turncoats who tried to bury their past when communism fell .
former stasi officers are barred as security risks from many german public offices .
a legislator , klaus-peter willsch , said the documents might help undercover more stasi informers so they can be punished .
he believes all 16,000 sacks could be reconstructed for less than 30 million euros -lrb- 40 million dollars -rrb- . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new exhibition looks at daily life in east germany a new exhibition on east germany has just opened in berlin 's german historical museum .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teenagers could not imagine a life without cell phones there is probably no easier way to upset a group of sleep-deprived adults on their way to work than to subject them to the ambient sounds of burping crocodiles or robotic squeaks of mexican folk bands singing " la cucaracha " after sniffing helium .
and it 's not as if one can escape the manic world of cell phones .
they are literally everywhere - in restaurants , parks , public transportation and movie theaters .
surely , mobile phones are a means of communication and a symbol of the information overload that characterizes our society .
but they are also much more than that : a tool of self-fashioning and personal expression , according to the fashion mantra of the 21st century : let me hear your cell phone ring and i will tell you what kind of person you are .
it 's not all that bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if beethoven could only hear that even birds know his ode to joy !
cell phones can , however , be used for goals more inspiring than driving your fellow subway-passengers up the wall .
william engelen , for instance , a dutch artist living in germany , may revolutionize the way we think about cell phones .
engelen asked the residents of bonn to download a digital version of the " ode to joy " from beethoven 's " 9th symphony " and use it as their mobile ring tone .
his idea is that if enough cell phone users play the same musical melody every time their mobile rings , male blackbirds will begin to imitate the sound .
that blackbirds have an artistic streak in them has been well-documented by biologists observing their behavior .
male blackbirds are big fans of singing competitions .
in the mother nature 's very own , original version of " avian idol " - later appropriated by humans and turned into an international money-making machine known as " american idol " or " german superstar " - they get to exercise their vocal chords and fight for the prestigious title of the loudest bird on the block .
chicks apparently love it .
that 's why some urban blackbirds can begin to sound like sirens , honking cars or even popular song refrains .
sing it back !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's , like , all of a sudden , everybody has the same ring tone with bonn being the city of birth of ludwig van beethoven , engelen chose to teach birds to chirp the great composer .
the entire project is sponsored by the beethoven foundation and has received quite a bit of publicity locally as a curious artistic intervention in the animal world .
engelen says if it works , he 'll take the project to other cities .
if all goes as planned , the bonn blackbirds will be able to form a chorus of their own and tour the rest of the country .
this is likely to raise the profile of classical music among birds in general and may even push beethoven to the top of avian pop charts .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer protection minister horst seehofer wants germans to eat healthy with a five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " the government agreed on wednesday to promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to their nutritional needs .
" this is really simply about what 's the right way to eat , " said germany 's minister for food , agriculture and consumer protection , horst seehofer .
according to government statistics , around 37 million adults and around two million children in germany are overweight .
one fourth of adult germans suffer from cardiovascular diseases , while there are around four million diabetics in the country .
one in five german women and one in seven men have chronic back pain .
the annual costs of treating nutrition-related illnesses amount to 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 95.3 billion -rrb- , which is 30 percent of germany 's overall health costs .
a plan to shape up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health minister ulla schmidt stresses the importance of nutritional education health minister ulla schmidt said that many germans know what constitutes a healthy lifestyle , but are not necessarily actively pursuing it .
" that 's why we need a plan that would involve everybody , " schmidt said .
the government 's obesity prevention strategy calls on politicians , scientists , sports clubs , health-care providers , unions and the food industry to join in the battle to get germans to shape up .
according to the plan , nutritional information should be more readily available on all kinds of food products .
kindergartens , schools , universities and hospitals should also pay more attention to the kinds of food they serve in their cafeterias .
the ultimate goal of the strategy is to improve public health and stop the increasing obesity rates among children by 2020 .

among adults , the study found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight ; 75.4 percent of men tip the scales .
running a close second among women was the uk , where 58.5 percent of women are overweight .
among men , the czech republic came in second .

earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .
the news magazine focus reported that steinbrück was facing increased demands from the big spending ministries , amounting to seven billion euros in 2008 and a total of 28 billion by 2011 .

some of the world 's most promising young violin makers go to mittenwald , nestled in the lush foothills at the southernmost tip of bavaria , to learn the secrets of fashioning the musician 's greatest asset - the instrument itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school is housed in a historical building from 1893 mittenwald , now a village with around 8,000 residents , has a long tradition of musical handcrafts .
the great violin maker matthias klotz -lrb- 1653-1743 -rrb- began practicing his trade there in the late 17th century , bringing prosperity and esteem to the region .
visitors to mittenwald will find a statue on the town 's market square commemorating the renowned instrument builder .
hanging on to tradition in the 19th century , competition between violin makers became increasingly tough due to the use of new mass production methods .
to preserve the tradition and art of entirely handmade instruments , bavarian elector maximilian i commissioned a school for young violin makers in 1858 .
the mittenwald school for violin making , located in the same building since 1893 , still trains the next generation of artisans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students complete seven instruments in as many semesters of study at any given time , between 80 and 100 protégés attend the school , which offers a particularly rigorous seven-semester curriculum that includes each step of the building process .
around 40 students study violin building , while the others learn to make plucked string instruments -lrb- like guitars and mandolins -rrb- , bows , wind instruments or brass instruments .
all of the school 's graduates find jobs in their chosen trade , said a school representative .
many open private instrument-making studios , while others may choose to work in museums , restoring old instruments .
visitors can learn more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violin makers must be able to play their creations , too though tours of the school and the workshops are n't officially offered , the school said it would gladly show around student groups , musicians and even tourists who call ahead of time .
for those interested in more detailed information about violin making and the history of the craft in the mittenwald region , the village offers a museum with exhibits on the building process , matthias klotz and the significance of violin making in mittenwald over the past few centuries .
mittenwald 's museum of violin making is open tuesday through saturday from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm in the peak season , and 11:00 am to 4:00 pm in the off season . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : berlin philharmonic celebrates 125th anniversary a may day concert in berlin conducted by sir simon rattle marked the 125th anniversary of the founding of one of the world 's top orchestras , the berlin philharmonic .

" we suspect those targeted , who belong to the militant extreme-left scene , of founding a terrorist organisation or being members of such an organisation , that is planning arson attacks and other actions to severely disrupt or prevent the early-summer g8 summit in heiligendamm from taking place , " the prosecutor 's office said .
the summit which opens on june 6 on germany 's baltic coast will see german chancellor angeal merkel hosting the leaders of britain , canada , france , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
climate change and poverty in africa will dominate the agenda .
german politicians and security experts have issued warnings of potential violence ahead of the summit .
" we are particularly focused on dangers arising from violent globalization opponents , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
police targeted members of militant groups police suspect the left-wing militants they are targeting of being behind a string of attacks in and around hamburg and berlin .
last december , a car was set on fire in front of the home of deputy finance minister thomas mirow and the walls of his home were splattered with paint .
the hotel where the summit is to take place has also been vandalized with paint .
on wednesday , the more than 40 raids across the country included one on the leftist " rote flora " cultural center in hamburg amid concerns it was being used by a domestic left-wing radical group .
the investigation also focused on members of the radical communist organization " militante gruppe " -lrb- mg -rrb- , which has claimed 25 attacks since 2001 .
most have involved setting fire to a building or vehicle belonging to the police or other public institution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing demonstrators protest against the g8 summit in berlin on may 1 , 2007 in past letters claiming responsibility for crimes , mg has named disrupting the upcoming g8 conference as a motive .
" we 're not dealing here with some left-wing loonies who want to throw a bucket of paint , " the online version of news magazine der spiegel quoted an investigator involved in the raids as saying .
" we 're talking here about groups who have terrorism potential . "
protest from the far-left anti-globalization groups like gipfelsoli and attac have condemned the raids as " a wave of repression " and " criminalization . "
" all attempts to criminalize us do not change the fact that we will sue the g8 -lrb- summit -rrb- to cast a spotlight on the injustices of this world , " said hanne jobst from gipfelsoli in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arson and vandalism are the main crimes from militant left-wing groups germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble , however , has said that he sees a clear security threat .
he has announced has announced a tightening of border controls ahead of the summit .
that will mean that the country 's visa-free travel policy for schengen zone members would be suspended during the event , as it was during the soccer world cup last summer .
police are bracing for an expected 100,000 demonstrators to gather in the area near the summit venue , a luxury hotel in heiligendamm on the baltic coast , on june 6-8 .
tight security measures are in the works , including a 12 kilometer -lrb- 7.5 mile -rrb- long fence designed to protect diplomats attending the event .
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed in riots . demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : g8 aims to link aid , social standards in developing world labor and employment ministers from the world 's richest nations appealed to developing countries and emerging economies to improve social standards .

earlier , the minister said additional tax revenues could help to bring the deficit down to zero by 2011 . debate has heated up among german politicians about how to spend additional tax revenues german finance minister peer steinbrück is expecting over the next few years .
germany 's green party has demanded that the finance minister balance the german domestic budget by 2009 .
anja hajduk , green party expert for domestic finances , told the berliner zeitung paper that it would be " absolutely unacceptable " if steinbrück were to aim for a balanced budget without new debt in 2011 .
" people can not get anywhere if they do not set ambitious goals , " she said .
no new debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling coffers can be a tricky business she said that in the coming year , new debt should only compose a one-digit sum , so that by 2009 , a budget without new debt should be possible .
" setting 2009 as the goal makes sense since by then four years of successful economic management will have been achieved , " hajduk said .
axel weber , president of the german central bank -lrb- bundesbank -rrb- , took it one step further .
" we believe a structurally balanced domestic budget is possible by 2008 , 2009 at the latest , " weber told the mass circulation bild paper .
" we must remain on this steady course of consolidating the budget and should take advantage of the economic upswing to help to us along that path even more , " he added .
he said now is not the time for " good deed " politics involving possibly lowering taxes .
reducing spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrück jürgen koppelin , domestic budget expert for the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , agreed .
he said reducing new debt to zero would be possible in 2008 .
" the budget could be balanced by next year if people really wanted it that way , " koppelin told the berliner zeitung .
to achieve that , he said , government spending would have to be reduced .
" but rather than consolidating the budget , chancellor angela merkel prefers to spend money on good deeds , " koppelin criticized .
he said it was irresponsible of ministers in the ruling christian democratic-social democratic -lrb- cdu-spd -rrb- coalition to make new demands for spending when the budget deficit remains huge .
lowering taxes bavarian economics minister erwin huber of the conservative christian social union , the sister party to the cdu , said however , that taxes should be lowered .
" of course , budget consolidation should take first priority , but as soon as there 's some flexibility , taxes should be lowered , particularly to ease the burden on families , " huber said in bayrischer rundfunk public television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say consolidating rather than spending is smart he also said the economic upswing could be used to invest more in future-oriented areas like education , research and child care .
finance minister steinbrück had announced on the weekend that estimations by his ministry saw an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion dollars -rrb- in tax revenues flowing into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück told the weekend edition of die welt newspaper that the additional tax intake for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
a year ago , steinbrück 's ministry estimated total revenues for the federal government over four years at 877 billion euros , suggesting that the new estimate is some 10 percent higher than previously forecast .
but he warned the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of deficits in excess of european union requirements .
the news magazine focus reported that steinbrück was facing increased demands from the big spending ministries , amounting to seven billion euros in 2008 and a total of 28 billion by 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 09.05.2007 bavarian violin-making school carries on century-old tradition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violin making is a fine mix of art , handcraft and science for nearly 150 years , young artisans have headed to a tiny village in bavaria to learn the traditional art of making violins . the art of performing a bach violin suite or a beethoven sonata does n't begin in the practice room - but in the violin maker 's workshop .
some of the world 's most promising young violin makers go to mittenwald , nestled in the lush foothills at the southernmost tip of bavaria , to learn the secrets of fashioning the musician 's greatest asset - the instrument itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the school is housed in a historical building from 1893 mittenwald , now a village with around 8,000 residents , has a long tradition of musical handcrafts .
the great violin maker matthias klotz -lrb- 1653-1743 -rrb- began practicing his trade there in the late 17th century , bringing prosperity and esteem to the region .
visitors to mittenwald will find a statue on the town 's market square commemorating the renowned instrument builder .
hanging on to tradition in the 19th century , competition between violin makers became increasingly tough due to the use of new mass production methods .
to preserve the tradition and art of entirely handmade instruments , bavarian elector maximilian i commissioned a school for young violin makers in 1858 .
the mittenwald school for violin making , located in the same building since 1893 , still trains the next generation of artisans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students complete seven instruments in as many semesters of study at any given time , between 80 and 100 protégés attend the school , which offers a particularly rigorous seven-semester curriculum that includes each step of the building process .
around 40 students study violin building , while the others learn to make plucked string instruments -lrb- like guitars and mandolins -rrb- , bows , wind instruments or brass instruments .
all of the school 's graduates find jobs in their chosen trade , said a school representative .
many open private instrument-making studios , while others may choose to work in museums , restoring old instruments .
visitors can learn more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violin makers must be able to play their creations , too though tours of the school and the workshops are n't officially offered , the school said it would gladly show around student groups , musicians and even tourists who call ahead of time .
for those interested in more detailed information about violin making and the history of the craft in the mittenwald region , the village offers a museum with exhibits on the building process , matthias klotz and the significance of violin making in mittenwald over the past few centuries .
mittenwald 's museum of violin making is open tuesday through saturday from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm in the peak season , and 11:00 am to 4:00 pm in the off season . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : berlin philharmonic celebrates 125th anniversary a may day concert in berlin conducted by sir simon rattle marked the 125th anniversary of the founding of one of the world 's top orchestras , the berlin philharmonic .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teenagers could not imagine a life without cell phones there is probably no easier way to upset a group of sleep-deprived adults on their way to work than to subject them to the ambient sounds of burping crocodiles or robotic squeaks of mexican folk bands singing " la cucaracha " after sniffing helium .
and it 's not as if one can escape the manic world of cell phones .
they are literally everywhere - in restaurants , parks , public transportation and movie theaters .
surely , mobile phones are a means of communication and a symbol of the information overload that characterizes our society .
but they are also much more than that : a tool of self-fashioning and personal expression , according to the fashion mantra of the 21st century : let me hear your cell phone ring and i will tell you what kind of person you are .
it 's not all that bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if beethoven could only hear that even birds know his ode to joy !
cell phones can , however , be used for goals more inspiring than driving your fellow subway-passengers up the wall .
william engelen , for instance , a dutch artist living in germany , may revolutionize the way we think about cell phones .
engelen asked the residents of bonn to download a digital version of the " ode to joy " from beethoven 's " 9th symphony " and use it as their mobile ring tone .
his idea is that if enough cell phone users play the same musical melody every time their mobile rings , male blackbirds will begin to imitate the sound .
that blackbirds have an artistic streak in them has been well-documented by biologists observing their behavior .
male blackbirds are big fans of singing competitions .
in the mother nature 's very own , original version of " avian idol " - later appropriated by humans and turned into an international money-making machine known as " american idol " or " german superstar " - they get to exercise their vocal chords and fight for the prestigious title of the loudest bird on the block .
chicks apparently love it .
that 's why some urban blackbirds can begin to sound like sirens , honking cars or even popular song refrains .
sing it back !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's , like , all of a sudden , everybody has the same ring tone with bonn being the city of birth of ludwig van beethoven , engelen chose to teach birds to chirp the great composer .
the entire project is sponsored by the beethoven foundation and has received quite a bit of publicity locally as a curious artistic intervention in the animal world .
engelen says if it works , he 'll take the project to other cities .
if all goes as planned , the bonn blackbirds will be able to form a chorus of their own and tour the rest of the country .
this is likely to raise the profile of classical music among birds in general and may even push beethoven to the top of avian pop charts .

the judge accused the us government of " fraud , deceit , and trickery " in its handling of the case .
posada , 79 , was detained in may 2005 after entering the us illegally .
a former cia employee , he is wanted in venezuela and cuba over the downing of a cuban airliner in 1976 in which 73 people died .

" thank god , you , all of my brothers , the people in cuba ... for this victory , " he said .
cuba reacted with anger at news that he had been cleared on tuesday . "
the government 's tactics in this case are so grossly shocking and so outrageous as to violate the universal sense of justice " judge kathleen cardone " this decision is an outrage to the cuban people and to the nations that lost 73 of their sons and daughters in the heinous 1976 attack that blew up a civilian cubana de aviación aircraft off the coast of barbados , " a government statement said .
havana accused the us of applying double standards in its war on terror because posada was once employed by the cia .

a veteran anti-communist , posada was jailed in venezuela over the airliner bombing , but escaped from jail in 1985 during an appeal against his conviction .
he was then jailed in panama in 2000 for plotting the assassination of his arch-enemy cuban leader fidel castro , but was pardoned and released four years later .
us authorities are also reported to be investigating whether posada was involved in the bombing of a havana hotel , in 1997 , that killed an italian tourist .

reputedly , when they met in 1991 during the queen 's visit to the white house of george bush senior , george junior introduced himself to the queen as the " black sheep of the family " , and asked the queen who was his equivalent in the windsor family .
sadly , the queen 's reply is not recorded , but young george 's unconventional approach to the british monarch on that occasion was said to have earned him a very stern look from his mother , the redoubtable barbara bush .
president george w bush may have been reminded of that look when , on the south lawn of the white house on monday , he fluffed his lines and suggested that the 81-year-old queen has been on the throne since the 18th century .
presidential wink realising his mistake , and in front of all the cameras , george junior turned to the monarch and winked at her .
now , the queen is not used to being winked at .
and certainly not by a fellow head of state , on a public platform in front of 7,000 people .
" she gave me a look that only a mother could give a child " quipped george , making as graceful a recovery as he could .
what , one wonders , was going through the presidential mind at that moment ?
perhaps the queen 's expression did remind him of reproachful looks he received from his own mother , or other funny looks his idiosyncratic style may have earnt him over the years . "
ten presidents later she was still doing her bit for britain even if that did mean turning a blind eye to george junior 's strange little ways " queen 's joke over gaffe or maybe he was imagining the headlines which would greet his latest gaffe .
because make no mistake , the us media has been full of stories about how the president was being coached on etiquette and protocol to try to prevent him placing one of his hand-tooled texan cowboy boots in his mouth .
those efforts failed .
as the washington post reported the next morning , the white house 's hopes of a gaffe-free visit were dashed within 14 minutes of george w bush greeting the queen .
not , of course , that it mattered in the slightest .
the queen has witnessed far worse faux-pas over the 55 years of her reign to bat an eyelid at a mere bush-ism .
she may well have been a little bemused by the wink , or had a quiet chuckle at the sight of " dubya " looking uncomfortable in his white tie and tails , and she certainly looked a little flummoxed when she proposed a toast to the united states at the state dinner and found herself the only person standing up actually to drink the toast .
part of job but the thing about the queen is that she has seen it all before .
to her , it 's all part of the job .
what will have mattered to her is the fact that this state visit - her fourth to the united states in the past 50 years - has clearly been a success .
the capital city of the world 's superpower is n't an easy place to impress .
there is an understandable superiority about the city .
very , very few official visitors have the power to break through its studied indifference to just about everything that is n't american .
queen elizabeth ii showed that she is one of those visitors who does have the presence to impress washington 's most powerful movers and shakers .
partly it 's because she 's a major-league royal , which carries a mystique outranking any amount of " celebrity " , and arouses a curiosity few be-suited politicians could muster .
partly it 's because of her venerable age and the fact that she has been a witness to , or a participant in , so many world events for so very long .
and partly it 's because it was citizens from her country who , 400 years ago this month -lrb- as her visit recognised -rrb- established the first permanent non-native settlement in north america which , in turn , gave birth to the usa and a military alliance which has been tested in two world wars and various other conflicts .
of course , that military alliance , which has been the bedrock of the so-called " special relationship " , also gave rise to the visit 's trickiest problem .
iraq situation how should the queen deal with the situation that the us and uk find themselves in iraq ?
the solution found by the foreign office , which designs the queen 's programme and writes all her speeches for visits such as this , was virtually to ignore it .
the word " iraq " was uttered only once by the queen and then only in passing in the course of the four official speeches she delivered , which might be thought to be rather strange .
the fact that she could not refer more fully or directly to this shared endeavour between america and britain does , of course , tell its own story .
if iraq had been an unequivocal success , she would have talked about it in her speeches , and offered praise to those who had been involved - as she did to the elder george bush when she visited washington in 1991 after the first gulf war .
no , in the context of a state visit which was intended to underline the success and importance of the relationship between london and washington , iraq was definitely not a subject to dwell on , or indeed to mention at all if it could possibly be avoided .
dutiful as ever , the queen did as she was asked by her government advisers .
she kept her thoughts to herself , about iraq , george w bush and any other contradictions or oddities she may have encountered in the course of her six-day visit to america .
above all whether you are a fan of monarchy or not it would , i suggest , be perverse not to agree that it was a personal triumph for an 81-year-old monarch who first visited washington soon after the second world war , when harry truman was president .
ten presidents later she was still doing her bit for britain even if that did mean turning a blind eye to george junior 's strange little ways .

the fact that she could not refer more fully or directly to this shared endeavour between america and britain does , of course , tell its own story .
if iraq had been an unequivocal success , she would have talked about it in her speeches , and offered praise to those who had been involved - as she did to the elder george bush when she visited washington in 1991 after the first gulf war .
no , in the context of a state visit which was intended to underline the success and importance of the relationship between london and washington , iraq was definitely not a subject to dwell on , or indeed to mention at all if it could possibly be avoided .
dutiful as ever , the queen did as she was asked by her government advisers .
she kept her thoughts to herself , about iraq , george w bush and any other contradictions or oddities she may have encountered in the course of her six-day visit to america .
above all whether you are a fan of monarchy or not it would , i suggest , be perverse not to agree that it was a personal triumph for an 81-year-old monarch who first visited washington soon after the second world war , when harry truman was president .

president bush was coached on etiquette , us media said reputedly , when they met in 1991 during the queen 's visit to the white house of george bush senior , george junior introduced himself to the queen as the " black sheep of the family " , and asked the queen who was his equivalent in the windsor family .
sadly , the queen 's reply is not recorded , but young george 's unconventional approach to the british monarch on that occasion was said to have earned him a very stern look from his mother , the redoubtable barbara bush .
president george w bush may have been reminded of that look when , on the south lawn of the white house on monday , he fluffed his lines and suggested that the 81-year-old queen has been on the throne since the 18th century .
presidential wink realising his mistake , and in front of all the cameras , george junior turned to the monarch and winked at her .
now , the queen is not used to being winked at .
and certainly not by a fellow head of state , on a public platform in front of 7,000 people .
" she gave me a look that only a mother could give a child " quipped george , making as graceful a recovery as he could .
what , one wonders , was going through the presidential mind at that moment ?
perhaps the queen 's expression did remind him of reproachful looks he received from his own mother , or other funny looks his idiosyncratic style may have earnt him over the years .
ten presidents later she was still doing her bit for britain even if that did mean turning a blind eye to george junior 's strange little ways queen 's joke over gaffe or maybe he was imagining the headlines which would greet his latest gaffe .
because make no mistake , the us media has been full of stories about how the president was being coached on etiquette and protocol to try to prevent him placing one of his hand-tooled texan cowboy boots in his mouth .
those efforts failed .
as the washington post reported the next morning , the white house 's hopes of a gaffe-free visit were dashed within 14 minutes of george w bush greeting the queen .
not , of course , that it mattered in the slightest .
the queen has witnessed far worse faux-pas over the 55 years of her reign to bat an eyelid at a mere bush-ism .
she may well have been a little bemused by the wink , or had a quiet chuckle at the sight of " dubya " looking uncomfortable in his white tie and tails , and she certainly looked a little flummoxed when she proposed a toast to the united states at the state dinner and found herself the only person standing up actually to drink the toast .

president bush was coached on etiquette , us media said reputedly , when they met in 1991 during the queen 's visit to the white house of george bush senior , george junior introduced himself to the queen as the " black sheep of the family " , and asked the queen who was his equivalent in the windsor family .
sadly , the queen 's reply is not recorded , but young george 's unconventional approach to the british monarch on that occasion was said to have earned him a very stern look from his mother , the redoubtable barbara bush .
president george w bush may have been reminded of that look when , on the south lawn of the white house on monday , he fluffed his lines and suggested that the 81-year-old queen has been on the throne since the 18th century .
presidential wink realising his mistake , and in front of all the cameras , george junior turned to the monarch and winked at her .
now , the queen is not used to being winked at .
and certainly not by a fellow head of state , on a public platform in front of 7,000 people .
" she gave me a look that only a mother could give a child " quipped george , making as graceful a recovery as he could .
what , one wonders , was going through the presidential mind at that moment ?
perhaps the queen 's expression did remind him of reproachful looks he received from his own mother , or other funny looks his idiosyncratic style may have earnt him over the years .
ten presidents later she was still doing her bit for britain even if that did mean turning a blind eye to george junior 's strange little ways queen 's joke over gaffe or maybe he was imagining the headlines which would greet his latest gaffe .
because make no mistake , the us media has been full of stories about how the president was being coached on etiquette and protocol to try to prevent him placing one of his hand-tooled texan cowboy boots in his mouth .
those efforts failed .
as the washington post reported the next morning , the white house 's hopes of a gaffe-free visit were dashed within 14 minutes of george w bush greeting the queen .
not , of course , that it mattered in the slightest .
the queen has witnessed far worse faux-pas over the 55 years of her reign to bat an eyelid at a mere bush-ism .
she may well have been a little bemused by the wink , or had a quiet chuckle at the sight of " dubya " looking uncomfortable in his white tie and tails , and she certainly looked a little flummoxed when she proposed a toast to the united states at the state dinner and found herself the only person standing up actually to drink the toast .
part of job but the thing about the queen is that she has seen it all before .
to her , it 's all part of the job .
what will have mattered to her is the fact that this state visit - her fourth to the united states in the past 50 years - has clearly been a success .
the capital city of the world 's superpower is n't an easy place to impress .
the queen has impressed people in washington there is an understandable superiority about the city .
very , very few official visitors have the power to break through its studied indifference to just about everything that is n't american .
queen elizabeth ii showed that she is one of those visitors who does have the presence to impress washington 's most powerful movers and shakers .
partly it 's because she 's a major-league royal , which carries a mystique outranking any amount of " celebrity " , and arouses a curiosity few be-suited politicians could muster .
partly it 's because of her venerable age and the fact that she has been a witness to , or a participant in , so many world events for so very long .
and partly it 's because it was citizens from her country who , 400 years ago this month -lrb- as her visit recognised -rrb- established the first permanent non-native settlement in north america which , in turn , gave birth to the usa and a military alliance which has been tested in two world wars and various other conflicts .
of course , that military alliance , which has been the bedrock of the so-called " special relationship " , also gave rise to the visit 's trickiest problem .
iraq situation how should the queen deal with the situation that the us and uk find themselves in iraq ?
the solution found by the foreign office , which designs the queen 's programme and writes all her speeches for visits such as this , was virtually to ignore it .

president bush was coached on etiquette , us media said reputedly , when they met in 1991 during the queen 's visit to the white house of george bush senior , george junior introduced himself to the queen as the " black sheep of the family " , and asked the queen who was his equivalent in the windsor family .
sadly , the queen 's reply is not recorded , but young george 's unconventional approach to the british monarch on that occasion was said to have earned him a very stern look from his mother , the redoubtable barbara bush .
president george w bush may have been reminded of that look when , on the south lawn of the white house on monday , he fluffed his lines and suggested that the 81-year-old queen has been on the throne since the 18th century .
presidential wink realising his mistake , and in front of all the cameras , george junior turned to the monarch and winked at her .
now , the queen is not used to being winked at .
and certainly not by a fellow head of state , on a public platform in front of 7,000 people .
" she gave me a look that only a mother could give a child " quipped george , making as graceful a recovery as he could .
what , one wonders , was going through the presidential mind at that moment ?
perhaps the queen 's expression did remind him of reproachful looks he received from his own mother , or other funny looks his idiosyncratic style may have earnt him over the years .
ten presidents later she was still doing her bit for britain even if that did mean turning a blind eye to george junior 's strange little ways queen 's joke over gaffe or maybe he was imagining the headlines which would greet his latest gaffe .
because make no mistake , the us media has been full of stories about how the president was being coached on etiquette and protocol to try to prevent him placing one of his hand-tooled texan cowboy boots in his mouth .
those efforts failed .
as the washington post reported the next morning , the white house 's hopes of a gaffe-free visit were dashed within 14 minutes of george w bush greeting the queen .
not , of course , that it mattered in the slightest .
the queen has witnessed far worse faux-pas over the 55 years of her reign to bat an eyelid at a mere bush-ism .
she may well have been a little bemused by the wink , or had a quiet chuckle at the sight of " dubya " looking uncomfortable in his white tie and tails , and she certainly looked a little flummoxed when she proposed a toast to the united states at the state dinner and found herself the only person standing up actually to drink the toast .
part of job but the thing about the queen is that she has seen it all before .
to her , it 's all part of the job .
what will have mattered to her is the fact that this state visit - her fourth to the united states in the past 50 years - has clearly been a success .
the capital city of the world 's superpower is n't an easy place to impress .
the queen has impressed people in washington there is an understandable superiority about the city .
very , very few official visitors have the power to break through its studied indifference to just about everything that is n't american .
queen elizabeth ii showed that she is one of those visitors who does have the presence to impress washington 's most powerful movers and shakers .
partly it 's because she 's a major-league royal , which carries a mystique outranking any amount of " celebrity " , and arouses a curiosity few be-suited politicians could muster .
partly it 's because of her venerable age and the fact that she has been a witness to , or a participant in , so many world events for so very long .
and partly it 's because it was citizens from her country who , 400 years ago this month -lrb- as her visit recognised -rrb- established the first permanent non-native settlement in north america which , in turn , gave birth to the usa and a military alliance which has been tested in two world wars and various other conflicts .
of course , that military alliance , which has been the bedrock of the so-called " special relationship " , also gave rise to the visit 's trickiest problem .
iraq situation how should the queen deal with the situation that the us and uk find themselves in iraq ?
the solution found by the foreign office , which designs the queen 's programme and writes all her speeches for visits such as this , was virtually to ignore it .
the queen and prince philip attended a white house state dinner the word " iraq " was uttered only once by the queen and then only in passing in the course of the four official speeches she delivered , which might be thought to be rather strange .
the fact that she could not refer more fully or directly to this shared endeavour between america and britain does , of course , tell its own story .
if iraq had been an unequivocal success , she would have talked about it in her speeches , and offered praise to those who had been involved - as she did to the elder george bush when she visited washington in 1991 after the first gulf war .
no , in the context of a state visit which was intended to underline the success and importance of the relationship between london and washington , iraq was definitely not a subject to dwell on , or indeed to mention at all if it could possibly be avoided .
dutiful as ever , the queen did as she was asked by her government advisers .
she kept her thoughts to herself , about iraq , george w bush and any other contradictions or oddities she may have encountered in the course of her six-day visit to america .
above all whether you are a fan of monarchy or not it would , i suggest , be perverse not to agree that it was a personal triumph for an 81-year-old monarch who first visited washington soon after the second world war , when harry truman was president .
ten presidents later she was still doing her bit for britain even if that did mean turning a blind eye to george junior 's strange little ways .

it follows the recent case of deanne asamoah - a 13-year-old girl who died from an overdose of morphine .
it emerged she had been caring for her terminally ill mother for four years .
the princess royal trust for carers says tens of thousands of children struggle to provide care to ill or elderly people with little or no help .
deanne fell into a coma and died after swallowing seven morphine tablets three days after her 13th birthday .
i accept that the level of support in some cases is falling short of what should be there beverley hughes children 's minister doctors placed her on a life-support machine but it was switched off after tests revealed that she was brain dead .
at the inquest into her death last month the coroner said he would write to beverley hughes , the children 's minister , asking why it was that up to 750 young people in deane 's home town of milton keynes were struggling to cope with such heavy responsibilities .
it is estimated that there are 175,000 young carers in the uk .
alex fox , assistant director of the princess royal trust , said local authorities often failed to spot the problem .
" children 's services and adults ' services are completely separate entities in local councils , so you might have a mentally-ill parent , say , who 's getting some support from mental health services , but often those practitioners think things to do with parenting and children are beyond their remit .
" so they often do n't ask basic questions like ' do you have children and can we help you in your parenting role ? '
" stresses deanne went to a project for young carers in milton keynes called carers bucks .
her friend hannah , who visited her when she was in a coma in hospital , also makes use of the facility .
hannah 's mother had meningitis and suffers memory loss and has fits , and she says her father is part-paraplegic and weighs 18 stone -lrb- 114kg -rrb- .
she has been the main carer since 2001 - she has just turned 17 .
" if you think about it all at once and you think about all the different stresses you have - like school , home situation - then you just collapse - you ca n't get up again .
" so you 've got to take it bit by bit .
i just sit down and i 'll cry myself to sleep until i sleep .
" but no matter how much you cry it will never go away , it 's still there when you get up in the morning - so you 've just got to take it day by day , i suppose . "
integrated services ms hughes said the government had overseen a closer integration of caring services , designed to give every family an appropriate level of care .
however , she said the circumstances in some families were complex and difficult .
" i accept that the level of support in some cases is falling short of what should be there .
" they -lsb- young carers -rsb- should not have to miss their childhood . "
tim loughton , the shadow health minister , said : " these young carers make an invaluable contribution to society and greatly reduce the burden on the state .
" in return it is critical that the government develop policies which ensure they lead fulfilling and emotionally stable childhoods and have the necessary help to succeed at school . "
chancellor gordon brown has announced a national review of carers will take place later this year .

at the inquest into her death last month the coroner said he would write to beverley hughes , the children 's minister , asking why it was that up to 750 young people in deane 's home town of milton keynes were struggling to cope with such heavy responsibilities .
it is estimated that there are 175,000 young carers in the uk .
alex fox , assistant director of the princess royal trust , said local authorities often failed to spot the problem .
" children 's services and adults ' services are completely separate entities in local councils , so you might have a mentally-ill parent , say , who 's getting some support from mental health services , but often those practitioners think things to do with parenting and children are beyond their remit .
" so they often do n't ask basic questions like ' do you have children and can we help you in your parenting role ? '
" stresses deanne went to a project for young carers in milton keynes called carers bucks .
her friend hannah , who visited her when she was in a coma in hospital , also makes use of the facility .
hannah 's mother had meningitis and suffers memory loss and has fits , and she says her father is part-paraplegic and weighs 18 stone -lrb- 114kg -rrb- .
she has been the main carer since 2001 - she has just turned 17 .
" if you think about it all at once and you think about all the different stresses you have - like school , home situation - then you just collapse - you ca n't get up again .
" so you 've got to take it bit by bit .
i just sit down and i 'll cry myself to sleep until i sleep .
" but no matter how much you cry it will never go away , it 's still there when you get up in the morning - so you 've just got to take it day by day , i suppose . "
integrated services ms hughes said the government had overseen a closer integration of caring services , designed to give every family an appropriate level of care .
however , she said the circumstances in some families were complex and difficult .
" i accept that the level of support in some cases is falling short of what should be there .
" they -lsb- young carers -rsb- should not have to miss their childhood . "
tim loughton , the shadow health minister , said : " these young carers make an invaluable contribution to society and greatly reduce the burden on the state .
" in return it is critical that the government develop policies which ensure they lead fulfilling and emotionally stable childhoods and have the necessary help to succeed at school . "
chancellor gordon brown has announced a national review of carers will take place later this year .

it follows the recent case of deanne asamoah - a 13-year-old girl who died from an overdose of morphine .
it emerged she had been caring for her terminally ill mother for four years .
the princess royal trust for carers says tens of thousands of children struggle to provide care to ill or elderly people with little or no help .
deanne fell into a coma and died after swallowing seven morphine tablets three days after her 13th birthday . "
i accept that the level of support in some cases is falling short of what should be there " beverley hughes children 's minister doctors placed her on a life-support machine but it was switched off after tests revealed that she was brain dead .
at the inquest into her death last month the coroner said he would write to beverley hughes , the children 's minister , asking why it was that up to 750 young people in deane 's home town of milton keynes were struggling to cope with such heavy responsibilities .
it is estimated that there are 175,000 young carers in the uk .
alex fox , assistant director of the princess royal trust , said local authorities often failed to spot the problem .
" children 's services and adults ' services are completely separate entities in local councils , so you might have a mentally-ill parent , say , who 's getting some support from mental health services , but often those practitioners think things to do with parenting and children are beyond their remit .
" so they often do n't ask basic questions like ' do you have children and can we help you in your parenting role ? '
" stresses deanne went to a project for young carers in milton keynes called carers bucks .
her friend hannah , who visited her when she was in a coma in hospital , also makes use of the facility .
hannah 's mother had meningitis and suffers memory loss and has fits , and she says her father is part-paraplegic and weighs 18 stone -lrb- 114kg -rrb- .
she has been the main carer since 2001 - she has just turned 17 .

but after east timor voted to break away from indonesian rule in august 1999 , there was no other serious contender .
after leading his nation for the first tentative years of independence , he announced that he would step aside from the presidency early in 2007 , and is now concentrating on campaigning to become the prime minister in parliamentary elections in june .
mr gusmao is a legend among his people .
he fought an armed rebellion against indonesian rule for two decades , spent more than six years in an indonesian prison and under house arrest .
he was released on 7 september 1999 , just days after east timor 's landmark referendum result was announced .
the vote sparked a wave of bloodshed led by pro-jakarta militias opposed to independence .
while president , mr gusmao made it clear he favoured an amnesty for those accused of the violence - putting him at odds with his former political party , fretilin -lrb- revolutionary front for an independent east timor -rrb- , which controls the legislature elected in august 2001 .
there have been reports of tensions between the two , with mr gusmao making veiled attacks on unnamed government members for leading a lavish lifestyle while normal people went without basic healthcare and education .
' supernatural status ' a charismatic man of the people , mr gusmao vowed to devote his five-year term to being the people 's " eyes , ears and mouth " .
but with so much to live up to , there was always a risk he would become the kind of leader mr gusmao had himself criticised .
" no , i do not want to become president , because if you look at almost every revolutionary struggle , the leaders who are there while in opposition become leaders of a new nation and they have nothing more to give , ' he once said .
born in the town of manatuto on 20 june 1946 jose alexandre gusmao was the second son in a family of nine children .
he spent four years at a jesuit seminary in dare , in the hills overlooking dili , and attended dili high school .
he did three years compulsory service in the colonial portuguese forces and later worked in the local government department of the colonial administration .
while in prison he wrote poetry and painted , earning the description " poet warrior " .
it added to the almost supernatural status he attained during his life in the jungle .
one such myth was that he had powers to turn into a creature to evade capture .
mr gusmao and his second wife , long-time australian partner kirsty sword , have three children .
he also has two children from a previous marriage .

born in the town of manatuto on 20 june 1946 jose alexandre gusmao was the second son in a family of nine children .

the vote sparked a wave of bloodshed led by pro-jakarta militias opposed to independence .
while president , mr gusmao made it clear he favoured an amnesty for those accused of the violence - putting him at odds with his former political party , fretilin -lrb- revolutionary front for an independent east timor -rrb- , which controls the legislature elected in august 2001 .
there have been reports of tensions between the two , with mr gusmao making veiled attacks on unnamed government members for leading a lavish lifestyle while normal people went without basic healthcare and education .
' supernatural status ' a charismatic man of the people , mr gusmao vowed to devote his five-year term to being the people 's " eyes , ears and mouth " .
but with so much to live up to , there was always a risk he would become the kind of leader mr gusmao had himself criticised .
" no , i do not want to become president , because if you look at almost every revolutionary struggle , the leaders who are there while in opposition become leaders of a new nation and they have nothing more to give , ' he once said .
born in the town of manatuto on 20 june 1946 jose alexandre gusmao was the second son in a family of nine children .
he spent four years at a jesuit seminary in dare , in the hills overlooking dili , and attended dili high school .
he did three years compulsory service in the colonial portuguese forces and later worked in the local government department of the colonial administration .
while in prison he wrote poetry and painted , earning the description " poet warrior " .
it added to the almost supernatural status he attained during his life in the jungle .
one such myth was that he had powers to turn into a creature to evade capture .
mr gusmao and his second wife , long-time australian partner kirsty sword , have three children .
he also has two children from a previous marriage .

but after east timor voted to break away from indonesian rule in august 1999 , there was no other serious contender .
after leading his nation for the first tentative years of independence , he announced that he would step aside from the presidency early in 2007 , and is now concentrating on campaigning to become the prime minister in parliamentary elections in june .
mr gusmao is a legend among his people .
he fought an armed rebellion against indonesian rule for two decades , spent more than six years in an indonesian prison and under house arrest .
he was released on 7 september 1999 , just days after east timor 's landmark referendum result was announced .
the vote sparked a wave of bloodshed led by pro-jakarta militias opposed to independence .
while president , mr gusmao made it clear he favoured an amnesty for those accused of the violence - putting him at odds with his former political party , fretilin -lrb- revolutionary front for an independent east timor -rrb- , which controls the legislature elected in august 2001 .
there have been reports of tensions between the two , with mr gusmao making veiled attacks on unnamed government members for leading a lavish lifestyle while normal people went without basic healthcare and education .
' supernatural status ' a charismatic man of the people , mr gusmao vowed to devote his five-year term to being the people 's " eyes , ears and mouth " .
but with so much to live up to , there was always a risk he would become the kind of leader mr gusmao had himself criticised .
" no , i do not want to become president , because if you look at almost every revolutionary struggle , the leaders who are there while in opposition become leaders of a new nation and they have nothing more to give , ' he once said .
born in the town of manatuto on 20 june 1946 jose alexandre gusmao was the second son in a family of nine children .
he spent four years at a jesuit seminary in dare , in the hills overlooking dili , and attended dili high school .
he did three years compulsory service in the colonial portuguese forces and later worked in the local government department of the colonial administration .
while in prison he wrote poetry and painted , earning the description " poet warrior " .
it added to the almost supernatural status he attained during his life in the jungle .
one such myth was that he had powers to turn into a creature to evade capture .
mr gusmao and his second wife , long-time australian partner kirsty sword , have three children .
he also has two children from a previous marriage .

false claims cost the industry £ 4m a day , adding £ 40 to the average premium paid by policyholders , the association of british insurers -lrb- abi -rrb- said .
deliberate spills or cigarette burns on carpets and furniture , in order to make false insurance claims , were common examples of fraud , the abi said .
the trade body canvassed the views of almost 7,000 people for its survey .
' more resources ' one-in-10 of respondents admitted to having cheated their insurance company , the abi said . "
these figures highlight that greater deterrents , such as criminal prosecutions , are needed to discourage fraud " nick starling , abi about half the total cost of dishonest claims occurred under home contents and buildings insurance , the organisation added .
exaggerated claims for injury against local authorities - following a trip over paving stones - or overestimating the value of personal items lost while on holiday were other common examples of insurance fraud , the abi said .
the organisation also cited the example of one man who claimed he was unable to walk following an accident , but was later photographed in his local paper collecting the top goal scorer award for his local football team .
" honest customers should not have to pay for cheats , " said nick starling , the abi 's director of general insurance and health .
" these figures highlight that greater deterrents , such as criminal prosecutions , are needed to discourage fraud .
this is why we are calling for police forces to be given more resources so that fraud can be treated with the seriousness it deserves . "
the abi represents almost 400 companies , which account for more than 91 % of all insurance business in the uk .

some 15,000 people are swaying in front of him , their hands raised in the air .
this is not a pop concert , but a catholic mass in sao paulo , brazil , celebrated by the country 's best-known priest , known to everyone as padre marcelo .
the former aerobics teacher turned cleric is now so popular that his cds outsell every pop star in the country .
the turnout in a converted factory is encouraging news for the catholic church after a long period of declining numbers .
that long term fall coincides with growing pressure from brazil 's pentecostal churches , which have been expanding rapidly .
the pentecostal churches , referred to here under the umbrella title of " evangelicals " - which includes other protestant churches - are a powerful force in brazil , with growing media empires , significant political representation , and more than 24 million followers .
catholic concern brazil still enjoys the position as the largest catholic country in the world , with some 125 million followers recorded in 2000 .
but according to the us pew forum on religion and public life , successive brazilian censuses show the catholic share of the population decreased by 4.1 % in the 20 years from 1960 to 1980 , and dropped almost three times as much in the next 20 years .
by contrast , the number of protestants increased by 2.6 % between 1960 and 1980 , but more than tripled the rate of increase in the following 20 years .
in a sense , padre marcelo 's " charismatic " -style masses have shown that one form of response from the catholic church to this growing challenge has been to imitate at least some of the spontaneous style of the pentecostal services .
church leaders concede that pope benedict , who is due in sao paulo this week , is uneasy about the downward trend in catholic numbers in latin america .
" worried is not the word , but he is concerned , " dom odilo scherer , sao paulo 's new archbishop , told the bbc news website .
" i think there is no bishop or pastor in the church who is not concerned .
we are not very present in the large cities .
one priest is not sufficient for 100,000 people . "
by contrast , it seems almost as soon as a new district emerged in brazil 's sprawling cities , a new evangelical temple or church soon followed .
for the poor who moved to the cities , these churches provided a ready-made social network . "
this -lsb- evangelical -rsb- world is full of possibilities , of work , of getting to know people , of marriage .
in this sense they are more connected to a social group , and they can fit in to the city life " professor paula monteiro , sao paulo university send us your views " they arrived here totally lost , " says professor paula monteiro , of sao paulo university .
" and when they get into their little churches they start building a network , creating a world within which they can operate in the city .
" this world is full of possibilities , of work , of getting to know people , of marriage .
in this sense they are more connected to a social group , and they can fit in to the city life . "
the churches appear to have been particularly adept at helping many people deal with the day-to-day problems of life such as excessive drinking or drug abuse .
in a developing country like brazil , their emphasis on self-improvement and success in this life has also gone down well .
finding new words leonardo boff , a former priest and brazil 's best-known voice of liberation theology , says the catholic church must take responsibility for the decline in numbers .
" i believe the fault is that of the catholic church itself , and the rigid dogma and inability to create a new language , " he says .
" so many people leave and look for other churches , which have more populist language , and they are more welcoming and they allow for a sacred experience , an experience of god which is easier and more immediate . "
boff was once silenced for a year by the then cardinal ratzinger , now , of course , pope benedict , so his views may not cut much ice in rome .
even scandal , it seems , has not prevented the newest evangelical pentecostal churches from growing at an impressive rate .
over the years controversy has surrounded their relentless fundraising , often among the poorest of brazilian society , and there have been damaging images of some church leaders on their knees counting money a little too gleefully .
in a hugely controversial incident , a pentecostal minister was seen late at night on tv kicking a statue of brazil 's national saint .
two founders of one church , renascer em cristo or reborn in christ , were recently arrested in the united states accused of smuggling thousands of dollars into the country , some of which was said to have been concealed inside a bible .
they deny any wrongdoing .
changing times the catholic church may take some comfort from a new study of government statistics by the getulio vargas foundation , which suggests that this decline is stabilising , but the full picture will not be clear until the next census .
and church leaders will be hoping that the visit by the pope , during which he will canonise the first brazilian-born saint , frei galvao , will give a boost to morale .
the pope may have other pressing issues on his mind when he visits brazil .
the health minister here has recently said he would like to see a wide-ranging debate on the issue of abortion - currently permitted only in limited circumstances - a suggestion that has already prompted a vigorous response from senior clergy .
opinion polls suggest the vast majority of brazilians do not endorse the teachings of the church on birth control , and a wider discussion is under way about the ethics of stem cell research using embryos .
in one of his engagements , the pope will speak to thousands of young people in a football stadium .
their future , and the future of the church in the world 's largest catholic country , will be weighing on his mind .

padre marcelo rossi is more popular than brazil 's pop stars some 15,000 people are swaying in front of him , their hands raised in the air .
this is not a pop concert , but a catholic mass in sao paulo , brazil , celebrated by the country 's best-known priest , known to everyone as padre marcelo .
the former aerobics teacher turned cleric is now so popular that his cds outsell every pop star in the country .
the turnout in a converted factory is encouraging news for the catholic church after a long period of declining numbers .
that long term fall coincides with growing pressure from brazil 's pentecostal churches , which have been expanding rapidly .
the pentecostal churches , referred to here under the umbrella title of " evangelicals " - which includes other protestant churches - are a powerful force in brazil , with growing media empires , significant political representation , and more than 24 million followers .

around 15,000 people attend padre marcelo 's regular mass but according to the us pew forum on religion and public life , successive brazilian censuses show the catholic share of the population decreased by 4.1 % in the 20 years from 1960 to 1980 , and dropped almost three times as much in the next 20 years .
by contrast , the number of protestants increased by 2.6 % between 1960 and 1980 , but more than tripled the rate of increase in the following 20 years .
in a sense , padre marcelo 's " charismatic " -style masses have shown that one form of response from the catholic church to this growing challenge has been to imitate at least some of the spontaneous style of the pentecostal services .

" worried is not the word , but he is concerned , " dom odilo scherer , sao paulo 's new archbishop , told the bbc news website .

the health minister here has recently said he would like to see a wide-ranging debate on the issue of abortion - currently permitted only in limited circumstances - a suggestion that has already prompted a vigorous response from senior clergy .
opinion polls suggest the vast majority of brazilians do not endorse the teachings of the church on birth control , and a wider discussion is under way about the ethics of stem cell research using embryos .
in one of his engagements , the pope will speak to thousands of young people in a football stadium .
their future , and the future of the church in the world 's largest catholic country , will be weighing on his mind .
