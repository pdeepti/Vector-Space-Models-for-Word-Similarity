program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 23.09.2007 shared mealtimes a lost tradition in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who wants salad when you can have this ?
dw-world.de talked to nutritional psychologist volker pudel of göttingen university about the evolving role of food in contemporary society and why germans love cooking shows . dw-world.de : as a nutritional psychologist , what do you make of the changes in eating habits over the last few decades ?
is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .
in recent decades , cooking skills have worsened rapidly .
twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .
according to our calculations , by 2020 no one will be able to roast a beef roulade anymore , because they wo n't know how to do it .
convenience food is filling the gap .
i predict that soon , apartments will no longer necessarily feature kitchens .
a microwave is enough to heat up bought meals .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are rituals that traditionally take place within a community .
what happens to food when these rituals no longer take place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kitchens might soon become historical curiosities we 've already moved away from shared mealtimes .
fast food and eating on the go are gaining ground .
eating behavior has become more flexible and determined by the situations we 're in .
in the process , we 've lost a regular basis for the sort of familial communication that should be taking place at the dinner table .
the shift from private to public eating also means that we lose any emotional attachment to food and its provenance because we 're no longer buying and preparing it .
-lsb- in a restaurant -rsb- the atmosphere is considered more important than what is on the plate .
and with the food trade conditioning german consumers to pay discount prices , rock-bottom cost instead of quality has become the first priority .
these trends are hard to reverse , because they have been entrenched over decades .
these days , chefs are seen as artists .
catalan chef ferran adria was invited to documenta 12 .
other famous chefs have their own tv shows and thousands of viewers watch their live performances .
has cooking become an art because it no longer takes place at home ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer is one of germany 's most famous tv cooks television can provide pseudo-satisfaction when it addresses issues neglected in people 's private lives .
the more passive germans become , the higher the ratings of sports shows .
the same applies to cooking shows , which elevate cooking to fine art at the same time as entertaining .
tv chefs demonstrate how cooking can be an event , rather than a necessity .
this distinction is also apparent in the home .
the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .
event cooking is communicative , basic cooking is just hard work .
cooking shows are hugely successful these days .
but it seems that the better tv cooking gets , the worse people eat .
how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "
meat scandals are popular media stories which ultimately leave consumers scared , even though the media usually fails to assess the risk objectively .
on the other hand , the media use the topic of food less in an advisory role but rather as entertainment - the presentation of the recipes makes it hard to actually cook them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the supermarket 's " homemade " aisle the advertising industry has long been instrumentalizing food .
barely any meals are produced in german kitchens that do n't feature convenience products .
consumers are no longer even aware of how many convenience foods they are using , and surveys show that in fact , the majority of people say they do n't like them .
the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "
over 90 percent of people use a packet or a powder to make what they call a " homemade " sauce .
standardized products lead to standardized tastes .

dw-world.de talked to nutritional psychologist volker pudel of göttingen university about the evolving role of food in contemporary society and why germans love cooking shows . dw-world.de : as a nutritional psychologist , what do you make of the changes in eating habits over the last few decades ?
is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .
in recent decades , cooking skills have worsened rapidly .
twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .
according to our calculations , by 2020 no one will be able to roast a beef roulade anymore , because they wo n't know how to do it .
convenience food is filling the gap .
i predict that soon , apartments will no longer necessarily feature kitchens .
a microwave is enough to heat up bought meals .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are rituals that traditionally take place within a community .
what happens to food when these rituals no longer take place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kitchens might soon become historical curiosities we 've already moved away from shared mealtimes .
fast food and eating on the go are gaining ground .
eating behavior has become more flexible and determined by the situations we 're in .
in the process , we 've lost a regular basis for the sort of familial communication that should be taking place at the dinner table .
the shift from private to public eating also means that we lose any emotional attachment to food and its provenance because we 're no longer buying and preparing it .
-lsb- in a restaurant -rsb- the atmosphere is considered more important than what is on the plate .
and with the food trade conditioning german consumers to pay discount prices , rock-bottom cost instead of quality has become the first priority .
these trends are hard to reverse , because they have been entrenched over decades .
these days , chefs are seen as artists .
catalan chef ferran adria was invited to documenta 12 .
other famous chefs have their own tv shows and thousands of viewers watch their live performances .
has cooking become an art because it no longer takes place at home ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer is one of germany 's most famous tv cooks television can provide pseudo-satisfaction when it addresses issues neglected in people 's private lives .
the more passive germans become , the higher the ratings of sports shows .
the same applies to cooking shows , which elevate cooking to fine art at the same time as entertaining .
tv chefs demonstrate how cooking can be an event , rather than a necessity .
this distinction is also apparent in the home .
the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .
event cooking is communicative , basic cooking is just hard work .
cooking shows are hugely successful these days .
but it seems that the better tv cooking gets , the worse people eat .
how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "
meat scandals are popular media stories which ultimately leave consumers scared , even though the media usually fails to assess the risk objectively .
on the other hand , the media use the topic of food less in an advisory role but rather as entertainment - the presentation of the recipes makes it hard to actually cook them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the supermarket 's " homemade " aisle the advertising industry has long been instrumentalizing food .
barely any meals are produced in german kitchens that do n't feature convenience products .
consumers are no longer even aware of how many convenience foods they are using , and surveys show that in fact , the majority of people say they do n't like them .
the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "
over 90 percent of people use a packet or a powder to make what they call a " homemade " sauce .
standardized products lead to standardized tastes .
children who are brought up on long-life milk do n't like fresh milk .

dw-world.de talked to nutritional psychologist volker pudel of göttingen university about the evolving role of food in contemporary society and why germans love cooking shows . dw-world.de : as a nutritional psychologist , what do you make of the changes in eating habits over the last few decades ?
is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .
in recent decades , cooking skills have worsened rapidly .
twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .
according to our calculations , by 2020 no one will be able to roast a beef roulade anymore , because they wo n't know how to do it .
convenience food is filling the gap .
i predict that soon , apartments will no longer necessarily feature kitchens .
a microwave is enough to heat up bought meals .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are rituals that traditionally take place within a community .
what happens to food when these rituals no longer take place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kitchens might soon become historical curiosities we 've already moved away from shared mealtimes .
fast food and eating on the go are gaining ground .
eating behavior has become more flexible and determined by the situations we 're in .
in the process , we 've lost a regular basis for the sort of familial communication that should be taking place at the dinner table .
the shift from private to public eating also means that we lose any emotional attachment to food and its provenance because we 're no longer buying and preparing it .
-lsb- in a restaurant -rsb- the atmosphere is considered more important than what is on the plate .
and with the food trade conditioning german consumers to pay discount prices , rock-bottom cost instead of quality has become the first priority .
these trends are hard to reverse , because they have been entrenched over decades .
these days , chefs are seen as artists .
catalan chef ferran adria was invited to documenta 12 .
other famous chefs have their own tv shows and thousands of viewers watch their live performances .
has cooking become an art because it no longer takes place at home ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer is one of germany 's most famous tv cooks television can provide pseudo-satisfaction when it addresses issues neglected in people 's private lives .
the more passive germans become , the higher the ratings of sports shows .
the same applies to cooking shows , which elevate cooking to fine art at the same time as entertaining .
tv chefs demonstrate how cooking can be an event , rather than a necessity .
this distinction is also apparent in the home .
the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .
event cooking is communicative , basic cooking is just hard work .
cooking shows are hugely successful these days .
but it seems that the better tv cooking gets , the worse people eat .
how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "
meat scandals are popular media stories which ultimately leave consumers scared , even though the media usually fails to assess the risk objectively .
on the other hand , the media use the topic of food less in an advisory role but rather as entertainment - the presentation of the recipes makes it hard to actually cook them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the supermarket 's " homemade " aisle the advertising industry has long been instrumentalizing food .
barely any meals are produced in german kitchens that do n't feature convenience products .
consumers are no longer even aware of how many convenience foods they are using , and surveys show that in fact , the majority of people say they do n't like them .
the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "
over 90 percent of people use a packet or a powder to make what they call a " homemade " sauce .
standardized products lead to standardized tastes .
children who are brought up on long-life milk do n't like fresh milk .
the same goes for strawberry yoghurts with flavor enhancers .
we 're losing regional tastes , because the products people buy can be bought everywhere .
surveys show that viewers enjoy cooking shows .
do you think they have psychological benefits ?
audiences definitely love cooking shows .
the chefs demonstrate what 's possible to do in the kitchen .
but they have a circus appeal , they 're good entertainment .
now and then the viewer might think they could cook something similar , but then they forget all about it .
but cooking shows put the focus on what 's missing from many german kitchens .
they beam into the living room an ideal of sensory pleasure , albeit one than can only be enjoyed visually , rather than by our senses of taste and smell .
i can not judge whether a wonderful meal enjoyed only visually is positive for the psyche .
i personally like to eat what i cook . what does the future hold ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children know what is healthy , whether they choose to eat it is another matter the problem is two-fold .
on the one hand , bad nutrition is fast becoming a serious health risk .
the majority of germans are overweight and there is no end in sight to this trend .
secondly , eating as a key part of our standard of living is increasingly out-of-house .
standardized meals , the disintegration of the shared meal tradition , worsening cooking skills are just some of the issues .
it is hard to understand why a society in which everything is so regimented ignores the issue of food .
kindergartens , schools , offices , hospitals and retirements homes can offer whatever food they want , so long as they meet hygiene requirements .

23 .
the historic encounter - the first of its kind - drew fierce criticism from chinese officials . according to german news agency dpa , chinese officials - unlike in the past - are not censoring insulting internet postings directed against merkel that refer to the chancellor as a " witch " and say that she 's " playing with fire . " beijing accuses the dalai lama of promoting independence for tibet , which chinese soldiers occupied in 1950 .
the dalai lama has led a tibetan government-in-exile in india since 1959 .
he says that he does not seek independence , but autonomy for his homeland . chinese officials , who had called on germany not to allow the dalai lama to enter the country , also cancelled a high-level meeting with german justice minister brigitte zypries on patent right protection that was meant to take place sunday in munich .
" technical reasons " were the official explanation for the cancellation , according to a justice ministry spokesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing in august merkel had been under pressure for days to cancel the meeting that government officials describe as a " private exchange of ideas . "
foreign ministry officials reportedly urged merkel to cancel the visit to avoid any damage to sino-german relations . but government spokesman thomas steg said that it should be seen as part of a series of meetings between the chancellor and global religious leaders .

dw-world.de talked to nutritional psychologist volker pudel of göttingen university about the evolving role of food in contemporary society and why germans love cooking shows . dw-world.de : as a nutritional psychologist , what do you make of the changes in eating habits over the last few decades ?
is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .
in recent decades , cooking skills have worsened rapidly .
twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .
according to our calculations , by 2020 no one will be able to roast a beef roulade anymore , because they wo n't know how to do it .
convenience food is filling the gap .
i predict that soon , apartments will no longer necessarily feature kitchens .
a microwave is enough to heat up bought meals .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are rituals that traditionally take place within a community .
what happens to food when these rituals no longer take place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kitchens might soon become historical curiosities we 've already moved away from shared mealtimes .
fast food and eating on the go are gaining ground .
eating behavior has become more flexible and determined by the situations we 're in .
in the process , we 've lost a regular basis for the sort of familial communication that should be taking place at the dinner table .
the shift from private to public eating also means that we lose any emotional attachment to food and its provenance because we 're no longer buying and preparing it .
-lsb- in a restaurant -rsb- the atmosphere is considered more important than what is on the plate .
and with the food trade conditioning german consumers to pay discount prices , rock-bottom cost instead of quality has become the first priority .
these trends are hard to reverse , because they have been entrenched over decades .
these days , chefs are seen as artists .
catalan chef ferran adria was invited to documenta 12 .
other famous chefs have their own tv shows and thousands of viewers watch their live performances .
has cooking become an art because it no longer takes place at home ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer is one of germany 's most famous tv cooks television can provide pseudo-satisfaction when it addresses issues neglected in people 's private lives .
the more passive germans become , the higher the ratings of sports shows .
the same applies to cooking shows , which elevate cooking to fine art at the same time as entertaining .
tv chefs demonstrate how cooking can be an event , rather than a necessity .
this distinction is also apparent in the home .
the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .
event cooking is communicative , basic cooking is just hard work .
cooking shows are hugely successful these days .
but it seems that the better tv cooking gets , the worse people eat .
how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "
meat scandals are popular media stories which ultimately leave consumers scared , even though the media usually fails to assess the risk objectively .
on the other hand , the media use the topic of food less in an advisory role but rather as entertainment - the presentation of the recipes makes it hard to actually cook them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the supermarket 's " homemade " aisle the advertising industry has long been instrumentalizing food .
barely any meals are produced in german kitchens that do n't feature convenience products .
consumers are no longer even aware of how many convenience foods they are using , and surveys show that in fact , the majority of people say they do n't like them .
the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "
over 90 percent of people use a packet or a powder to make what they call a " homemade " sauce .
standardized products lead to standardized tastes .
children who are brought up on long-life milk do n't like fresh milk .
the same goes for strawberry yoghurts with flavor enhancers .
we 're losing regional tastes , because the products people buy can be bought everywhere .
surveys show that viewers enjoy cooking shows .
do you think they have psychological benefits ?
audiences definitely love cooking shows .
the chefs demonstrate what 's possible to do in the kitchen .
but they have a circus appeal , they 're good entertainment .
now and then the viewer might think they could cook something similar , but then they forget all about it .
but cooking shows put the focus on what 's missing from many german kitchens .
they beam into the living room an ideal of sensory pleasure , albeit one than can only be enjoyed visually , rather than by our senses of taste and smell .
i can not judge whether a wonderful meal enjoyed only visually is positive for the psyche .
i personally like to eat what i cook . what does the future hold ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children know what is healthy , whether they choose to eat it is another matter the problem is two-fold .
on the one hand , bad nutrition is fast becoming a serious health risk .
the majority of germans are overweight and there is no end in sight to this trend .
secondly , eating as a key part of our standard of living is increasingly out-of-house .
standardized meals , the disintegration of the shared meal tradition , worsening cooking skills are just some of the issues .
it is hard to understand why a society in which everything is so regimented ignores the issue of food .
kindergartens , schools , offices , hospitals and retirements homes can offer whatever food they want , so long as they meet hygiene requirements .
children would be given a better basis for later eating patterns were they to be taught cooking at school , were they to take part in trips to farms as a way of developing an emotional relationship to the provenance of food .

23 .
the historic encounter - the first of its kind - drew fierce criticism from chinese officials . according to german news agency dpa , chinese officials - unlike in the past - are not censoring insulting internet postings directed against merkel that refer to the chancellor as a " witch " and say that she 's " playing with fire . " beijing accuses the dalai lama of promoting independence for tibet , which chinese soldiers occupied in 1950 .
the dalai lama has led a tibetan government-in-exile in india since 1959 .
he says that he does not seek independence , but autonomy for his homeland . chinese officials , who had called on germany not to allow the dalai lama to enter the country , also cancelled a high-level meeting with german justice minister brigitte zypries on patent right protection that was meant to take place sunday in munich .
" technical reasons " were the official explanation for the cancellation , according to a justice ministry spokesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing in august merkel had been under pressure for days to cancel the meeting that government officials describe as a " private exchange of ideas . "
foreign ministry officials reportedly urged merkel to cancel the visit to avoid any damage to sino-german relations . but government spokesman thomas steg said that it should be seen as part of a series of meetings between the chancellor and global religious leaders . " the meeting will take place , the invitation stands , and the chancellor also extended the invitation very consciously , " he said on friday , adding that the government was convinced that the encounter " will not disturb the good state of german-chinese relations and cooperation . " support for chancellor across political spectrum hesse premier roland koch , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union and a long-time supporter of the dalai lama , said sunday that he was glad that merkel did not give in to chinese pressure . " we germans can be happy and proud that human rights issues mean so much to angela merkel and that she talks straight and acts accordingly , " koch , who accompanied the dalai lama to the chancellery , told bild am sonntag tabloid . claudia roth , the leader of the opposition greens party , also backed merkel , saying that the chancellor acted responsibly by meeting with the dalai lama .
in an interview with german public radio deutschlandfunk , roth , the human rights commissioner under the previous red-green coalition government , said that human rights in tibet were in germany 's interest . dalai lama : china displays " arrogance of power " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama presented merkel with his signature gift - a white scarf in an interview with süddeutsche zeitung published saturday , the dalai lama said that he did n't think the meeting would have a lasting negative effect on relations between the two countries . " it is simply china 's attitude , " he said .
" it is the arrogance of power .
beijing is meddling in the domestic affairs of germany and demanding that the german chancellor should not see me … wherever i go , china protests .
the chinese are simply testing how far they can go . " merkel and the dalai lama posed for photographs following their meeting at the chancellery , but did not make any statements to the press .
as he was leaving the chancellery , the dalai lama said that merkel had " kept old friendships , so -lsb- i 'm -rsb- very happy , " according to news reports . merkel sets precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush has met the tibetan spiritual leader on several occasions it was the first time the dalai lama visited the german chancellery as none of merkel 's predecessors received him . the tibetan leader , who won the nobel peace prize in 1989 , has met with other high-ranking german officials in the past , including former president richard von weizsäcker and former foreign ministers joschka fischer and klaus kinkel . the latter 's refusal to accept a white scarf - the dalai lama 's signature gift as a sign of peace - made headlines at the time . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to nutritional psychologist volker pudel of göttingen university about the evolving role of food in contemporary society and why germans love cooking shows . dw-world.de : as a nutritional psychologist , what do you make of the changes in eating habits over the last few decades ?
is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .
in recent decades , cooking skills have worsened rapidly .
twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .
according to our calculations , by 2020 no one will be able to roast a beef roulade anymore , because they wo n't know how to do it .
convenience food is filling the gap .
i predict that soon , apartments will no longer necessarily feature kitchens .
a microwave is enough to heat up bought meals .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are rituals that traditionally take place within a community .
what happens to food when these rituals no longer take place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kitchens might soon become historical curiosities we 've already moved away from shared mealtimes .
fast food and eating on the go are gaining ground .
eating behavior has become more flexible and determined by the situations we 're in .
in the process , we 've lost a regular basis for the sort of familial communication that should be taking place at the dinner table .
the shift from private to public eating also means that we lose any emotional attachment to food and its provenance because we 're no longer buying and preparing it .
-lsb- in a restaurant -rsb- the atmosphere is considered more important than what is on the plate .
and with the food trade conditioning german consumers to pay discount prices , rock-bottom cost instead of quality has become the first priority .
these trends are hard to reverse , because they have been entrenched over decades .
these days , chefs are seen as artists .
catalan chef ferran adria was invited to documenta 12 .
other famous chefs have their own tv shows and thousands of viewers watch their live performances .
has cooking become an art because it no longer takes place at home ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer is one of germany 's most famous tv cooks television can provide pseudo-satisfaction when it addresses issues neglected in people 's private lives .
the more passive germans become , the higher the ratings of sports shows .
the same applies to cooking shows , which elevate cooking to fine art at the same time as entertaining .
tv chefs demonstrate how cooking can be an event , rather than a necessity .
this distinction is also apparent in the home .
the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .
event cooking is communicative , basic cooking is just hard work .
cooking shows are hugely successful these days .
but it seems that the better tv cooking gets , the worse people eat .
how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "
meat scandals are popular media stories which ultimately leave consumers scared , even though the media usually fails to assess the risk objectively .
on the other hand , the media use the topic of food less in an advisory role but rather as entertainment - the presentation of the recipes makes it hard to actually cook them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the supermarket 's " homemade " aisle the advertising industry has long been instrumentalizing food .
barely any meals are produced in german kitchens that do n't feature convenience products .
consumers are no longer even aware of how many convenience foods they are using , and surveys show that in fact , the majority of people say they do n't like them .
the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "
over 90 percent of people use a packet or a powder to make what they call a " homemade " sauce .
standardized products lead to standardized tastes .
children who are brought up on long-life milk do n't like fresh milk .
the same goes for strawberry yoghurts with flavor enhancers .
we 're losing regional tastes , because the products people buy can be bought everywhere .
surveys show that viewers enjoy cooking shows .
do you think they have psychological benefits ?
audiences definitely love cooking shows .
the chefs demonstrate what 's possible to do in the kitchen .
but they have a circus appeal , they 're good entertainment .
now and then the viewer might think they could cook something similar , but then they forget all about it .
but cooking shows put the focus on what 's missing from many german kitchens .
they beam into the living room an ideal of sensory pleasure , albeit one than can only be enjoyed visually , rather than by our senses of taste and smell .
i can not judge whether a wonderful meal enjoyed only visually is positive for the psyche .
i personally like to eat what i cook . what does the future hold ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children know what is healthy , whether they choose to eat it is another matter the problem is two-fold .
on the one hand , bad nutrition is fast becoming a serious health risk .
the majority of germans are overweight and there is no end in sight to this trend .
secondly , eating as a key part of our standard of living is increasingly out-of-house .
standardized meals , the disintegration of the shared meal tradition , worsening cooking skills are just some of the issues .
it is hard to understand why a society in which everything is so regimented ignores the issue of food .
kindergartens , schools , offices , hospitals and retirements homes can offer whatever food they want , so long as they meet hygiene requirements .
children would be given a better basis for later eating patterns were they to be taught cooking at school , were they to take part in trips to farms as a way of developing an emotional relationship to the provenance of food .
eating habits can be altered by experience , not by information . interview : carlos albuquerque send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says that he does not seek independence , but autonomy for his homeland . chinese officials , who had called on germany not to allow the dalai lama to enter the country , also cancelled a high-level meeting with german justice minister brigitte zypries on patent right protection that was meant to take place sunday in munich .

dw-world.de talked to nutritional psychologist volker pudel of göttingen university about the evolving role of food in contemporary society and why germans love cooking shows . dw-world.de : as a nutritional psychologist , what do you make of the changes in eating habits over the last few decades ?
is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .
in recent decades , cooking skills have worsened rapidly .
twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .
according to our calculations , by 2020 no one will be able to roast a beef roulade anymore , because they wo n't know how to do it .
convenience food is filling the gap .
i predict that soon , apartments will no longer necessarily feature kitchens .
a microwave is enough to heat up bought meals .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are rituals that traditionally take place within a community .
what happens to food when these rituals no longer take place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kitchens might soon become historical curiosities we 've already moved away from shared mealtimes .
fast food and eating on the go are gaining ground .
eating behavior has become more flexible and determined by the situations we 're in .
in the process , we 've lost a regular basis for the sort of familial communication that should be taking place at the dinner table .
the shift from private to public eating also means that we lose any emotional attachment to food and its provenance because we 're no longer buying and preparing it .
-lsb- in a restaurant -rsb- the atmosphere is considered more important than what is on the plate .
and with the food trade conditioning german consumers to pay discount prices , rock-bottom cost instead of quality has become the first priority .
these trends are hard to reverse , because they have been entrenched over decades .
these days , chefs are seen as artists .
catalan chef ferran adria was invited to documenta 12 .
other famous chefs have their own tv shows and thousands of viewers watch their live performances .
has cooking become an art because it no longer takes place at home ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer is one of germany 's most famous tv cooks television can provide pseudo-satisfaction when it addresses issues neglected in people 's private lives .
the more passive germans become , the higher the ratings of sports shows .
the same applies to cooking shows , which elevate cooking to fine art at the same time as entertaining .
tv chefs demonstrate how cooking can be an event , rather than a necessity .
this distinction is also apparent in the home .
the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .
event cooking is communicative , basic cooking is just hard work .
cooking shows are hugely successful these days .
but it seems that the better tv cooking gets , the worse people eat .
how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "
meat scandals are popular media stories which ultimately leave consumers scared , even though the media usually fails to assess the risk objectively .
on the other hand , the media use the topic of food less in an advisory role but rather as entertainment - the presentation of the recipes makes it hard to actually cook them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the supermarket 's " homemade " aisle the advertising industry has long been instrumentalizing food .
barely any meals are produced in german kitchens that do n't feature convenience products .
consumers are no longer even aware of how many convenience foods they are using , and surveys show that in fact , the majority of people say they do n't like them .
the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "
over 90 percent of people use a packet or a powder to make what they call a " homemade " sauce .
standardized products lead to standardized tastes .
children who are brought up on long-life milk do n't like fresh milk .
the same goes for strawberry yoghurts with flavor enhancers .
we 're losing regional tastes , because the products people buy can be bought everywhere .
surveys show that viewers enjoy cooking shows .
do you think they have psychological benefits ?
audiences definitely love cooking shows .
the chefs demonstrate what 's possible to do in the kitchen .
but they have a circus appeal , they 're good entertainment .
now and then the viewer might think they could cook something similar , but then they forget all about it .
but cooking shows put the focus on what 's missing from many german kitchens .
they beam into the living room an ideal of sensory pleasure , albeit one than can only be enjoyed visually , rather than by our senses of taste and smell .
i can not judge whether a wonderful meal enjoyed only visually is positive for the psyche .
i personally like to eat what i cook . what does the future hold ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children know what is healthy , whether they choose to eat it is another matter the problem is two-fold .
on the one hand , bad nutrition is fast becoming a serious health risk .
the majority of germans are overweight and there is no end in sight to this trend .
secondly , eating as a key part of our standard of living is increasingly out-of-house .
standardized meals , the disintegration of the shared meal tradition , worsening cooking skills are just some of the issues .
it is hard to understand why a society in which everything is so regimented ignores the issue of food .
kindergartens , schools , offices , hospitals and retirements homes can offer whatever food they want , so long as they meet hygiene requirements .
children would be given a better basis for later eating patterns were they to be taught cooking at school , were they to take part in trips to farms as a way of developing an emotional relationship to the provenance of food .
eating habits can be altered by experience , not by information . interview : carlos albuquerque send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to nutritional psychologist volker pudel of göttingen university about the evolving role of food in contemporary society and why germans love cooking shows . dw-world.de : as a nutritional psychologist , what do you make of the changes in eating habits over the last few decades ?
is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .
in recent decades , cooking skills have worsened rapidly .
twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .
according to our calculations , by 2020 no one will be able to roast a beef roulade anymore , because they wo n't know how to do it .
convenience food is filling the gap .
i predict that soon , apartments will no longer necessarily feature kitchens .
a microwave is enough to heat up bought meals .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are rituals that traditionally take place within a community .
what happens to food when these rituals no longer take place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kitchens might soon become historical curiosities we 've already moved away from shared mealtimes .
fast food and eating on the go are gaining ground .
eating behavior has become more flexible and determined by the situations we 're in .
in the process , we 've lost a regular basis for the sort of familial communication that should be taking place at the dinner table .
the shift from private to public eating also means that we lose any emotional attachment to food and its provenance because we 're no longer buying and preparing it .
-lsb- in a restaurant -rsb- the atmosphere is considered more important than what is on the plate .
and with the food trade conditioning german consumers to pay discount prices , rock-bottom cost instead of quality has become the first priority .
these trends are hard to reverse , because they have been entrenched over decades .
these days , chefs are seen as artists .
catalan chef ferran adria was invited to documenta 12 .
other famous chefs have their own tv shows and thousands of viewers watch their live performances .
has cooking become an art because it no longer takes place at home ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer is one of germany 's most famous tv cooks television can provide pseudo-satisfaction when it addresses issues neglected in people 's private lives .
the more passive germans become , the higher the ratings of sports shows .
the same applies to cooking shows , which elevate cooking to fine art at the same time as entertaining .
tv chefs demonstrate how cooking can be an event , rather than a necessity .
this distinction is also apparent in the home .
the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .
event cooking is communicative , basic cooking is just hard work .
cooking shows are hugely successful these days .
but it seems that the better tv cooking gets , the worse people eat .
how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "
meat scandals are popular media stories which ultimately leave consumers scared , even though the media usually fails to assess the risk objectively .
on the other hand , the media use the topic of food less in an advisory role but rather as entertainment - the presentation of the recipes makes it hard to actually cook them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the supermarket 's " homemade " aisle the advertising industry has long been instrumentalizing food .
barely any meals are produced in german kitchens that do n't feature convenience products .
consumers are no longer even aware of how many convenience foods they are using , and surveys show that in fact , the majority of people say they do n't like them .
the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "
over 90 percent of people use a packet or a powder to make what they call a " homemade " sauce .
standardized products lead to standardized tastes .
children who are brought up on long-life milk do n't like fresh milk .
the same goes for strawberry yoghurts with flavor enhancers .
we 're losing regional tastes , because the products people buy can be bought everywhere .
surveys show that viewers enjoy cooking shows .
do you think they have psychological benefits ?
audiences definitely love cooking shows .
the chefs demonstrate what 's possible to do in the kitchen .
but they have a circus appeal , they 're good entertainment .
now and then the viewer might think they could cook something similar , but then they forget all about it .
but cooking shows put the focus on what 's missing from many german kitchens .
they beam into the living room an ideal of sensory pleasure , albeit one than can only be enjoyed visually , rather than by our senses of taste and smell .
i can not judge whether a wonderful meal enjoyed only visually is positive for the psyche .
i personally like to eat what i cook . what does the future hold ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children know what is healthy , whether they choose to eat it is another matter the problem is two-fold .
on the one hand , bad nutrition is fast becoming a serious health risk .
the majority of germans are overweight and there is no end in sight to this trend .
secondly , eating as a key part of our standard of living is increasingly out-of-house .
standardized meals , the disintegration of the shared meal tradition , worsening cooking skills are just some of the issues .
it is hard to understand why a society in which everything is so regimented ignores the issue of food .
kindergartens , schools , offices , hospitals and retirements homes can offer whatever food they want , so long as they meet hygiene requirements .
children would be given a better basis for later eating patterns were they to be taught cooking at school , were they to take part in trips to farms as a way of developing an emotional relationship to the provenance of food .
eating habits can be altered by experience , not by information . interview : carlos albuquerque send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to nutritional psychologist volker pudel of göttingen university about the evolving role of food in contemporary society and why germans love cooking shows . dw-world.de : as a nutritional psychologist , what do you make of the changes in eating habits over the last few decades ?
is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .
in recent decades , cooking skills have worsened rapidly .
twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .
according to our calculations , by 2020 no one will be able to roast a beef roulade anymore , because they wo n't know how to do it .
convenience food is filling the gap .
i predict that soon , apartments will no longer necessarily feature kitchens .
a microwave is enough to heat up bought meals .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are rituals that traditionally take place within a community .
what happens to food when these rituals no longer take place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kitchens might soon become historical curiosities we 've already moved away from shared mealtimes .
fast food and eating on the go are gaining ground .
eating behavior has become more flexible and determined by the situations we 're in .
in the process , we 've lost a regular basis for the sort of familial communication that should be taking place at the dinner table .
the shift from private to public eating also means that we lose any emotional attachment to food and its provenance because we 're no longer buying and preparing it .
-lsb- in a restaurant -rsb- the atmosphere is considered more important than what is on the plate .
and with the food trade conditioning german consumers to pay discount prices , rock-bottom cost instead of quality has become the first priority .
these trends are hard to reverse , because they have been entrenched over decades .
these days , chefs are seen as artists .
catalan chef ferran adria was invited to documenta 12 .
other famous chefs have their own tv shows and thousands of viewers watch their live performances .
has cooking become an art because it no longer takes place at home ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer is one of germany 's most famous tv cooks television can provide pseudo-satisfaction when it addresses issues neglected in people 's private lives .
the more passive germans become , the higher the ratings of sports shows .
the same applies to cooking shows , which elevate cooking to fine art at the same time as entertaining .
tv chefs demonstrate how cooking can be an event , rather than a necessity .
this distinction is also apparent in the home .
the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .
event cooking is communicative , basic cooking is just hard work .
cooking shows are hugely successful these days .
but it seems that the better tv cooking gets , the worse people eat .
how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "
meat scandals are popular media stories which ultimately leave consumers scared , even though the media usually fails to assess the risk objectively .
on the other hand , the media use the topic of food less in an advisory role but rather as entertainment - the presentation of the recipes makes it hard to actually cook them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the supermarket 's " homemade " aisle the advertising industry has long been instrumentalizing food .
barely any meals are produced in german kitchens that do n't feature convenience products .
consumers are no longer even aware of how many convenience foods they are using , and surveys show that in fact , the majority of people say they do n't like them .
the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "
over 90 percent of people use a packet or a powder to make what they call a " homemade " sauce .
standardized products lead to standardized tastes .
children who are brought up on long-life milk do n't like fresh milk .
the same goes for strawberry yoghurts with flavor enhancers .
we 're losing regional tastes , because the products people buy can be bought everywhere .
surveys show that viewers enjoy cooking shows .
do you think they have psychological benefits ?
audiences definitely love cooking shows .
the chefs demonstrate what 's possible to do in the kitchen .
but they have a circus appeal , they 're good entertainment .
now and then the viewer might think they could cook something similar , but then they forget all about it .
but cooking shows put the focus on what 's missing from many german kitchens .
they beam into the living room an ideal of sensory pleasure , albeit one than can only be enjoyed visually , rather than by our senses of taste and smell .
i can not judge whether a wonderful meal enjoyed only visually is positive for the psyche .
i personally like to eat what i cook . what does the future hold ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children know what is healthy , whether they choose to eat it is another matter the problem is two-fold .
on the one hand , bad nutrition is fast becoming a serious health risk .
the majority of germans are overweight and there is no end in sight to this trend .
secondly , eating as a key part of our standard of living is increasingly out-of-house .
standardized meals , the disintegration of the shared meal tradition , worsening cooking skills are just some of the issues .
it is hard to understand why a society in which everything is so regimented ignores the issue of food .
kindergartens , schools , offices , hospitals and retirements homes can offer whatever food they want , so long as they meet hygiene requirements .
children would be given a better basis for later eating patterns were they to be taught cooking at school , were they to take part in trips to farms as a way of developing an emotional relationship to the provenance of food .
eating habits can be altered by experience , not by information . interview : carlos albuquerque send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the historic encounter - the first of its kind - drew fierce criticism from chinese officials . according to german news agency dpa , chinese officials - unlike in the past - are not censoring insulting internet postings directed against merkel that refer to the chancellor as a " witch " and say that she 's " playing with fire . " beijing accuses the dalai lama of promoting independence for tibet , which chinese soldiers occupied in 1950 .
the dalai lama has led a tibetan government-in-exile in india since 1959 .
he says that he does not seek independence , but autonomy for his homeland . chinese officials , who had called on germany not to allow the dalai lama to enter the country , also cancelled a high-level meeting with german justice minister brigitte zypries on patent right protection that was meant to take place sunday in munich .
" technical reasons " were the official explanation for the cancellation , according to a justice ministry spokesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing in august merkel had been under pressure for days to cancel the meeting that government officials describe as a " private exchange of ideas . "
foreign ministry officials reportedly urged merkel to cancel the visit to avoid any damage to sino-german relations . but government spokesman thomas steg said that it should be seen as part of a series of meetings between the chancellor and global religious leaders .

23 .
the historic encounter - the first of its kind - drew fierce criticism from chinese officials . according to german news agency dpa , chinese officials - unlike in the past - are not censoring insulting internet postings directed against merkel that refer to the chancellor as a " witch " and say that she 's " playing with fire . " beijing accuses the dalai lama of promoting independence for tibet , which chinese soldiers occupied in 1950 .
the dalai lama has led a tibetan government-in-exile in india since 1959 .
he says that he does not seek independence , but autonomy for his homeland . chinese officials , who had called on germany not to allow the dalai lama to enter the country , also cancelled a high-level meeting with german justice minister brigitte zypries on patent right protection that was meant to take place sunday in munich .
" technical reasons " were the official explanation for the cancellation , according to a justice ministry spokesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing in august merkel had been under pressure for days to cancel the meeting that government officials describe as a " private exchange of ideas . "
foreign ministry officials reportedly urged merkel to cancel the visit to avoid any damage to sino-german relations . but government spokesman thomas steg said that it should be seen as part of a series of meetings between the chancellor and global religious leaders . " the meeting will take place , the invitation stands , and the chancellor also extended the invitation very consciously , " he said on friday , adding that the government was convinced that the encounter " will not disturb the good state of german-chinese relations and cooperation . " support for chancellor across political spectrum hesse premier roland koch , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union and a long-time supporter of the dalai lama , said sunday that he was glad that merkel did not give in to chinese pressure . " we germans can be happy and proud that human rights issues mean so much to angela merkel and that she talks straight and acts accordingly , " koch , who accompanied the dalai lama to the chancellery , told bild am sonntag tabloid . claudia roth , the leader of the opposition greens party , also backed merkel , saying that the chancellor acted responsibly by meeting with the dalai lama .
in an interview with german public radio deutschlandfunk , roth , the human rights commissioner under the previous red-green coalition government , said that human rights in tibet were in germany 's interest . dalai lama : china displays " arrogance of power " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama presented merkel with his signature gift - a white scarf in an interview with süddeutsche zeitung published saturday , the dalai lama said that he did n't think the meeting would have a lasting negative effect on relations between the two countries . " it is simply china 's attitude , " he said .
" it is the arrogance of power .
beijing is meddling in the domestic affairs of germany and demanding that the german chancellor should not see me … wherever i go , china protests .
the chinese are simply testing how far they can go . " merkel and the dalai lama posed for photographs following their meeting at the chancellery , but did not make any statements to the press .
as he was leaving the chancellery , the dalai lama said that merkel had " kept old friendships , so -lsb- i 'm -rsb- very happy , " according to news reports . merkel sets precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush has met the tibetan spiritual leader on several occasions it was the first time the dalai lama visited the german chancellery as none of merkel 's predecessors received him . the tibetan leader , who won the nobel peace prize in 1989 , has met with other high-ranking german officials in the past , including former president richard von weizsäcker and former foreign ministers joschka fischer and klaus kinkel . the latter 's refusal to accept a white scarf - the dalai lama 's signature gift as a sign of peace - made headlines at the time . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to nutritional psychologist volker pudel of göttingen university about the evolving role of food in contemporary society and why germans love cooking shows . dw-world.de : as a nutritional psychologist , what do you make of the changes in eating habits over the last few decades ?
is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .
in recent decades , cooking skills have worsened rapidly .
twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .
according to our calculations , by 2020 no one will be able to roast a beef roulade anymore , because they wo n't know how to do it .
convenience food is filling the gap .
i predict that soon , apartments will no longer necessarily feature kitchens .
a microwave is enough to heat up bought meals .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are rituals that traditionally take place within a community .
what happens to food when these rituals no longer take place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kitchens might soon become historical curiosities we 've already moved away from shared mealtimes .
fast food and eating on the go are gaining ground .
eating behavior has become more flexible and determined by the situations we 're in .
in the process , we 've lost a regular basis for the sort of familial communication that should be taking place at the dinner table .
the shift from private to public eating also means that we lose any emotional attachment to food and its provenance because we 're no longer buying and preparing it .
-lsb- in a restaurant -rsb- the atmosphere is considered more important than what is on the plate .
and with the food trade conditioning german consumers to pay discount prices , rock-bottom cost instead of quality has become the first priority .
these trends are hard to reverse , because they have been entrenched over decades .
these days , chefs are seen as artists .
catalan chef ferran adria was invited to documenta 12 .
other famous chefs have their own tv shows and thousands of viewers watch their live performances .
has cooking become an art because it no longer takes place at home ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer is one of germany 's most famous tv cooks television can provide pseudo-satisfaction when it addresses issues neglected in people 's private lives .
the more passive germans become , the higher the ratings of sports shows .
the same applies to cooking shows , which elevate cooking to fine art at the same time as entertaining .
tv chefs demonstrate how cooking can be an event , rather than a necessity .
this distinction is also apparent in the home .
the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .
event cooking is communicative , basic cooking is just hard work .
cooking shows are hugely successful these days .
but it seems that the better tv cooking gets , the worse people eat .
how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "
meat scandals are popular media stories which ultimately leave consumers scared , even though the media usually fails to assess the risk objectively .
on the other hand , the media use the topic of food less in an advisory role but rather as entertainment - the presentation of the recipes makes it hard to actually cook them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the supermarket 's " homemade " aisle the advertising industry has long been instrumentalizing food .
barely any meals are produced in german kitchens that do n't feature convenience products .
consumers are no longer even aware of how many convenience foods they are using , and surveys show that in fact , the majority of people say they do n't like them .
the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "
over 90 percent of people use a packet or a powder to make what they call a " homemade " sauce .
standardized products lead to standardized tastes .
children who are brought up on long-life milk do n't like fresh milk .
the same goes for strawberry yoghurts with flavor enhancers .
we 're losing regional tastes , because the products people buy can be bought everywhere .
surveys show that viewers enjoy cooking shows .
do you think they have psychological benefits ?
audiences definitely love cooking shows .
the chefs demonstrate what 's possible to do in the kitchen .
but they have a circus appeal , they 're good entertainment .
now and then the viewer might think they could cook something similar , but then they forget all about it .
but cooking shows put the focus on what 's missing from many german kitchens .
they beam into the living room an ideal of sensory pleasure , albeit one than can only be enjoyed visually , rather than by our senses of taste and smell .
i can not judge whether a wonderful meal enjoyed only visually is positive for the psyche .
i personally like to eat what i cook . what does the future hold ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children know what is healthy , whether they choose to eat it is another matter the problem is two-fold .
on the one hand , bad nutrition is fast becoming a serious health risk .
the majority of germans are overweight and there is no end in sight to this trend .
secondly , eating as a key part of our standard of living is increasingly out-of-house .
standardized meals , the disintegration of the shared meal tradition , worsening cooking skills are just some of the issues .
it is hard to understand why a society in which everything is so regimented ignores the issue of food .
kindergartens , schools , offices , hospitals and retirements homes can offer whatever food they want , so long as they meet hygiene requirements .
children would be given a better basis for later eating patterns were they to be taught cooking at school , were they to take part in trips to farms as a way of developing an emotional relationship to the provenance of food .

the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .

how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "

the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "

is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .

twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 23.09.2007 merkel meets dalai lama despite chinese criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's aides had advised her not to receive the dalai lama german chancellor angela merkel met with the dalai lama on sunday , sept .
23 .
the historic encounter - the first of its kind - drew fierce criticism from chinese officials . according to german news agency dpa , chinese officials - unlike in the past - are not censoring insulting internet postings directed against merkel that refer to the chancellor as a " witch " and say that she 's " playing with fire . " beijing accuses the dalai lama of promoting independence for tibet , which chinese soldiers occupied in 1950 .
the dalai lama has led a tibetan government-in-exile in india since 1959 .
he says that he does not seek independence , but autonomy for his homeland . chinese officials , who had called on germany not to allow the dalai lama to enter the country , also cancelled a high-level meeting with german justice minister brigitte zypries on patent right protection that was meant to take place sunday in munich .
" technical reasons " were the official explanation for the cancellation , according to a justice ministry spokesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing in august merkel had been under pressure for days to cancel the meeting that government officials describe as a " private exchange of ideas . "
foreign ministry officials reportedly urged merkel to cancel the visit to avoid any damage to sino-german relations . but government spokesman thomas steg said that it should be seen as part of a series of meetings between the chancellor and global religious leaders . " the meeting will take place , the invitation stands , and the chancellor also extended the invitation very consciously , " he said on friday , adding that the government was convinced that the encounter " will not disturb the good state of german-chinese relations and cooperation . " support for chancellor across political spectrum hesse premier roland koch , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union and a long-time supporter of the dalai lama , said sunday that he was glad that merkel did not give in to chinese pressure . " we germans can be happy and proud that human rights issues mean so much to angela merkel and that she talks straight and acts accordingly , " koch , who accompanied the dalai lama to the chancellery , told bild am sonntag tabloid . claudia roth , the leader of the opposition greens party , also backed merkel , saying that the chancellor acted responsibly by meeting with the dalai lama .
in an interview with german public radio deutschlandfunk , roth , the human rights commissioner under the previous red-green coalition government , said that human rights in tibet were in germany 's interest . dalai lama : china displays " arrogance of power " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama presented merkel with his signature gift - a white scarf in an interview with süddeutsche zeitung published saturday , the dalai lama said that he did n't think the meeting would have a lasting negative effect on relations between the two countries . " it is simply china 's attitude , " he said .
" it is the arrogance of power .

dw-world.de talked to nutritional psychologist volker pudel of göttingen university about the evolving role of food in contemporary society and why germans love cooking shows . dw-world.de : as a nutritional psychologist , what do you make of the changes in eating habits over the last few decades ?
is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .
in recent decades , cooking skills have worsened rapidly .
twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .
according to our calculations , by 2020 no one will be able to roast a beef roulade anymore , because they wo n't know how to do it .
convenience food is filling the gap .
i predict that soon , apartments will no longer necessarily feature kitchens .
a microwave is enough to heat up bought meals .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are rituals that traditionally take place within a community .
what happens to food when these rituals no longer take place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kitchens might soon become historical curiosities we 've already moved away from shared mealtimes .
fast food and eating on the go are gaining ground .
eating behavior has become more flexible and determined by the situations we 're in .
in the process , we 've lost a regular basis for the sort of familial communication that should be taking place at the dinner table .
the shift from private to public eating also means that we lose any emotional attachment to food and its provenance because we 're no longer buying and preparing it .
-lsb- in a restaurant -rsb- the atmosphere is considered more important than what is on the plate .
and with the food trade conditioning german consumers to pay discount prices , rock-bottom cost instead of quality has become the first priority .
these trends are hard to reverse , because they have been entrenched over decades .
these days , chefs are seen as artists .
catalan chef ferran adria was invited to documenta 12 .
other famous chefs have their own tv shows and thousands of viewers watch their live performances .
has cooking become an art because it no longer takes place at home ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer is one of germany 's most famous tv cooks television can provide pseudo-satisfaction when it addresses issues neglected in people 's private lives .
the more passive germans become , the higher the ratings of sports shows .
the same applies to cooking shows , which elevate cooking to fine art at the same time as entertaining .
tv chefs demonstrate how cooking can be an event , rather than a necessity .
this distinction is also apparent in the home .
the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .
event cooking is communicative , basic cooking is just hard work .
cooking shows are hugely successful these days .
but it seems that the better tv cooking gets , the worse people eat .
how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "
meat scandals are popular media stories which ultimately leave consumers scared , even though the media usually fails to assess the risk objectively .
on the other hand , the media use the topic of food less in an advisory role but rather as entertainment - the presentation of the recipes makes it hard to actually cook them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the supermarket 's " homemade " aisle the advertising industry has long been instrumentalizing food .
barely any meals are produced in german kitchens that do n't feature convenience products .
consumers are no longer even aware of how many convenience foods they are using , and surveys show that in fact , the majority of people say they do n't like them .
the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "
over 90 percent of people use a packet or a powder to make what they call a " homemade " sauce .
standardized products lead to standardized tastes .
children who are brought up on long-life milk do n't like fresh milk .
the same goes for strawberry yoghurts with flavor enhancers .
we 're losing regional tastes , because the products people buy can be bought everywhere .
surveys show that viewers enjoy cooking shows .
do you think they have psychological benefits ?
audiences definitely love cooking shows .
the chefs demonstrate what 's possible to do in the kitchen .
but they have a circus appeal , they 're good entertainment .
now and then the viewer might think they could cook something similar , but then they forget all about it .
but cooking shows put the focus on what 's missing from many german kitchens .
they beam into the living room an ideal of sensory pleasure , albeit one than can only be enjoyed visually , rather than by our senses of taste and smell .
i can not judge whether a wonderful meal enjoyed only visually is positive for the psyche .
i personally like to eat what i cook . what does the future hold ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children know what is healthy , whether they choose to eat it is another matter the problem is two-fold .
on the one hand , bad nutrition is fast becoming a serious health risk .
the majority of germans are overweight and there is no end in sight to this trend .
secondly , eating as a key part of our standard of living is increasingly out-of-house .
standardized meals , the disintegration of the shared meal tradition , worsening cooking skills are just some of the issues .
it is hard to understand why a society in which everything is so regimented ignores the issue of food .
kindergartens , schools , offices , hospitals and retirements homes can offer whatever food they want , so long as they meet hygiene requirements .
children would be given a better basis for later eating patterns were they to be taught cooking at school , were they to take part in trips to farms as a way of developing an emotional relationship to the provenance of food .
eating habits can be altered by experience , not by information . interview : carlos albuquerque send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to nutritional psychologist volker pudel of göttingen university about the evolving role of food in contemporary society and why germans love cooking shows . dw-world.de : as a nutritional psychologist , what do you make of the changes in eating habits over the last few decades ?
is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .
in recent decades , cooking skills have worsened rapidly .
twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .
according to our calculations , by 2020 no one will be able to roast a beef roulade anymore , because they wo n't know how to do it .
convenience food is filling the gap .
i predict that soon , apartments will no longer necessarily feature kitchens .
a microwave is enough to heat up bought meals .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are rituals that traditionally take place within a community .
what happens to food when these rituals no longer take place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kitchens might soon become historical curiosities we 've already moved away from shared mealtimes .
fast food and eating on the go are gaining ground .
eating behavior has become more flexible and determined by the situations we 're in .
in the process , we 've lost a regular basis for the sort of familial communication that should be taking place at the dinner table .
the shift from private to public eating also means that we lose any emotional attachment to food and its provenance because we 're no longer buying and preparing it .
-lsb- in a restaurant -rsb- the atmosphere is considered more important than what is on the plate .
and with the food trade conditioning german consumers to pay discount prices , rock-bottom cost instead of quality has become the first priority .
these trends are hard to reverse , because they have been entrenched over decades .
these days , chefs are seen as artists .
catalan chef ferran adria was invited to documenta 12 .
other famous chefs have their own tv shows and thousands of viewers watch their live performances .
has cooking become an art because it no longer takes place at home ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer is one of germany 's most famous tv cooks television can provide pseudo-satisfaction when it addresses issues neglected in people 's private lives .
the more passive germans become , the higher the ratings of sports shows .
the same applies to cooking shows , which elevate cooking to fine art at the same time as entertaining .
tv chefs demonstrate how cooking can be an event , rather than a necessity .
this distinction is also apparent in the home .
the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .
event cooking is communicative , basic cooking is just hard work .
cooking shows are hugely successful these days .
but it seems that the better tv cooking gets , the worse people eat .
how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "
meat scandals are popular media stories which ultimately leave consumers scared , even though the media usually fails to assess the risk objectively .
on the other hand , the media use the topic of food less in an advisory role but rather as entertainment - the presentation of the recipes makes it hard to actually cook them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the supermarket 's " homemade " aisle the advertising industry has long been instrumentalizing food .
barely any meals are produced in german kitchens that do n't feature convenience products .
consumers are no longer even aware of how many convenience foods they are using , and surveys show that in fact , the majority of people say they do n't like them .
the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "
over 90 percent of people use a packet or a powder to make what they call a " homemade " sauce .
standardized products lead to standardized tastes .
children who are brought up on long-life milk do n't like fresh milk .
the same goes for strawberry yoghurts with flavor enhancers .
we 're losing regional tastes , because the products people buy can be bought everywhere .
surveys show that viewers enjoy cooking shows .
do you think they have psychological benefits ?
audiences definitely love cooking shows .
the chefs demonstrate what 's possible to do in the kitchen .
but they have a circus appeal , they 're good entertainment .
now and then the viewer might think they could cook something similar , but then they forget all about it .
but cooking shows put the focus on what 's missing from many german kitchens .
they beam into the living room an ideal of sensory pleasure , albeit one than can only be enjoyed visually , rather than by our senses of taste and smell .
i can not judge whether a wonderful meal enjoyed only visually is positive for the psyche .
i personally like to eat what i cook . what does the future hold ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children know what is healthy , whether they choose to eat it is another matter the problem is two-fold .
on the one hand , bad nutrition is fast becoming a serious health risk .
the majority of germans are overweight and there is no end in sight to this trend .
secondly , eating as a key part of our standard of living is increasingly out-of-house .
standardized meals , the disintegration of the shared meal tradition , worsening cooking skills are just some of the issues .
it is hard to understand why a society in which everything is so regimented ignores the issue of food .
kindergartens , schools , offices , hospitals and retirements homes can offer whatever food they want , so long as they meet hygiene requirements .
children would be given a better basis for later eating patterns were they to be taught cooking at school , were they to take part in trips to farms as a way of developing an emotional relationship to the provenance of food .
eating habits can be altered by experience , not by information . interview : carlos albuquerque send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to nutritional psychologist volker pudel of göttingen university about the evolving role of food in contemporary society and why germans love cooking shows . dw-world.de : as a nutritional psychologist , what do you make of the changes in eating habits over the last few decades ?
is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .
in recent decades , cooking skills have worsened rapidly .
twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .
according to our calculations , by 2020 no one will be able to roast a beef roulade anymore , because they wo n't know how to do it .
convenience food is filling the gap .
i predict that soon , apartments will no longer necessarily feature kitchens .
a microwave is enough to heat up bought meals .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are rituals that traditionally take place within a community .
what happens to food when these rituals no longer take place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kitchens might soon become historical curiosities we 've already moved away from shared mealtimes .
fast food and eating on the go are gaining ground .
eating behavior has become more flexible and determined by the situations we 're in .
in the process , we 've lost a regular basis for the sort of familial communication that should be taking place at the dinner table .
the shift from private to public eating also means that we lose any emotional attachment to food and its provenance because we 're no longer buying and preparing it .
-lsb- in a restaurant -rsb- the atmosphere is considered more important than what is on the plate .
and with the food trade conditioning german consumers to pay discount prices , rock-bottom cost instead of quality has become the first priority .
these trends are hard to reverse , because they have been entrenched over decades .
these days , chefs are seen as artists .
catalan chef ferran adria was invited to documenta 12 .
other famous chefs have their own tv shows and thousands of viewers watch their live performances .
has cooking become an art because it no longer takes place at home ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer is one of germany 's most famous tv cooks television can provide pseudo-satisfaction when it addresses issues neglected in people 's private lives .
the more passive germans become , the higher the ratings of sports shows .
the same applies to cooking shows , which elevate cooking to fine art at the same time as entertaining .
tv chefs demonstrate how cooking can be an event , rather than a necessity .
this distinction is also apparent in the home .
the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .
event cooking is communicative , basic cooking is just hard work .
cooking shows are hugely successful these days .
but it seems that the better tv cooking gets , the worse people eat .
how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "
meat scandals are popular media stories which ultimately leave consumers scared , even though the media usually fails to assess the risk objectively .
on the other hand , the media use the topic of food less in an advisory role but rather as entertainment - the presentation of the recipes makes it hard to actually cook them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the supermarket 's " homemade " aisle the advertising industry has long been instrumentalizing food .
barely any meals are produced in german kitchens that do n't feature convenience products .
consumers are no longer even aware of how many convenience foods they are using , and surveys show that in fact , the majority of people say they do n't like them .
the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "
over 90 percent of people use a packet or a powder to make what they call a " homemade " sauce .
standardized products lead to standardized tastes .
children who are brought up on long-life milk do n't like fresh milk .
the same goes for strawberry yoghurts with flavor enhancers .
we 're losing regional tastes , because the products people buy can be bought everywhere .
surveys show that viewers enjoy cooking shows .
do you think they have psychological benefits ?
audiences definitely love cooking shows .
the chefs demonstrate what 's possible to do in the kitchen .
but they have a circus appeal , they 're good entertainment .
now and then the viewer might think they could cook something similar , but then they forget all about it .
but cooking shows put the focus on what 's missing from many german kitchens .
they beam into the living room an ideal of sensory pleasure , albeit one than can only be enjoyed visually , rather than by our senses of taste and smell .
i can not judge whether a wonderful meal enjoyed only visually is positive for the psyche .
i personally like to eat what i cook . what does the future hold ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children know what is healthy , whether they choose to eat it is another matter the problem is two-fold .
on the one hand , bad nutrition is fast becoming a serious health risk .
the majority of germans are overweight and there is no end in sight to this trend .
secondly , eating as a key part of our standard of living is increasingly out-of-house .
standardized meals , the disintegration of the shared meal tradition , worsening cooking skills are just some of the issues .
it is hard to understand why a society in which everything is so regimented ignores the issue of food .
kindergartens , schools , offices , hospitals and retirements homes can offer whatever food they want , so long as they meet hygiene requirements .
children would be given a better basis for later eating patterns were they to be taught cooking at school , were they to take part in trips to farms as a way of developing an emotional relationship to the provenance of food .

dw-world.de talked to nutritional psychologist volker pudel of göttingen university about the evolving role of food in contemporary society and why germans love cooking shows . dw-world.de : as a nutritional psychologist , what do you make of the changes in eating habits over the last few decades ?
is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .
in recent decades , cooking skills have worsened rapidly .
twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .
according to our calculations , by 2020 no one will be able to roast a beef roulade anymore , because they wo n't know how to do it .
convenience food is filling the gap .
i predict that soon , apartments will no longer necessarily feature kitchens .
a microwave is enough to heat up bought meals .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are rituals that traditionally take place within a community .
what happens to food when these rituals no longer take place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kitchens might soon become historical curiosities we 've already moved away from shared mealtimes .
fast food and eating on the go are gaining ground .
eating behavior has become more flexible and determined by the situations we 're in .
in the process , we 've lost a regular basis for the sort of familial communication that should be taking place at the dinner table .
the shift from private to public eating also means that we lose any emotional attachment to food and its provenance because we 're no longer buying and preparing it .
-lsb- in a restaurant -rsb- the atmosphere is considered more important than what is on the plate .
and with the food trade conditioning german consumers to pay discount prices , rock-bottom cost instead of quality has become the first priority .
these trends are hard to reverse , because they have been entrenched over decades .
these days , chefs are seen as artists .
catalan chef ferran adria was invited to documenta 12 .
other famous chefs have their own tv shows and thousands of viewers watch their live performances .
has cooking become an art because it no longer takes place at home ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer is one of germany 's most famous tv cooks television can provide pseudo-satisfaction when it addresses issues neglected in people 's private lives .
the more passive germans become , the higher the ratings of sports shows .
the same applies to cooking shows , which elevate cooking to fine art at the same time as entertaining .
tv chefs demonstrate how cooking can be an event , rather than a necessity .
this distinction is also apparent in the home .
the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .
event cooking is communicative , basic cooking is just hard work .
cooking shows are hugely successful these days .
but it seems that the better tv cooking gets , the worse people eat .
how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "
meat scandals are popular media stories which ultimately leave consumers scared , even though the media usually fails to assess the risk objectively .
on the other hand , the media use the topic of food less in an advisory role but rather as entertainment - the presentation of the recipes makes it hard to actually cook them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the supermarket 's " homemade " aisle the advertising industry has long been instrumentalizing food .
barely any meals are produced in german kitchens that do n't feature convenience products .
consumers are no longer even aware of how many convenience foods they are using , and surveys show that in fact , the majority of people say they do n't like them .
the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "
over 90 percent of people use a packet or a powder to make what they call a " homemade " sauce .
standardized products lead to standardized tastes .
children who are brought up on long-life milk do n't like fresh milk .
the same goes for strawberry yoghurts with flavor enhancers .
we 're losing regional tastes , because the products people buy can be bought everywhere .
surveys show that viewers enjoy cooking shows .
do you think they have psychological benefits ?
audiences definitely love cooking shows .
the chefs demonstrate what 's possible to do in the kitchen .
but they have a circus appeal , they 're good entertainment .
now and then the viewer might think they could cook something similar , but then they forget all about it .
but cooking shows put the focus on what 's missing from many german kitchens .
they beam into the living room an ideal of sensory pleasure , albeit one than can only be enjoyed visually , rather than by our senses of taste and smell .
i can not judge whether a wonderful meal enjoyed only visually is positive for the psyche .
i personally like to eat what i cook . what does the future hold ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children know what is healthy , whether they choose to eat it is another matter the problem is two-fold .
on the one hand , bad nutrition is fast becoming a serious health risk .
the majority of germans are overweight and there is no end in sight to this trend .
secondly , eating as a key part of our standard of living is increasingly out-of-house .
standardized meals , the disintegration of the shared meal tradition , worsening cooking skills are just some of the issues .
it is hard to understand why a society in which everything is so regimented ignores the issue of food .
kindergartens , schools , offices , hospitals and retirements homes can offer whatever food they want , so long as they meet hygiene requirements .
children would be given a better basis for later eating patterns were they to be taught cooking at school , were they to take part in trips to farms as a way of developing an emotional relationship to the provenance of food .
eating habits can be altered by experience , not by information . interview : carlos albuquerque send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to nutritional psychologist volker pudel of göttingen university about the evolving role of food in contemporary society and why germans love cooking shows . dw-world.de : as a nutritional psychologist , what do you make of the changes in eating habits over the last few decades ?
is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .
in recent decades , cooking skills have worsened rapidly .
twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .
according to our calculations , by 2020 no one will be able to roast a beef roulade anymore , because they wo n't know how to do it .
convenience food is filling the gap .
i predict that soon , apartments will no longer necessarily feature kitchens .
a microwave is enough to heat up bought meals .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are rituals that traditionally take place within a community .
what happens to food when these rituals no longer take place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kitchens might soon become historical curiosities we 've already moved away from shared mealtimes .
fast food and eating on the go are gaining ground .
eating behavior has become more flexible and determined by the situations we 're in .
in the process , we 've lost a regular basis for the sort of familial communication that should be taking place at the dinner table .
the shift from private to public eating also means that we lose any emotional attachment to food and its provenance because we 're no longer buying and preparing it .
-lsb- in a restaurant -rsb- the atmosphere is considered more important than what is on the plate .
and with the food trade conditioning german consumers to pay discount prices , rock-bottom cost instead of quality has become the first priority .
these trends are hard to reverse , because they have been entrenched over decades .
these days , chefs are seen as artists .
catalan chef ferran adria was invited to documenta 12 .
other famous chefs have their own tv shows and thousands of viewers watch their live performances .
has cooking become an art because it no longer takes place at home ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer is one of germany 's most famous tv cooks television can provide pseudo-satisfaction when it addresses issues neglected in people 's private lives .
the more passive germans become , the higher the ratings of sports shows .
the same applies to cooking shows , which elevate cooking to fine art at the same time as entertaining .
tv chefs demonstrate how cooking can be an event , rather than a necessity .
this distinction is also apparent in the home .
the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .
event cooking is communicative , basic cooking is just hard work .
cooking shows are hugely successful these days .
but it seems that the better tv cooking gets , the worse people eat .
how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "
meat scandals are popular media stories which ultimately leave consumers scared , even though the media usually fails to assess the risk objectively .
on the other hand , the media use the topic of food less in an advisory role but rather as entertainment - the presentation of the recipes makes it hard to actually cook them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the supermarket 's " homemade " aisle the advertising industry has long been instrumentalizing food .
barely any meals are produced in german kitchens that do n't feature convenience products .
consumers are no longer even aware of how many convenience foods they are using , and surveys show that in fact , the majority of people say they do n't like them .
the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "
over 90 percent of people use a packet or a powder to make what they call a " homemade " sauce .
standardized products lead to standardized tastes .
children who are brought up on long-life milk do n't like fresh milk .
the same goes for strawberry yoghurts with flavor enhancers .
we 're losing regional tastes , because the products people buy can be bought everywhere .
surveys show that viewers enjoy cooking shows .
do you think they have psychological benefits ?
audiences definitely love cooking shows .
the chefs demonstrate what 's possible to do in the kitchen .
but they have a circus appeal , they 're good entertainment .
now and then the viewer might think they could cook something similar , but then they forget all about it .
but cooking shows put the focus on what 's missing from many german kitchens .
they beam into the living room an ideal of sensory pleasure , albeit one than can only be enjoyed visually , rather than by our senses of taste and smell .
i can not judge whether a wonderful meal enjoyed only visually is positive for the psyche .
i personally like to eat what i cook . what does the future hold ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children know what is healthy , whether they choose to eat it is another matter the problem is two-fold .
on the one hand , bad nutrition is fast becoming a serious health risk .
the majority of germans are overweight and there is no end in sight to this trend .
secondly , eating as a key part of our standard of living is increasingly out-of-house .
standardized meals , the disintegration of the shared meal tradition , worsening cooking skills are just some of the issues .
it is hard to understand why a society in which everything is so regimented ignores the issue of food .
kindergartens , schools , offices , hospitals and retirements homes can offer whatever food they want , so long as they meet hygiene requirements .
children would be given a better basis for later eating patterns were they to be taught cooking at school , were they to take part in trips to farms as a way of developing an emotional relationship to the provenance of food .
eating habits can be altered by experience , not by information . interview : carlos albuquerque send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to nutritional psychologist volker pudel of göttingen university about the evolving role of food in contemporary society and why germans love cooking shows . dw-world.de : as a nutritional psychologist , what do you make of the changes in eating habits over the last few decades ?
is there such a thing as a zeitgeist when it comes to nutrition ?
volker pudel : the words " nutrition " and " food " are no longer synonymous .
people used to be satisfied with eating until they were full , but now , they do n't want to feel full .
food has increasingly little to do with its original biological function .
the way people eat is no longer determined by the need for energy and nutrients .
the result is a discrepancy between needs and requirements , and problems that range from malnutrition to overeating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker pudel even increased awareness of healthy eating has not led people to eat the way they should .
they continue to eat the way they always did , but now they eat with a guilty conscience .
increasing awareness of healthy eating was too cognitive and rational , so even though people understood it , they did n't change their behavior . children and young people are getting increasingly fat .
a representative survey of 2,900 german families showed that children and young people have sound judgment when it comes to food .
they know that wholegrain bread is healthy - but they do n't like it .
coke and chocolate is fattening , but they like those things .
eating behavior is emotional behavior , which is why sensible arguments are useless .
in recent decades , cooking skills have worsened rapidly .
twenty-seven percent of men admit they do n't know how to fry an egg .
according to our calculations , by 2020 no one will be able to roast a beef roulade anymore , because they wo n't know how to do it .
convenience food is filling the gap .
i predict that soon , apartments will no longer necessarily feature kitchens .
a microwave is enough to heat up bought meals .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are rituals that traditionally take place within a community .
what happens to food when these rituals no longer take place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kitchens might soon become historical curiosities we 've already moved away from shared mealtimes .
fast food and eating on the go are gaining ground .
eating behavior has become more flexible and determined by the situations we 're in .
in the process , we 've lost a regular basis for the sort of familial communication that should be taking place at the dinner table .
the shift from private to public eating also means that we lose any emotional attachment to food and its provenance because we 're no longer buying and preparing it .
-lsb- in a restaurant -rsb- the atmosphere is considered more important than what is on the plate .
and with the food trade conditioning german consumers to pay discount prices , rock-bottom cost instead of quality has become the first priority .
these trends are hard to reverse , because they have been entrenched over decades .
these days , chefs are seen as artists .
catalan chef ferran adria was invited to documenta 12 .
other famous chefs have their own tv shows and thousands of viewers watch their live performances .
has cooking become an art because it no longer takes place at home ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer is one of germany 's most famous tv cooks television can provide pseudo-satisfaction when it addresses issues neglected in people 's private lives .
the more passive germans become , the higher the ratings of sports shows .
the same applies to cooking shows , which elevate cooking to fine art at the same time as entertaining .
tv chefs demonstrate how cooking can be an event , rather than a necessity .
this distinction is also apparent in the home .
the husband tends to be the event cook , the wife - if she can cook at all - does the basic meals .
event cooking is more like what goes on in the tv studios , with high-end utensils , a glass of good wine and friends helping out .
event cooking is communicative , basic cooking is just hard work .
cooking shows are hugely successful these days .
but it seems that the better tv cooking gets , the worse people eat .
how would you describe the current relationship between nutrition and the media ?
the media manipulate both " nutrition " and " food . "
meat scandals are popular media stories which ultimately leave consumers scared , even though the media usually fails to assess the risk objectively .
on the other hand , the media use the topic of food less in an advisory role but rather as entertainment - the presentation of the recipes makes it hard to actually cook them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the supermarket 's " homemade " aisle the advertising industry has long been instrumentalizing food .
barely any meals are produced in german kitchens that do n't feature convenience products .
consumers are no longer even aware of how many convenience foods they are using , and surveys show that in fact , the majority of people say they do n't like them .
the term " homemade " has been redefined , with 34 percent of people who run a household describing a cake made from cake mix as " homemade . "
over 90 percent of people use a packet or a powder to make what they call a " homemade " sauce .
standardized products lead to standardized tastes .
children who are brought up on long-life milk do n't like fresh milk .
the same goes for strawberry yoghurts with flavor enhancers .
we 're losing regional tastes , because the products people buy can be bought everywhere .
surveys show that viewers enjoy cooking shows .
do you think they have psychological benefits ?
audiences definitely love cooking shows .
the chefs demonstrate what 's possible to do in the kitchen .
but they have a circus appeal , they 're good entertainment .
now and then the viewer might think they could cook something similar , but then they forget all about it .
but cooking shows put the focus on what 's missing from many german kitchens .
they beam into the living room an ideal of sensory pleasure , albeit one than can only be enjoyed visually , rather than by our senses of taste and smell .
i can not judge whether a wonderful meal enjoyed only visually is positive for the psyche .
i personally like to eat what i cook . what does the future hold ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children know what is healthy , whether they choose to eat it is another matter the problem is two-fold .
on the one hand , bad nutrition is fast becoming a serious health risk .
the majority of germans are overweight and there is no end in sight to this trend .
secondly , eating as a key part of our standard of living is increasingly out-of-house .
standardized meals , the disintegration of the shared meal tradition , worsening cooking skills are just some of the issues .
it is hard to understand why a society in which everything is so regimented ignores the issue of food .
kindergartens , schools , offices , hospitals and retirements homes can offer whatever food they want , so long as they meet hygiene requirements .
children would be given a better basis for later eating patterns were they to be taught cooking at school , were they to take part in trips to farms as a way of developing an emotional relationship to the provenance of food .
eating habits can be altered by experience , not by information . interview : carlos albuquerque send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mr fukuda , 71 , who wants closer ties with asian neighbours , defeated hawkish former foreign minister taro aso .
mr abe quit unexpectedly two weeks ago in a move that drew wide criticism .
his resignation followed an embarrassing defeat in japan 's upper house elections in july , and a series of political scandals .
mr fukuda won 330 of the 527 valid votes cast -lrb- 63 % of the ballot -rrb- against 197 for mr aso .
when parliament meets to elect a new prime minister on tuesday , mr fukuda is virtually guaranteed to clinch the job because the party controls the more powerful lower house .
' difficult situation ' the bespectacled vote winner bowed solemnly to the applause of party lawmakers after the result .
" the ldp is facing an extremely difficult situation and i want to work first to revive the party and win back people 's trust , " he said .
key differences fukuda -lrb- right -rrb- : urges co-operation with china and softer line on north korea .

he wants to pursue a more conciliatory approach with japan 's neighbours china and north korea .
he has also said japan 's relationship with the us will continue to be the " cornerstone " of his foreign policy .
and despite growing opposition at home , he plans to continue japan 's logistical support in the war in afghanistan .
a member of the political elite , mr fukuda is the son of a prime minister from the 1970s and was former chief cabinet secretary under mr abe 's predecessor , junichiro koizumi .
the bbc 's chris hogg in tokyo says the ldp 's new president was seen as the safer pair of hands between the two candidates .
after shinzo abe 's messy resignation and gaffe-prone administration , party members are looking for someone who can steady the ship , our correspondent says .
mr fukuda has pledged to trim the mammoth public debt of the world 's second biggest economy .
he has also promised to tackle the growing income gap between poorer rural areas and wealthier urban zones .
his rival , mr aso , 67 , had advocated a tough line towards north korea and rejected changing the law to allow women to ascend the throne .
he also described china 's growing military spend as a threat to japan and the region .
mr abe , 53 , remains in hospital after being admitted with a stress-related stomach complaint a day after his resignation .

there is a mixture between real political protest and social unrest in general pablo halpern , lawyer since the military left office in 1990 , it has had a stable democratic government , the economy is growing , unemployment is down and disputes with its neighbours are being resolved - albeit slowly .
so why all the protests ?
" chile is a very prosperous country if you look at the figures of the economy .
but the life for the people is very hard , " explains one protester .
chile has seen its economy grow year after year , at about 5.5 % per year .
shiny state of the art office blocks are sprouting in the capital , santiago , and the streets are full of new cars .
pablo halpern , a wealthy lawyer , joins me after a day 's skiing in the mountains above santiago .
he believes the protests do not accurately reflect the situation in chile .
" even if the images are sometimes very violent and result in damaging the streets and the windows of the shops - and things like that look very violent - they 're for a very short period and in some narrow areas - downtown , close to the presidential palace , " he explains .
" they start at a certain time and they end at 12 o 'clock that same day .
so it 's really an exercise where there is a mixture between real political protest and social unrest in general . "
widespread discontent the distribution of wealth in chile is one of the worst in the region .
sandro imacache is one of those who feels he is not reaping the benefits of the boom .
the gap between the rich and poor is very strong political analyst claudio fuentes " at the moment the minimum wage is too low , " he says , standing behind the reception desk of the modern apartment block in the plush las condes district of santiago , where he works as a concierge .
that wage is $ 208 -lrb- £ 104 -rrb- per month - though some 15 % of chile 's work force earns less , according to the latest survey of national socioeconomic composition .
" with that i 've got to support a family and pay for the useless transport system that we 've got .
life here in chile is expensive - everything goes up and nothing comes down .
" the transport system is crap and expensive .
it takes me one and a half hours to get to work - with three changes - and that 's without the queues .
" the supermarkets , the hospitals , it 's all going up .
we used to pay 30 to 40 pesos for an onion - and now it 's 150 or 160 - just for one . "
sandro sees the wealth but does not get his hands on much of it .
he can not afford to join the demonstrations , but is part of the growing tide of discontent in chile among people who feel they are being left behind .
sandro imacache says the minimum wage is too low political analyst claudio fuentes says the government is not acting fast enough to rectify the problem .
" chile is one of the three most unequal countries in latin america , " he says .
" i think this problem has been waiting to be resolved for a very long time and i think the gap between the rich and poor is very strong , and i think you can see that in santiago even - if you go to the north and south of santiago you see the differences between the rich and poor .
" and you see that these frustrations of the people have been addressed in the last demonstrations - the students for example who ca n't get into the universities because the quality of the education is n't very good . "
chile is still one of the most prosperous and stable countries in latin america .
but while most chileans are happy with the way things are going , there is also a growing tide of discontent being fed by frustration that the wealth is not being shared by all .
and unless that problem is resolved , sooner rather than later , the demonstrations are only likely to grow - in numbers and intensity .

facing them at the other end are masked demonstrators , their backpacks loaded with stones .
then the stones start flying and the police move in .
the result : 170 arrests and one policeman injured .
just another demonstration in chile .
two days later in a similar protest , a policeman was shot dead , causing outrage and great concern in this otherwise tranquil country .
most march peacefully , but violence also frequently erupts , as it did earlier this month when demonstrators took to the street to mark the military coup on 11 september 1973 , when general augusto pinochet overthrew the elected socialist president , salvador allende .
but if it is not that , it is the transport system , or the crumbling schools or the plummeting popularity of the left-of-centre president , michelle bachelet .
organised chaos chile is the outstanding success story in latin america . "
there is a mixture between real political protest and social unrest in general " pablo halpern , lawyer since the military left office in 1990 , it has had a stable democratic government , the economy is growing , unemployment is down and disputes with its neighbours are being resolved - albeit slowly .
so why all the protests ?
" chile is a very prosperous country if you look at the figures of the economy .
but the life for the people is very hard , " explains one protester .
chile has seen its economy grow year after year , at about 5.5 % per year .
shiny state of the art office blocks are sprouting in the capital , santiago , and the streets are full of new cars .
pablo halpern , a wealthy lawyer , joins me after a day 's skiing in the mountains above santiago .
he believes the protests do not accurately reflect the situation in chile .
" even if the images are sometimes very violent and result in damaging the streets and the windows of the shops - and things like that look very violent - they 're for a very short period and in some narrow areas - downtown , close to the presidential palace , " he explains .
" they start at a certain time and they end at 12 o 'clock that same day .
so it 's really an exercise where there is a mixture between real political protest and social unrest in general . "
widespread discontent the distribution of wealth in chile is one of the worst in the region .
sandro imacache is one of those who feels he is not reaping the benefits of the boom . "
the gap between the rich and poor is very strong " political analyst claudio fuentes " at the moment the minimum wage is too low , " he says , standing behind the reception desk of the modern apartment block in the plush las condes district of santiago , where he works as a concierge .
that wage is $ 208 -lrb- £ 104 -rrb- per month - though some 15 % of chile 's work force earns less , according to the latest survey of national socioeconomic composition .
" with that i 've got to support a family and pay for the useless transport system that we 've got .
life here in chile is expensive - everything goes up and nothing comes down .
" the transport system is crap and expensive .
it takes me one and a half hours to get to work - with three changes - and that 's without the queues .
" the supermarkets , the hospitals , it 's all going up .
we used to pay 30 to 40 pesos for an onion - and now it 's 150 or 160 - just for one . "
sandro sees the wealth but does not get his hands on much of it .
he can not afford to join the demonstrations , but is part of the growing tide of discontent in chile among people who feel they are being left behind .
political analyst claudio fuentes says the government is not acting fast enough to rectify the problem .
" chile is one of the three most unequal countries in latin america , " he says .
" i think this problem has been waiting to be resolved for a very long time and i think the gap between the rich and poor is very strong , and i think you can see that in santiago even - if you go to the north and south of santiago you see the differences between the rich and poor .
" and you see that these frustrations of the people have been addressed in the last demonstrations - the students for example who ca n't get into the universities because the quality of the education is n't very good . "
chile is still one of the most prosperous and stable countries in latin america .
but while most chileans are happy with the way things are going , there is also a growing tide of discontent being fed by frustration that the wealth is not being shared by all .
and unless that problem is resolved , sooner rather than later , the demonstrations are only likely to grow - in numbers and intensity .

the disease is spread by midges .
it is passed from animal to midge , and from midge to animal , but is not transmitted from animal to animal .
stephen rash , suffolk livestock farmer " we knew that it had been travelling through europe for some time .
it 's quite rife now in belgium and the netherlands .
we 'd rather hoped that the channel and the north sea were going to protect us .
on top of foot-and-mouth , it 's another body blow to another already struggling industry . "
peter kendall , national farmers ' union president " it 's something the community has been preparing itself for but it 's a real shock particularly when you consider the plight the industry is currently suffering from .
it would be nice to talk about farming in a positive light rather then always having another disaster story ...
we are hoping a vaccine will be available shortly , probably in the next year or so , so if we can contain it now it need not have an enormous economic impact on uk farming ...
i 'm optimistic this can be quite an isolated localised case and going into winter these midges are n't as active as they would have been if this had happened two or three months ago . "
peter ainsworth , shadow environment secretary " news that bluetongue has reached the uk is another hammer blow for the british farming community .
just as the farming industry seemed to be getting back on its feet , it has been hit by one disaster after another , through no fault of its own .
it is essential that the government takes all sensible measures to deal with this latest affliction .
the protection zone you have to put round a bluetongue site is much bigger than it is for foot-and-mouth and the other bad news is that it lasts much longer .
in a sense there 's some comfort to be had from the fact that the restrictions for foot-and-mouth are already there so we will not get a whole lot of new stuff in terms of regulations and restrictions on movement .
but the existing ones are bad enough and having a big economic impact and bluetongue looks as though it 's going to last even longer . "
david catlow , president of the british veterinary association " there is n't a cure for it , vaccination ultimately is what we would have to do if the disease becomes established in the uk .
the aim with foot-and-mouth is to eradicate it and not have the disease at all .
bluetongue is very different , buckets of disinfectant do not stop bluetongue spreading because it is spread by the biting midge ...
culling is not part of the strategy , it 's not something the public will see in the uk even if the disease becomes widespread ...
at the moment if this becomes established in the uk , as it seems to have become established in northern europe , the only way we will really control it is when we have a vaccination , and that is n't yet available .
we 're possibly a year away before the development of some new , inactivated vaccines that will be the way ultimately to control it .
so at the moment , such a frightening prospect of such a serious disease , but we have no known way of really protecting animals from it . "
prof philip mellor , institute of animal health , pirbright " there are a number of things that happens when you have bluetongue virus in an area and the first one is of course movement of animals because you do n't want infected animals moving out of the infected premises .
the second thing is you can use a whole series of insecticide regimes to try and control the insects .
the insects tend to fly around sunset and sunrise and throughout the night - so if it 's possible the animals can be housed to , again , cut down the number of bites they may receive from potentially infected insects . "
fred landeg , deputy chief vet " it is a disease that can vary in signs : sometimes you see nothing ; sometimes in sheep you get a high temperature , swollen head , difficult breathing , ulcers in the mouth and a nasal discharge .
and in some cases it can cause quite serious mortality or high death in sheep flocks .
in europe , where this virus has been circulating - quite an extensive outbreak this season - there has been significant illness in sheep and cattle and loss of production . "

the disease is spread by midges .
it is passed from animal to midge , and from midge to animal , but is not transmitted from animal to animal .
stephen rash , suffolk livestock farmer we knew that it had been travelling through europe for some time .
it 's quite rife now in belgium and the netherlands .
we 'd rather hoped that the channel and the north sea were going to protect us .
on top of foot-and-mouth , it 's another body blow to another already struggling industry .
peter kendall , national farmers ' union president it 's something the community has been preparing itself for but it 's a real shock particularly when you consider the plight the industry is currently suffering from .
it would be nice to talk about farming in a positive light rather then always having another disaster story ...
we are hoping a vaccine will be available shortly , probably in the next year or so , so if we can contain it now it need not have an enormous economic impact on uk farming ...
i 'm optimistic this can be quite an isolated localised case and going into winter these midges are n't as active as they would have been if this had happened two or three months ago .
peter ainsworth , shadow environment secretary news that bluetongue has reached the uk is another hammer blow for the british farming community .
just as the farming industry seemed to be getting back on its feet , it has been hit by one disaster after another , through no fault of its own .
it is essential that the government takes all sensible measures to deal with this latest affliction .
the protection zone you have to put round a bluetongue site is much bigger than it is for foot-and-mouth and the other bad news is that it lasts much longer .
in a sense there 's some comfort to be had from the fact that the restrictions for foot-and-mouth are already there so we will not get a whole lot of new stuff in terms of regulations and restrictions on movement .
but the existing ones are bad enough and having a big economic impact and bluetongue looks as though it 's going to last even longer .
david catlow , president of the british veterinary association there is n't a cure for it , vaccination ultimately is what we would have to do if the disease becomes established in the uk .
the aim with foot-and-mouth is to eradicate it and not have the disease at all .
bluetongue is very different , buckets of disinfectant do not stop bluetongue spreading because it is spread by the biting midge ...
culling is not part of the strategy , it 's not something the public will see in the uk even if the disease becomes widespread ...
at the moment if this becomes established in the uk , as it seems to have become established in northern europe , the only way we will really control it is when we have a vaccination , and that is n't yet available .
we 're possibly a year away before the development of some new , inactivated vaccines that will be the way ultimately to control it .
so at the moment , such a frightening prospect of such a serious disease , but we have no known way of really protecting animals from it .
prof philip mellor , institute of animal health , pirbright there are a number of things that happens when you have bluetongue virus in an area and the first one is of course movement of animals because you do n't want infected animals moving out of the infected premises .
the second thing is you can use a whole series of insecticide regimes to try and control the insects .
the insects tend to fly around sunset and sunrise and throughout the night - so if it 's possible the animals can be housed to , again , cut down the number of bites they may receive from potentially infected insects .
fred landeg , deputy chief vet it is a disease that can vary in signs : sometimes you see nothing ; sometimes in sheep you get a high temperature , swollen head , difficult breathing , ulcers in the mouth and a nasal discharge .
and in some cases it can cause quite serious mortality or high death in sheep flocks .
in europe , where this virus has been circulating - quite an extensive outbreak this season - there has been significant illness in sheep and cattle and loss of production .

the disease is spread by midges .
it is passed from animal to midge , and from midge to animal , but is not transmitted from animal to animal .
stephen rash , suffolk livestock farmer we knew that it had been travelling through europe for some time .
it 's quite rife now in belgium and the netherlands .
we 'd rather hoped that the channel and the north sea were going to protect us .
on top of foot-and-mouth , it 's another body blow to another already struggling industry .
peter kendall , national farmers ' union president it 's something the community has been preparing itself for but it 's a real shock particularly when you consider the plight the industry is currently suffering from .
it would be nice to talk about farming in a positive light rather then always having another disaster story ...
we are hoping a vaccine will be available shortly , probably in the next year or so , so if we can contain it now it need not have an enormous economic impact on uk farming ...
i 'm optimistic this can be quite an isolated localised case and going into winter these midges are n't as active as they would have been if this had happened two or three months ago .
peter ainsworth , shadow environment secretary news that bluetongue has reached the uk is another hammer blow for the british farming community .
just as the farming industry seemed to be getting back on its feet , it has been hit by one disaster after another , through no fault of its own .
it is essential that the government takes all sensible measures to deal with this latest affliction .
the protection zone you have to put round a bluetongue site is much bigger than it is for foot-and-mouth and the other bad news is that it lasts much longer .
in a sense there 's some comfort to be had from the fact that the restrictions for foot-and-mouth are already there so we will not get a whole lot of new stuff in terms of regulations and restrictions on movement .
but the existing ones are bad enough and having a big economic impact and bluetongue looks as though it 's going to last even longer .
david catlow , president of the british veterinary association there is n't a cure for it , vaccination ultimately is what we would have to do if the disease becomes established in the uk .
the aim with foot-and-mouth is to eradicate it and not have the disease at all .
bluetongue is very different , buckets of disinfectant do not stop bluetongue spreading because it is spread by the biting midge ...
culling is not part of the strategy , it 's not something the public will see in the uk even if the disease becomes widespread ...
at the moment if this becomes established in the uk , as it seems to have become established in northern europe , the only way we will really control it is when we have a vaccination , and that is n't yet available .
we 're possibly a year away before the development of some new , inactivated vaccines that will be the way ultimately to control it .
so at the moment , such a frightening prospect of such a serious disease , but we have no known way of really protecting animals from it .
prof philip mellor , institute of animal health , pirbright there are a number of things that happens when you have bluetongue virus in an area and the first one is of course movement of animals because you do n't want infected animals moving out of the infected premises .
the second thing is you can use a whole series of insecticide regimes to try and control the insects .
the insects tend to fly around sunset and sunrise and throughout the night - so if it 's possible the animals can be housed to , again , cut down the number of bites they may receive from potentially infected insects .
fred landeg , deputy chief vet it is a disease that can vary in signs : sometimes you see nothing ; sometimes in sheep you get a high temperature , swollen head , difficult breathing , ulcers in the mouth and a nasal discharge .
and in some cases it can cause quite serious mortality or high death in sheep flocks .

the insects tend to fly around sunset and sunrise and throughout the night - so if it 's possible the animals can be housed to , again , cut down the number of bites they may receive from potentially infected insects .
fred landeg , deputy chief vet it is a disease that can vary in signs : sometimes you see nothing ; sometimes in sheep you get a high temperature , swollen head , difficult breathing , ulcers in the mouth and a nasal discharge .
and in some cases it can cause quite serious mortality or high death in sheep flocks .
in europe , where this virus has been circulating - quite an extensive outbreak this season - there has been significant illness in sheep and cattle and loss of production .

the disease is spread by midges .
it is passed from animal to midge , and from midge to animal , but is not transmitted from animal to animal .
stephen rash , suffolk livestock farmer we knew that it had been travelling through europe for some time .
it 's quite rife now in belgium and the netherlands .
we 'd rather hoped that the channel and the north sea were going to protect us .
on top of foot-and-mouth , it 's another body blow to another already struggling industry .
peter kendall , national farmers ' union president it 's something the community has been preparing itself for but it 's a real shock particularly when you consider the plight the industry is currently suffering from .
it would be nice to talk about farming in a positive light rather then always having another disaster story ...
we are hoping a vaccine will be available shortly , probably in the next year or so , so if we can contain it now it need not have an enormous economic impact on uk farming ...
i 'm optimistic this can be quite an isolated localised case and going into winter these midges are n't as active as they would have been if this had happened two or three months ago .
peter ainsworth , shadow environment secretary news that bluetongue has reached the uk is another hammer blow for the british farming community .
just as the farming industry seemed to be getting back on its feet , it has been hit by one disaster after another , through no fault of its own .
it is essential that the government takes all sensible measures to deal with this latest affliction .
the protection zone you have to put round a bluetongue site is much bigger than it is for foot-and-mouth and the other bad news is that it lasts much longer .
in a sense there 's some comfort to be had from the fact that the restrictions for foot-and-mouth are already there so we will not get a whole lot of new stuff in terms of regulations and restrictions on movement .
but the existing ones are bad enough and having a big economic impact and bluetongue looks as though it 's going to last even longer .
david catlow , president of the british veterinary association there is n't a cure for it , vaccination ultimately is what we would have to do if the disease becomes established in the uk .
the aim with foot-and-mouth is to eradicate it and not have the disease at all .
bluetongue is very different , buckets of disinfectant do not stop bluetongue spreading because it is spread by the biting midge ...
culling is not part of the strategy , it 's not something the public will see in the uk even if the disease becomes widespread ...
at the moment if this becomes established in the uk , as it seems to have become established in northern europe , the only way we will really control it is when we have a vaccination , and that is n't yet available .
we 're possibly a year away before the development of some new , inactivated vaccines that will be the way ultimately to control it .
so at the moment , such a frightening prospect of such a serious disease , but we have no known way of really protecting animals from it .
prof philip mellor , institute of animal health , pirbright there are a number of things that happens when you have bluetongue virus in an area and the first one is of course movement of animals because you do n't want infected animals moving out of the infected premises .

yasuo fukuda , who is 71 , becomes the president of the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- and is certain to be elected prime minister when parliament meets on tuesday .
he is the oldest japanese prime minister to take office since 1991 .
he replaces japan 's youngest leader in recent history , shinzo abe , who was 53 when he stepped down .
mr abe 's short-lived administration was dogged by mistakes and scandals which many said were largely the result of his inexperience .
mr fukuda , in contrast , is seen by some as a safe pair of hands . "
yasuo fukuda is old but not that experienced " professor koichi nakano sophia university , tokyo he is a former oilman who himself admits he lacks charisma .
" he is often described as boring , " says political analyst tsuneo watanabe , from the centre for strategic and international studies .
" but the other way of looking at that is that he represents stability . "
on the other hand , as professor koichi nakano from tokyo 's sophia university points out , he has only held one cabinet post previously .
he was the longest-serving chief cabinet secretary since the end of world war ii .
but that is not the same as running a big department like the finance ministry or the ministry of foreign affairs .
" he is old but not that experienced , " the professor says .
analysts will be watching the selection of his first cabinet closely , to try to work out whether he will be allowed to lead his party or whether the powerful interest groups , the factions with the ldp , will pull the strings and control him .
that is the way it used to work .
the faction bosses would often formulate policy in the shadows , making backroom deals with each other .
one of mr fukuda 's predecessors , junichiro koizumi , tried to sweep that all away and impose his will on his cabinet .
mr abe did his best to follow that lead .
if ministerial jobs are divided up equally among the eight main factions who have backed mr fukuda , that will look like they are again planning to try to control government policy .
if mr fukuda is given more freedom to appoint who he wants for each job that will signal that he is firmly in control of the agenda .
disgruntled supporters so what will that agenda be ?
he has already made clear that he wants to try to improve relations with north korea .
he is seen as more of a " dove " on foreign policy than the " hawkish " mr abe .
he will be keen to try to improve relations with japan 's neighbours china and south korea .
he will push for an extension of japan 's naval mission in support of us-led forces in afghanistan .
that will not be easy .
the opposition which controls the country 's upper house of parliament has promised to block the legislation necessary to extend the mission .
at home he needs to try to reconnect the ldp with its traditional supporters , particularly those in rural areas who punished the government in the upper house elections in july .
many in the countryside complain they have suffered as a result of the country 's economic reforms .
mr fukuda will have to decide whether to increase public spending in those areas , difficult when the country 's huge public debt is the equivalent of one and a half times japan 's gdp .
he will also face calls for a general election , to give him a mandate to govern .
that is a gamble .
the ldp currently has a huge majority in the country 's lower house of parliament .
there does not need to be an election until 2009 .
but now the opposition controls the upper house they will be able to block , or at the very least slow down or frustrate the government 's legislative agenda .
mr fukuda may feel he has no alternative but to seek the backing of the people for his policy agenda at the earliest opportunity .
however , during the recent upper house elections the leader of the opposition , ichiro ozawa , proved adept at winning over disgruntled former ldp supporters in rural areas .
so an early election would mean there is a chance , admittedly pretty slim , that the people of japan might decide that after more than 50 years of liberal democratic party rule , almost without a break , it is time for the opposition to take its turn .

yasuo fukuda , who is 71 , becomes the president of the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- and is certain to be elected prime minister when parliament meets on tuesday .
he is the oldest japanese prime minister to take office since 1991 .
he replaces japan 's youngest leader in recent history , shinzo abe , who was 53 when he stepped down .
mr abe 's short-lived administration was dogged by mistakes and scandals which many said were largely the result of his inexperience .
mr fukuda , in contrast , is seen by some as a safe pair of hands .
yasuo fukuda is old but not that experienced professor koichi nakano sophia university , tokyo he is a former oilman who himself admits he lacks charisma .
" he is often described as boring , " says political analyst tsuneo watanabe , from the centre for strategic and international studies .
" but the other way of looking at that is that he represents stability . "
on the other hand , as professor koichi nakano from tokyo 's sophia university points out , he has only held one cabinet post previously .
he was the longest-serving chief cabinet secretary since the end of world war ii .
but that is not the same as running a big department like the finance ministry or the ministry of foreign affairs .
yasuo fukuda -lrb- r -rrb- in 2002 and his then boss , ex-pm junichiro koizumi " he is old but not that experienced , " the professor says .
analysts will be watching the selection of his first cabinet closely , to try to work out whether he will be allowed to lead his party or whether the powerful interest groups , the factions with the ldp , will pull the strings and control him .
that is the way it used to work .
the faction bosses would often formulate policy in the shadows , making backroom deals with each other .
one of mr fukuda 's predecessors , junichiro koizumi , tried to sweep that all away and impose his will on his cabinet .
mr abe did his best to follow that lead .
if ministerial jobs are divided up equally among the eight main factions who have backed mr fukuda , that will look like they are again planning to try to control government policy .
if mr fukuda is given more freedom to appoint who he wants for each job that will signal that he is firmly in control of the agenda .
disgruntled supporters so what will that agenda be ?
he has already made clear that he wants to try to improve relations with north korea .
he is seen as more of a " dove " on foreign policy than the " hawkish " mr abe .
he will be keen to try to improve relations with japan 's neighbours china and south korea .
he will push for an extension of japan 's naval mission in support of us-led forces in afghanistan .
that will not be easy .
the opposition which controls the country 's upper house of parliament has promised to block the legislation necessary to extend the mission .
at home he needs to try to reconnect the ldp with its traditional supporters , particularly those in rural areas who punished the government in the upper house elections in july .
mr fukuda may feel the need to gamble on an early election many in the countryside complain they have suffered as a result of the country 's economic reforms .
mr fukuda will have to decide whether to increase public spending in those areas , difficult when the country 's huge public debt is the equivalent of one and a half times japan 's gdp .
he will also face calls for a general election , to give him a mandate to govern .
that is a gamble .
the ldp currently has a huge majority in the country 's lower house of parliament .
there does not need to be an election until 2009 .
but now the opposition controls the upper house they will be able to block , or at the very least slow down or frustrate the government 's legislative agenda .
mr fukuda may feel he has no alternative but to seek the backing of the people for his policy agenda at the earliest opportunity .
however , during the recent upper house elections the leader of the opposition , ichiro ozawa , proved adept at winning over disgruntled former ldp supporters in rural areas .
so an early election would mean there is a chance , admittedly pretty slim , that the people of japan might decide that after more than 50 years of liberal democratic party rule , almost without a break , it is time for the opposition to take its turn .

jordon lyon , 10 , had already slipped from view when the csos arrived at the john pit pond in wigan in may .
on saturday , former home secretary david blunkett said it should have been " human instinct " to dive in .
but police minister tony mcnulty backed the csos , whom he said had to make a " finely balanced " judgement .
an inquest heard that jordon leapt into the water of the old colliery pond after his eight-year-old stepsister bethany got into difficulties .
two anglers waded in and pulled bethany to safety using their rods but jordon became submerged and disappeared . "
it is finely balanced , it was n't as clear cut as people were trying to point out " tony mcnulty the alarm was raised and the csos arrived .
police said they could see no sign of jordon in the water , so they radioed for help and directed the emergency services to the location .
" there is a fine line between bravery and recklessness , " mr mcnulty told sky news 's sunday live programme .
" they really did have to make a judgment on all balance of probability - going straight in with no notion of location , no notion of where he was last seen , as against trying to get further help there at the earliest opportunity .
" it is finely balanced , it was n't as clear cut as people were trying to point out .
" the notion that came up that if you see such a young child floundering and drowning your human instinct is to try to go in and save them , well of , course that is the case .
" the edge yesterday that somehow this was to do with pcsos replacing policemen i think was fundamentally wrong and a bit irresponsible . "
award call david blunkett - who introduced csos - said that " as human beings " they should have gone into the water to try to find the 10-year-old .
he also told bbc radio 4 that jordon 's courage in rescuing his stepsister should be recognised with a posthumous award .
his comments came after jordon 's distraught mother , tracy , said the csos should have " automatically " gone into the water to save a drowning child .
greater manchester police say the csos , who directed other crews to the location , were untrained in rescues and had " acted correctly " .

it is finely balanced , it was n't as clear cut as people were trying to point out tony mcnulty the alarm was raised and the csos arrived .
police said they could see no sign of jordon in the water , so they radioed for help and directed the emergency services to the location .
" there is a fine line between bravery and recklessness , " mr mcnulty told sky news 's sunday live programme .
" they really did have to make a judgment on all balance of probability - going straight in with no notion of location , no notion of where he was last seen , as against trying to get further help there at the earliest opportunity .
" it is finely balanced , it was n't as clear cut as people were trying to point out .
" the notion that came up that if you see such a young child floundering and drowning your human instinct is to try to go in and save them , well of , course that is the case .
" the edge yesterday that somehow this was to do with pcsos replacing policemen i think was fundamentally wrong and a bit irresponsible . "
award call david blunkett - who introduced csos - said that " as human beings " they should have gone into the water to try to find the 10-year-old .
he also told bbc radio 4 that jordon 's courage in rescuing his stepsister should be recognised with a posthumous award .
his comments came after jordon 's distraught mother , tracy , said the csos should have " automatically " gone into the water to save a drowning child .
greater manchester police say the csos , who directed other crews to the location , were untrained in rescues and had " acted correctly " .
