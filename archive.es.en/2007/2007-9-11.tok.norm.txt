if the party ca n't agree on a common profile , it risks losing its majority . there 's something strange going on in berlin 's grand coalition of the traditionally conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and left-leaning social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
when milk prices recently rose , top politicians in the cdu was quick to demand increased subsidies for underprivileged families , while labor minister and spd member franz müntefering warned against excessive social spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's social wing came to the fore when milk prices increased the apparent switch was n't limited to milk , as the cdu has been having a difficult time defining a common party position on foreign and security policy matters . cdu experts , including foreign policy spokesman eckart von klaeden , insisted on restricting the german military 's involvement to afghanistan 's relatively safe northern region at the same time spd defense expert rainer arnold said he did n't exclude the possibility of sending military trainers to southern afghanistan , where the danger is significantly higher . reform pressure evaporates an economic upswing at home and unexpectedly high tax revenues seem to have put the brakes on domestic reform pressure .
halfway through her four-year term , chancellor angela merkel , who is also head of the cdu , was able to conclude that the government 's leadership was operating as she " had imagined it . " with the statement , merkel signaled that she would attempt to stay in power by maintaining her sober , compensatory leadership style . indeed , public opinion seems to attribute the country 's recent successes to the grand coalition and the chancellor , while more unpopular decisions - like raising the retirement age by two years to 67 - are ascribed to spd ministers . cdu rethinks its plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu is working to distinguish itself from its coalition partner aside from the restrictions that accompany sharing power with the party it has bitterly fought for decades , the cdu 's reorientation is a consequence of its 35 percent victory in the 2005 national elections .
from this near defeat , the union 's leaders quickly realized that they would n't find support for the radical market-reform plans they 'd agreed on at the party convention in leipzig that year . party leaders began altering their course and heading toward a more state-heavy , socially oriented democracy . today , the cdu comes across as being less ideological and closer to the people than the spd , which is still going through a process of self-discovery following former chancellor gerhard schröder 's " agenda 2010 " of labor market and social reforms . shaping its party profile for critics within the conservative camp , however , merkel has ruined her party 's core conservative profile and become a servant of berlin 's center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the coalition and party headed in different directions ?
amidst continual discussions over the new party platform , leading union politicians have warned their fellow party members of a loss of conservative values .
in their view , the middle-class vote can not be won without a conservative party profile . but the cdu 's search for an accent to its own profile within the grand coalition is a sensitive topic .
if party leaders tried to take a path that diverged from that of the governing coalition , they would open the door to doubts about their credibility and competence . the long , smoldering struggle between the conservatives and the free-market liberal fdp on the one side and the left-leaning members of the cdu on the other is likely to intensify during continued platform debates .
but finding the right balancing act between the two poles has become a hallmark for the cdu and a key reason behind its success . if merkel and co. are n't able to find a binding consensus it will increase the possibility of a clearly left-leaning administration taking over in germany the next time voters go to the polls in national elections . loay mudhoon -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if the party ca n't agree on a common profile , it risks losing its majority . there 's something strange going on in berlin 's grand coalition of the traditionally conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and left-leaning social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
when milk prices recently rose , top politicians in the cdu was quick to demand increased subsidies for underprivileged families , while labor minister and spd member franz müntefering warned against excessive social spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's social wing came to the fore when milk prices increased the apparent switch was n't limited to milk , as the cdu has been having a difficult time defining a common party position on foreign and security policy matters . cdu experts , including foreign policy spokesman eckart von klaeden , insisted on restricting the german military 's involvement to afghanistan 's relatively safe northern region at the same time spd defense expert rainer arnold said he did n't exclude the possibility of sending military trainers to southern afghanistan , where the danger is significantly higher . reform pressure evaporates an economic upswing at home and unexpectedly high tax revenues seem to have put the brakes on domestic reform pressure .
halfway through her four-year term , chancellor angela merkel , who is also head of the cdu , was able to conclude that the government 's leadership was operating as she " had imagined it .

amidst continual discussions over the new party platform , leading union politicians have warned their fellow party members of a loss of conservative values .
in their view , the middle-class vote can not be won without a conservative party profile . but the cdu 's search for an accent to its own profile within the grand coalition is a sensitive topic .
if party leaders tried to take a path that diverged from that of the governing coalition , they would open the door to doubts about their credibility and competence . the long , smoldering struggle between the conservatives and the free-market liberal fdp on the one side and the left-leaning members of the cdu on the other is likely to intensify during continued platform debates .

11 , 2001 , the us has tried - without success - to democratize the arab world with violence , writes dw 's miodrag soric .
as the bloodshed continues , it 's clear that democracy ca n't be forced . democracy ca n't be prescribed like cough syrup .
after the terror attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , george w. bush believed he could quickly " convert " several islamic states to the political system of the west .
with violence , if necessary .
six years later , it 's clear that this plan has failed .
every single day , innocent people are blown to pieces and the taliban spill blood in afghanistan .
the us is still looking for an adequate answer to sept .
11 .
what about the mastermind behind the attacks - osama bin laden ?
even if the arch-enemy were to be caught , that would n't mean the end of al qaeda .
bin laden has studied economics - and has apparently learned quite a lot about building organizations .
his " terror holding " encompasses dozens of states - from bosnia and yemen to pakistan and indonesia .
al qaeda adjusts to fit the circumstances .
it maintains an enormous supply of money and manpower .
and the fact that it has no central headquarters makes it all the more difficult to fight it .
al qaeda appeals to muslims all over the world .
can people be immunized against the sickness of fundamentalism ?
if so , how ?
even though the sept .
11 perpetrators and the terror suspects recently arrested in germany do n't necessarily fit the pattern , fundamentalism and radicalism tend to grow where there is poverty and a lack of prospects .
they flourish where people are uneducated .
the us troops are neither fighting poverty nor educating the people in the muslim world .
they are not even ensuring security .
and in iraq and afghanistan , as in other muslim countries , anti-american sentiment is growing .
bin laden turned the page on a new era with the 2001 attacks on the us .
political leaders throughout the world have realized that most of the muslim states are overwhelmed and ca n't even manage to provide the ever-growing masses of young men with bread and work .
many of the traditionally islamic countries do n't have competitive economies and their governments are corrupt .
as global competition increases , some feel like they have drawn the short end of the stick .
only a few arab states enjoy hefty profits from oil exports .
yet , even there , discontent with the political and social situation is increasing .
globalization seems to be making the world more complicated .
at least that 's what the media suggests .
the desire for simple answers to the muddle of world events is growing .
demagogues and those who speak in black-and-white - especially among religious leaders - are winning followers .
millions of people trust them , often wrongly .
education is desperately needed .
but it 's also tedious and time-consuming .
many politicians , including bush , hoped that violence would speed up success .
the reality has shown , however , that democracy ca n't be prescribed , not even inoculated .

halfway through her four-year term , chancellor angela merkel , who is also head of the cdu , was able to conclude that the government 's leadership was operating as she " had imagined it . " with the statement , merkel signaled that she would attempt to stay in power by maintaining her sober , compensatory leadership style . indeed , public opinion seems to attribute the country 's recent successes to the grand coalition and the chancellor , while more unpopular decisions - like raising the retirement age by two years to 67 - are ascribed to spd ministers . cdu rethinks its plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu is working to distinguish itself from its coalition partner aside from the restrictions that accompany sharing power with the party it has bitterly fought for decades , the cdu 's reorientation is a consequence of its 35 percent victory in the 2005 national elections .
from this near defeat , the union 's leaders quickly realized that they would n't find support for the radical market-reform plans they 'd agreed on at the party convention in leipzig that year . party leaders began altering their course and heading toward a more state-heavy , socially oriented democracy . today , the cdu comes across as being less ideological and closer to the people than the spd , which is still going through a process of self-discovery following former chancellor gerhard schröder 's " agenda 2010 " of labor market and social reforms . shaping its party profile for critics within the conservative camp , however , merkel has ruined her party 's core conservative profile and become a servant of berlin 's center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the coalition and party headed in different directions ?
amidst continual discussions over the new party platform , leading union politicians have warned their fellow party members of a loss of conservative values .
in their view , the middle-class vote can not be won without a conservative party profile . but the cdu 's search for an accent to its own profile within the grand coalition is a sensitive topic .
if party leaders tried to take a path that diverged from that of the governing coalition , they would open the door to doubts about their credibility and competence . the long , smoldering struggle between the conservatives and the free-market liberal fdp on the one side and the left-leaning members of the cdu on the other is likely to intensify during continued platform debates .
but finding the right balancing act between the two poles has become a hallmark for the cdu and a key reason behind its success . if merkel and co. are n't able to find a binding consensus it will increase the possibility of a clearly left-leaning administration taking over in germany the next time voters go to the polls in national elections . loay mudhoon -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

information investigated by german police at the time has resurfaced . it 's well-known that core elements of the plot were hatched among a radicalized muslim student group in hamburg , but newspapers in germany are reviving a report from an unlikely source linking another mosque in another german city .
monday , sept .
10 , 2001 , was a morning like most others in a kindergarten in the western german city of duisburg .
that is until a little boy named mustafa arrived .
he 'd been to his weekly koran study class at the mosque the day before and had heard something weird there , says a spokesperson for the kindergarten .
" even before he took his jacket off , he came to me and blurted out that he 'd come from arabic school , and that he 'd heard some grown-ups talking there .
they 'd said that a plane was going to hit a big building and that a lot of people would die . "
at the time , all she could think was that maybe mustafa had seen too much tv , or an especially explosive action movie .
but a day later , the little boy 's words haunted the kindergarten worker .
" after 9/11 , what he 'd said came back to me .
i am positive that what he told me , he told me on the 10th of september , one day before it all happened in the us . "
evidence suggests prior knowledge in duisburg bildunterschrift : needless to say , she went to the police .
and if the story at first sounds like a bit of conspiracy-mongering , recent reports in the german media include evidence which suggests the pieces of the jigsaw fit together to form a believable picture .
mustafa 's father was a regular visitor to a mosque known to hold radical meetings .
and police found a card from the mosque when they searched mohammed atta 's hamburg apartment after the attacks on sept .
11 .
also , in a number of households of people who attended the mosque , police found the date sept .
11 , 2001 , inscribed with an arabic notice which read : " the program ends . "
in the same calendars , six months before , on the date april 15 , was inscribed in arabic : the program begins . "
that date was later to be discovered as the day when many of the hijackers slipped into the us to begin final preparations for the attacks .
the man who gave these calendars out to friends at the mosque maintains , however , that the inscriptions are coincidental .
they refer to a savings plan , he says .
guantanamo inmate was a frequent visitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ould slahi has been held at guantanamo bay since 2001 another connection to the attacks lies in the person of mohamed ould slahi .
the mauritanian national , who has been in american custody at guantanamo since 2001 , studied electrical engineering in duisburg and was a frequent visitor to the mosque .
slahi is said to have helped atta recruit men to carry out the attacks .
it is now believed he might have been one of the men young mustafa heard talking on sept .
10 .
who those other men might have been and whether they are still living in germany remains unknown .
however , authorities in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is situated , have dismissed the link between the city and the 9/11 attacks , saying police had thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the year after the attack and did not consider it important .
" we do n't think the history of sept .
11 has to be completely rewritten because of this , " state interior ministry spokesman ludger harmeier told german press agency dpa . matt hermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news is a blow to berlin mayor , klaus wowereit , who had petitioned the federal government recently to take over the opera . wowereit had pointed to the record three opera houses in the german capital and said the city , which faces a mountain of debt and depleted coffers , was unable to sufficiently finance all of them .
nevertheless , the federal government will add 100 million euros to the 50 million -lrb- a total of about $ 207 million -rrb- it had already promised for the renovation of the famous unter den linden opera , according to german news agency dpa .
in exchange , it expects berlin - which functions simultaneously as both a city and one of germany 's 16 federal states - to up its annual 37 million-euro contribution by an eight-digit sum .
steg added that the door had not been closed on discussions between state and federal culture representatives and that there were further possibilities for cooperation . bail-out not the first time chancellor merkel 's christian democrats welcomed the decision , though merkel had originally expressed support for a federal takeover of the opera house , said berlin daily tageszeitung .

it 's not the first time that berlin has turned to the federal government for help with funding a landmark or putting its finances in order .

11 , 2001 , the us has tried - without success - to democratize the arab world with violence , writes dw 's miodrag soric .
as the bloodshed continues , it 's clear that democracy ca n't be forced . democracy ca n't be prescribed like cough syrup .
after the terror attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , george w. bush believed he could quickly " convert " several islamic states to the political system of the west .
with violence , if necessary .
six years later , it 's clear that this plan has failed .
every single day , innocent people are blown to pieces and the taliban spill blood in afghanistan .
the us is still looking for an adequate answer to sept .
11 .
what about the mastermind behind the attacks - osama bin laden ?
even if the arch-enemy were to be caught , that would n't mean the end of al qaeda .
bin laden has studied economics - and has apparently learned quite a lot about building organizations .
his " terror holding " encompasses dozens of states - from bosnia and yemen to pakistan and indonesia .
al qaeda adjusts to fit the circumstances .
it maintains an enormous supply of money and manpower .

al qaeda appeals to muslims all over the world .
can people be immunized against the sickness of fundamentalism ?
if so , how ?
even though the sept .
11 perpetrators and the terror suspects recently arrested in germany do n't necessarily fit the pattern , fundamentalism and radicalism tend to grow where there is poverty and a lack of prospects .
they flourish where people are uneducated .
the us troops are neither fighting poverty nor educating the people in the muslim world .
they are not even ensuring security .

many politicians , including bush , hoped that violence would speed up success .
the reality has shown , however , that democracy ca n't be prescribed , not even inoculated .

11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .
the risk is still there . elisabeth otto interviewed tim van beveren -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , painted an encouraging picture of the situation in the country during a congressional hearing .
european papers think a miracle is needed . britain 's independent newspaper had the harshest words for the situation in iraq , saying that the latest increase in us troops " was never truly about stabilizing iraq .
the us had already lost the ability to control events on the ground when the troops began to pour in earlier this year .
its primary purpose was to stave off demands from democrats and some republicans for a timetable for a us troop withdrawal .
this is cynical and disgraceful .
but what else can we expect from a military adventure that was formed in a spirit of hubris and carried out in an atmosphere of crashing incompetence and reckless arrogance ?
the us-led occupation of iraq is unraveling in the same morally compromised manner in which it began . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger wrote that only a miracle could salvage the situation in iraq now .
" in essence , george w. bush 's vision of a democratic and secure iraq has probably failed , " it wrote .
" under the best of circumstances , the president can hope for an ' honorable peace ' like richard nixon in vietnam … the capitol hearings give the president … a window of about six months ; after that , at least five brigades will have to be withdrawn without replacement .
unless a political miracle happens in baghdad in the meantime , the regime in tehran will emerge as the victor of bush 's war because of its increased influence in iraq - and this without having spent half a trillion dollars , like washington 's warlord has . " vienna 's conservative daily die presse meanwhile cautioned people to remain open-minded about the possibility for improvement in iraq .
" it 's true : when the creator of the iraq fiasco , the american president , talks about ' signs of progress ' after a quick visit to iraq , the highest level of skepticism is called for .
this disastrous war that he started with lies will become his darkest chapter in history books in the future … but when independent reporters conclude after extensive research in the country that the security situation in several parts has improved , that the cooperation between americans , sunni leaders and iraqi security forces gets better and better - because the insurgents have gone too far with their anarchic terror against civilians - one should listen very carefully . " german business daily handelsblatt agreed that any calming of the situation represents progress .
" but compared to the original goals to turn iraq into a democratic role model for the middle east , the bar has been lowered dramatically .
washington now talks about a gentle division , about a sunnistan , shiistan and kurdistan , as if this would already signify a happy ending for iraq .
if there 's the slightest chance to prevent iraq from collapsing , it has to be pursued - no matter who will profit in terms of party politics in the us . " and the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote that it 's virtually impossible for bush to withdraw troops at this point .
" there 's no more talk about president bush 's intention to bring democracy to iraq and have it serve as an example for the arab and islamic world .
the only thing that matters now is what american soldiers can do to prevent a murderous civil war in the battered country , and whether they will continue to fight clan leaders and terrorists or withdraw and leave iraqis to deal with their own fate .
president bush can not approve a swift withdrawal , because this would not only symbolize a complete failure of his policy , but also make him responsible for a dangerous change of power relations in the middle east .

the news is a blow to berlin mayor , klaus wowereit , who had petitioned the federal government recently to take over the opera . wowereit had pointed to the record three opera houses in the german capital and said the city , which faces a mountain of debt and depleted coffers , was unable to sufficiently finance all of them .
nevertheless , the federal government will add 100 million euros to the 50 million -lrb- a total of about $ 207 million -rrb- it had already promised for the renovation of the famous unter den linden opera , according to german news agency dpa .
in exchange , it expects berlin - which functions simultaneously as both a city and one of germany 's 16 federal states - to up its annual 37 million-euro contribution by an eight-digit sum .
steg added that the door had not been closed on discussions between state and federal culture representatives and that there were further possibilities for cooperation . bail-out not the first time chancellor merkel 's christian democrats welcomed the decision , though merkel had originally expressed support for a federal takeover of the opera house , said berlin daily tageszeitung .
cdu spokesperson for cultural affairs , michael braun said the committed 150 million euros would ensure the renovation of the over 250-year-old building in downtown berlin .

information investigated by german police at the time has resurfaced . it 's well-known that core elements of the plot were hatched among a radicalized muslim student group in hamburg , but newspapers in germany are reviving a report from an unlikely source linking another mosque in another german city .
monday , sept .
10 , 2001 , was a morning like most others in a kindergarten in the western german city of duisburg .
that is until a little boy named mustafa arrived .
he 'd been to his weekly koran study class at the mosque the day before and had heard something weird there , says a spokesperson for the kindergarten .
" even before he took his jacket off , he came to me and blurted out that he 'd come from arabic school , and that he 'd heard some grown-ups talking there .
they 'd said that a plane was going to hit a big building and that a lot of people would die . "
at the time , all she could think was that maybe mustafa had seen too much tv , or an especially explosive action movie .
but a day later , the little boy 's words haunted the kindergarten worker .
" after 9/11 , what he 'd said came back to me .
i am positive that what he told me , he told me on the 10th of september , one day before it all happened in the us . "
evidence suggests prior knowledge in duisburg bildunterschrift : needless to say , she went to the police .
and if the story at first sounds like a bit of conspiracy-mongering , recent reports in the german media include evidence which suggests the pieces of the jigsaw fit together to form a believable picture .
mustafa 's father was a regular visitor to a mosque known to hold radical meetings .
and police found a card from the mosque when they searched mohammed atta 's hamburg apartment after the attacks on sept .
11 .
also , in a number of households of people who attended the mosque , police found the date sept .
11 , 2001 , inscribed with an arabic notice which read : " the program ends . "
in the same calendars , six months before , on the date april 15 , was inscribed in arabic : the program begins . "
that date was later to be discovered as the day when many of the hijackers slipped into the us to begin final preparations for the attacks .
the man who gave these calendars out to friends at the mosque maintains , however , that the inscriptions are coincidental .
they refer to a savings plan , he says .
guantanamo inmate was a frequent visitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ould slahi has been held at guantanamo bay since 2001 another connection to the attacks lies in the person of mohamed ould slahi .
the mauritanian national , who has been in american custody at guantanamo since 2001 , studied electrical engineering in duisburg and was a frequent visitor to the mosque .
slahi is said to have helped atta recruit men to carry out the attacks .
it is now believed he might have been one of the men young mustafa heard talking on sept .
10 .
who those other men might have been and whether they are still living in germany remains unknown .
however , authorities in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is situated , have dismissed the link between the city and the 9/11 attacks , saying police had thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the year after the attack and did not consider it important .
" we do n't think the history of sept .

information investigated by german police at the time has resurfaced . it 's well-known that core elements of the plot were hatched among a radicalized muslim student group in hamburg , but newspapers in germany are reviving a report from an unlikely source linking another mosque in another german city .
monday , sept .
10 , 2001 , was a morning like most others in a kindergarten in the western german city of duisburg .
that is until a little boy named mustafa arrived .
he 'd been to his weekly koran study class at the mosque the day before and had heard something weird there , says a spokesperson for the kindergarten .
" even before he took his jacket off , he came to me and blurted out that he 'd come from arabic school , and that he 'd heard some grown-ups talking there .
they 'd said that a plane was going to hit a big building and that a lot of people would die . "
at the time , all she could think was that maybe mustafa had seen too much tv , or an especially explosive action movie .
but a day later , the little boy 's words haunted the kindergarten worker .
" after 9/11 , what he 'd said came back to me .
i am positive that what he told me , he told me on the 10th of september , one day before it all happened in the us . "
evidence suggests prior knowledge in duisburg bildunterschrift : needless to say , she went to the police .
and if the story at first sounds like a bit of conspiracy-mongering , recent reports in the german media include evidence which suggests the pieces of the jigsaw fit together to form a believable picture .
mustafa 's father was a regular visitor to a mosque known to hold radical meetings .
and police found a card from the mosque when they searched mohammed atta 's hamburg apartment after the attacks on sept .
11 .
also , in a number of households of people who attended the mosque , police found the date sept .
11 , 2001 , inscribed with an arabic notice which read : " the program ends . "
in the same calendars , six months before , on the date april 15 , was inscribed in arabic : the program begins . "
that date was later to be discovered as the day when many of the hijackers slipped into the us to begin final preparations for the attacks .
the man who gave these calendars out to friends at the mosque maintains , however , that the inscriptions are coincidental .
they refer to a savings plan , he says .
guantanamo inmate was a frequent visitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ould slahi has been held at guantanamo bay since 2001 another connection to the attacks lies in the person of mohamed ould slahi .
the mauritanian national , who has been in american custody at guantanamo since 2001 , studied electrical engineering in duisburg and was a frequent visitor to the mosque .
slahi is said to have helped atta recruit men to carry out the attacks .
it is now believed he might have been one of the men young mustafa heard talking on sept .
10 .
who those other men might have been and whether they are still living in germany remains unknown .
however , authorities in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is situated , have dismissed the link between the city and the 9/11 attacks , saying police had thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the year after the attack and did not consider it important .
" we do n't think the history of sept .
11 has to be completely rewritten because of this , " state interior ministry spokesman ludger harmeier told german press agency dpa . matt hermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .

in keeping with the show 's theme " see what will move your future , " sustainable mobility includes a drastic cut in fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions .
but , gm 's european president , carl-peter foster , said that automakers would probably rely on a variety of solutions to make automobilies more environment-compatible . alternative fuels may play bigger role " i think that basically what you will see is a competition of various technologies and ultimately the one that best suits the needs " of specific segments will win , foster told reporters .

" we are not planning anything tomorrow -lsb- wednesday -rsb- at 9 a.m. , " a bmw spokesman told afp news agency , though he did not rule out further action . schlössl claimed that german automakers wanted to keep chinese companies away from the european market . daimlerchrysler had also taken issue with shuanghaun , saying its noble car was a copy of daimler 's smart city car .

11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not known exactly how many have converted to islam in germany two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .
indeed , he says , such a program would be impossible to put in place because of the uncertainty around the number of converts in germany and the lack of a central register for them . but , pfaff says , ideas such as surveillance worry some german converts to islam who , unlike their turkish or other co-religionists from the middle east , have nowhere to go if the atmosphere for muslims in germany became intolerant and rights began to disappear . " turks could go back to turkey , i suppose , and egyptians to egypt , " he said .
" but for us converts , this is our home .
that 's why i have a special interest in seeing that our rights are protected . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 , 2001 , the us has tried - without success - to democratize the arab world with violence , writes dw 's miodrag soric .
as the bloodshed continues , it 's clear that democracy ca n't be forced . democracy ca n't be prescribed like cough syrup .
after the terror attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , george w. bush believed he could quickly " convert " several islamic states to the political system of the west .
with violence , if necessary .
six years later , it 's clear that this plan has failed .
every single day , innocent people are blown to pieces and the taliban spill blood in afghanistan .
the us is still looking for an adequate answer to sept .
11 .
what about the mastermind behind the attacks - osama bin laden ?
even if the arch-enemy were to be caught , that would n't mean the end of al qaeda .
bin laden has studied economics - and has apparently learned quite a lot about building organizations .
his " terror holding " encompasses dozens of states - from bosnia and yemen to pakistan and indonesia .
al qaeda adjusts to fit the circumstances .
it maintains an enormous supply of money and manpower .
and the fact that it has no central headquarters makes it all the more difficult to fight it .
al qaeda appeals to muslims all over the world .
can people be immunized against the sickness of fundamentalism ?
if so , how ?
even though the sept .
11 perpetrators and the terror suspects recently arrested in germany do n't necessarily fit the pattern , fundamentalism and radicalism tend to grow where there is poverty and a lack of prospects .
they flourish where people are uneducated .
the us troops are neither fighting poverty nor educating the people in the muslim world .
they are not even ensuring security .
and in iraq and afghanistan , as in other muslim countries , anti-american sentiment is growing .
bin laden turned the page on a new era with the 2001 attacks on the us .
political leaders throughout the world have realized that most of the muslim states are overwhelmed and ca n't even manage to provide the ever-growing masses of young men with bread and work .
many of the traditionally islamic countries do n't have competitive economies and their governments are corrupt .
as global competition increases , some feel like they have drawn the short end of the stick .
only a few arab states enjoy hefty profits from oil exports .
yet , even there , discontent with the political and social situation is increasing .
globalization seems to be making the world more complicated .
at least that 's what the media suggests .
the desire for simple answers to the muddle of world events is growing .
demagogues and those who speak in black-and-white - especially among religious leaders - are winning followers .
millions of people trust them , often wrongly .
education is desperately needed .
but it 's also tedious and time-consuming .
many politicians , including bush , hoped that violence would speed up success .
the reality has shown , however , that democracy ca n't be prescribed , not even inoculated .

the news is a blow to berlin mayor , klaus wowereit , who had petitioned the federal government recently to take over the opera . wowereit had pointed to the record three opera houses in the german capital and said the city , which faces a mountain of debt and depleted coffers , was unable to sufficiently finance all of them .
nevertheless , the federal government will add 100 million euros to the 50 million -lrb- a total of about $ 207 million -rrb- it had already promised for the renovation of the famous unter den linden opera , according to german news agency dpa .
in exchange , it expects berlin - which functions simultaneously as both a city and one of germany 's 16 federal states - to up its annual 37 million-euro contribution by an eight-digit sum .
steg added that the door had not been closed on discussions between state and federal culture representatives and that there were further possibilities for cooperation . bail-out not the first time chancellor merkel 's christian democrats welcomed the decision , though merkel had originally expressed support for a federal takeover of the opera house , said berlin daily tageszeitung .
cdu spokesperson for cultural affairs , michael braun said the committed 150 million euros would ensure the renovation of the over 250-year-old building in downtown berlin .

german and chinese automakers also locked horns over an alleged copycat vehicle . green is all the rage when it comes to vehicles these days .
nearly every automaker showing cars at the international motor show in frankfurt had an " eco-friendly " version to introduce when the trade fair opened to the press on tuesday , sept .
11 . new models on display boasted improved fuel efficiency and engines that run on batteries or hydrogen . bildunterschrift : even former formula one ferrari driver michael schumacher -lrb- l -rrb- showed up in frankfurt ; here , with ferrari ceo luca di montezemolo us automaker giant general motors also unveiled new designs that rely on sustainable mobility .
in keeping with the show 's theme " see what will move your future , " sustainable mobility includes a drastic cut in fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions .
but , gm 's european president , carl-peter foster , said that automakers would probably rely on a variety of solutions to make automobilies more environment-compatible . alternative fuels may play bigger role " i think that basically what you will see is a competition of various technologies and ultimately the one that best suits the needs " of specific segments will win , foster told reporters . " i think that alternative fuels have to play a larger role , " he said . toyota , however , has paved the wave in going green , with its prius hybrid the leader in the industry .
the prius mixes an electric motor with a gas engine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel nozzles for hydrogen models in frankfurt even german automaker porsche - known for its luxury sports car - had a hybrid version of its cayenne suv on display in frankfurt . and , other german manufacturers did not want to be left out in the cold : volkswagen and daimlerchrysler both had " clean cars " at the fair . germany 's bmw , famous for its elegant vehicles , brought out the x6 , a new sports utility vehicle with a hybrid engine that is due to go on the market in 2009 . " we 're not just alking about cutting co2 emissions , we 're doing it , " bmw chief executive norbert reithofer told ap news agency . bmw says china copycats cars bmw , however , has had to shift gears when it comes to marketing its models . even before the motor show began , the company had locked horns with chinese automaker shuanghuan .
bmw said the chinese-made four-wheel-drive ceo was a replica of its x5 model , which it stopped producing last year . but , karl schössl , head of china automobile deutschland , the company that imports shuanghuan 's cars , said he was not concerned about pressure from bmw . bildunterschrift : citroen 's new , green " c-cactus " vehicle he told afp at the car show in frankfurt : " i am absolutely not worried " about the possiblity of cars being seized by officials . bmw said last friday that it had launched legal proceedings against the importer due to possible copyright infringements . shuanghaun 's vehicles still on show but , two different versions of the shuanghaun car went on display anyway in frankfurt , and bmw said it did not plan to have the models confiscated . " we are not planning anything tomorrow -lsb- wednesday -rsb- at 9 a.m. , " a bmw spokesman told afp news agency , though he did not rule out further action . schlössl claimed that german automakers wanted to keep chinese companies away from the european market . daimlerchrysler had also taken issue with shuanghaun , saying its noble car was a copy of daimler 's smart city car .

german and chinese automakers also locked horns over an alleged copycat vehicle . green is all the rage when it comes to vehicles these days .
nearly every automaker showing cars at the international motor show in frankfurt had an " eco-friendly " version to introduce when the trade fair opened to the press on tuesday , sept .
11 . new models on display boasted improved fuel efficiency and engines that run on batteries or hydrogen . bildunterschrift : even former formula one ferrari driver michael schumacher -lrb- l -rrb- showed up in frankfurt ; here , with ferrari ceo luca di montezemolo us automaker giant general motors also unveiled new designs that rely on sustainable mobility .
in keeping with the show 's theme " see what will move your future , " sustainable mobility includes a drastic cut in fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions .
but , gm 's european president , carl-peter foster , said that automakers would probably rely on a variety of solutions to make automobilies more environment-compatible . alternative fuels may play bigger role " i think that basically what you will see is a competition of various technologies and ultimately the one that best suits the needs " of specific segments will win , foster told reporters . " i think that alternative fuels have to play a larger role , " he said . toyota , however , has paved the wave in going green , with its prius hybrid the leader in the industry .
the prius mixes an electric motor with a gas engine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel nozzles for hydrogen models in frankfurt even german automaker porsche - known for its luxury sports car - had a hybrid version of its cayenne suv on display in frankfurt . and , other german manufacturers did not want to be left out in the cold : volkswagen and daimlerchrysler both had " clean cars " at the fair . germany 's bmw , famous for its elegant vehicles , brought out the x6 , a new sports utility vehicle with a hybrid engine that is due to go on the market in 2009 . " we 're not just alking about cutting co2 emissions , we 're doing it , " bmw chief executive norbert reithofer told ap news agency . bmw says china copycats cars bmw , however , has had to shift gears when it comes to marketing its models . even before the motor show began , the company had locked horns with chinese automaker shuanghuan .
bmw said the chinese-made four-wheel-drive ceo was a replica of its x5 model , which it stopped producing last year . but , karl schössl , head of china automobile deutschland , the company that imports shuanghuan 's cars , said he was not concerned about pressure from bmw . bildunterschrift : citroen 's new , green " c-cactus " vehicle he told afp at the car show in frankfurt : " i am absolutely not worried " about the possiblity of cars being seized by officials . bmw said last friday that it had launched legal proceedings against the importer due to possible copyright infringements . shuanghaun 's vehicles still on show but , two different versions of the shuanghaun car went on display anyway in frankfurt , and bmw said it did not plan to have the models confiscated . " we are not planning anything tomorrow -lsb- wednesday -rsb- at 9 a.m. , " a bmw spokesman told afp news agency , though he did not rule out further action . schlössl claimed that german automakers wanted to keep chinese companies away from the european market . daimlerchrysler had also taken issue with shuanghaun , saying its noble car was a copy of daimler 's smart city car .
the noble did not go on display in frankfurt . more than 1,000 companies from around 40 countries are showing their goods at frankfurt 's international motor show , which will open to the public on saturday , sept .

" the ministry said officials believed the claim , made on a web site , was authentic and that it fitted in with their investigations . " the acknowledgement emphasizes the continuing threat of islamist terrorism , " the ministry said . group planning " massive attacks " news of the islamic jihad union 's involvement comes days after german authorities arrested three men in connection with what officials say was a foiled plan to bomb us sites in germany .
the police said the attacks could have caused even worse carnage than bomb attacks in madrid or london in recent years . federal prosecutor monika harms said the cell was planning " massive " attacks . " german authorities said the men arrested - two german converts to islam and a turk - had trained in militant camps in pakistan before forming a domestic cell of the islamic jihad union which has its roots in uzbekistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canisters of hydrogen peroxide that were seized by security forces from those arrested officials said the suspects had collected massive quantities of hydrogen peroxide .
that same household chemical was used by suicide bombers in the 2005 london public transport attacks that killed 56 people . biggest security operation jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , said last week that the islamic jihad union had ties to the al qaeda terrorist network and that the men accused of planning the attacks in germany were " driven by a hatred of us citizens . " he said over 300 police officers had been monitoring the suspects over six months , and that it was one of the largest police operations of its kind in germany .
security forces decided to move in on the suspects last week when it became clear the three had begun creating bombs . news of the arrests of the homegrown terrorists have shaken germany and reignited debate over tightening security measures and better integrating its minority muslim population . the fact that two of the suspects are german converts to islam has also raised questions over whether converts to islam are more susceptible to radicalization . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not known exactly how many have converted to islam in germany two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .
indeed , he says , such a program would be impossible to put in place because of the uncertainty around the number of converts in germany and the lack of a central register for them . but , pfaff says , ideas such as surveillance worry some german converts to islam who , unlike their turkish or other co-religionists from the middle east , have nowhere to go if the atmosphere for muslims in germany became intolerant and rights began to disappear . " turks could go back to turkey , i suppose , and egyptians to egypt , " he said .
" but for us converts , this is our home .
that 's why i have a special interest in seeing that our rights are protected . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , painted an encouraging picture of the situation in the country during a congressional hearing .
european papers think a miracle is needed . britain 's independent newspaper had the harshest words for the situation in iraq , saying that the latest increase in us troops " was never truly about stabilizing iraq .
the us had already lost the ability to control events on the ground when the troops began to pour in earlier this year .
its primary purpose was to stave off demands from democrats and some republicans for a timetable for a us troop withdrawal .
this is cynical and disgraceful .
but what else can we expect from a military adventure that was formed in a spirit of hubris and carried out in an atmosphere of crashing incompetence and reckless arrogance ?
the us-led occupation of iraq is unraveling in the same morally compromised manner in which it began . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger wrote that only a miracle could salvage the situation in iraq now .
" in essence , george w. bush 's vision of a democratic and secure iraq has probably failed , " it wrote .
" under the best of circumstances , the president can hope for an ' honorable peace ' like richard nixon in vietnam … the capitol hearings give the president … a window of about six months ; after that , at least five brigades will have to be withdrawn without replacement .
unless a political miracle happens in baghdad in the meantime , the regime in tehran will emerge as the victor of bush 's war because of its increased influence in iraq - and this without having spent half a trillion dollars , like washington 's warlord has . " vienna 's conservative daily die presse meanwhile cautioned people to remain open-minded about the possibility for improvement in iraq .
" it 's true : when the creator of the iraq fiasco , the american president , talks about ' signs of progress ' after a quick visit to iraq , the highest level of skepticism is called for .
this disastrous war that he started with lies will become his darkest chapter in history books in the future … but when independent reporters conclude after extensive research in the country that the security situation in several parts has improved , that the cooperation between americans , sunni leaders and iraqi security forces gets better and better - because the insurgents have gone too far with their anarchic terror against civilians - one should listen very carefully . " german business daily handelsblatt agreed that any calming of the situation represents progress .
" but compared to the original goals to turn iraq into a democratic role model for the middle east , the bar has been lowered dramatically .
washington now talks about a gentle division , about a sunnistan , shiistan and kurdistan , as if this would already signify a happy ending for iraq .
if there 's the slightest chance to prevent iraq from collapsing , it has to be pursued - no matter who will profit in terms of party politics in the us . " and the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote that it 's virtually impossible for bush to withdraw troops at this point .
" there 's no more talk about president bush 's intention to bring democracy to iraq and have it serve as an example for the arab and islamic world .
the only thing that matters now is what american soldiers can do to prevent a murderous civil war in the battered country , and whether they will continue to fight clan leaders and terrorists or withdraw and leave iraqis to deal with their own fate .
president bush can not approve a swift withdrawal , because this would not only symbolize a complete failure of his policy , but also make him responsible for a dangerous change of power relations in the middle east .

the news is a blow to berlin mayor , klaus wowereit , who had petitioned the federal government recently to take over the opera . wowereit had pointed to the record three opera houses in the german capital and said the city , which faces a mountain of debt and depleted coffers , was unable to sufficiently finance all of them .
nevertheless , the federal government will add 100 million euros to the 50 million -lrb- a total of about $ 207 million -rrb- it had already promised for the renovation of the famous unter den linden opera , according to german news agency dpa .
in exchange , it expects berlin - which functions simultaneously as both a city and one of germany 's 16 federal states - to up its annual 37 million-euro contribution by an eight-digit sum .
steg added that the door had not been closed on discussions between state and federal culture representatives and that there were further possibilities for cooperation . bail-out not the first time chancellor merkel 's christian democrats welcomed the decision , though merkel had originally expressed support for a federal takeover of the opera house , said berlin daily tageszeitung .
cdu spokesperson for cultural affairs , michael braun said the committed 150 million euros would ensure the renovation of the over 250-year-old building in downtown berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star conductor and pianist daniel barenboim is the music director at the berlin state opera , unter den linden the federal government currently allots a major portion - 346 million euros - of its culture budget to the capital city .
since 2001 , the state of berlin has slashed its culture budget from 511 million euros to 351 million this year .
it 's not the first time that berlin has turned to the federal government for help with funding a landmark or putting its finances in order .
plagued by one of the highest unemployment rates in germany and no industry to speak of , berlin has long had a reputation of being " sexy but poor . "

what about the mastermind behind the attacks - osama bin laden ?
even if the arch-enemy were to be caught , that would n't mean the end of al qaeda .
bin laden has studied economics - and has apparently learned quite a lot about building organizations .
his " terror holding " encompasses dozens of states - from bosnia and yemen to pakistan and indonesia .
al qaeda adjusts to fit the circumstances .
it maintains an enormous supply of money and manpower .
and the fact that it has no central headquarters makes it all the more difficult to fight it .
al qaeda appeals to muslims all over the world .
can people be immunized against the sickness of fundamentalism ?
if so , how ?
even though the sept .
11 perpetrators and the terror suspects recently arrested in germany do n't necessarily fit the pattern , fundamentalism and radicalism tend to grow where there is poverty and a lack of prospects .
they flourish where people are uneducated .
the us troops are neither fighting poverty nor educating the people in the muslim world .
they are not even ensuring security .
and in iraq and afghanistan , as in other muslim countries , anti-american sentiment is growing .
bin laden turned the page on a new era with the 2001 attacks on the us .
political leaders throughout the world have realized that most of the muslim states are overwhelmed and ca n't even manage to provide the ever-growing masses of young men with bread and work .
many of the traditionally islamic countries do n't have competitive economies and their governments are corrupt .
as global competition increases , some feel like they have drawn the short end of the stick .
only a few arab states enjoy hefty profits from oil exports .
yet , even there , discontent with the political and social situation is increasing .
globalization seems to be making the world more complicated .
at least that 's what the media suggests .
the desire for simple answers to the muddle of world events is growing .
demagogues and those who speak in black-and-white - especially among religious leaders - are winning followers .
millions of people trust them , often wrongly .
education is desperately needed .
but it 's also tedious and time-consuming .
many politicians , including bush , hoped that violence would speed up success .
the reality has shown , however , that democracy ca n't be prescribed , not even inoculated .

11 , 2001 , the us has tried - without success - to democratize the arab world with violence , writes dw 's miodrag soric .
as the bloodshed continues , it 's clear that democracy ca n't be forced . democracy ca n't be prescribed like cough syrup .
after the terror attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , george w. bush believed he could quickly " convert " several islamic states to the political system of the west .
with violence , if necessary .
six years later , it 's clear that this plan has failed .
every single day , innocent people are blown to pieces and the taliban spill blood in afghanistan .
the us is still looking for an adequate answer to sept .
11 .
what about the mastermind behind the attacks - osama bin laden ?
even if the arch-enemy were to be caught , that would n't mean the end of al qaeda .
bin laden has studied economics - and has apparently learned quite a lot about building organizations .
his " terror holding " encompasses dozens of states - from bosnia and yemen to pakistan and indonesia .
al qaeda adjusts to fit the circumstances .
it maintains an enormous supply of money and manpower .
and the fact that it has no central headquarters makes it all the more difficult to fight it .
al qaeda appeals to muslims all over the world .
can people be immunized against the sickness of fundamentalism ?
if so , how ?
even though the sept .
11 perpetrators and the terror suspects recently arrested in germany do n't necessarily fit the pattern , fundamentalism and radicalism tend to grow where there is poverty and a lack of prospects .
they flourish where people are uneducated .
the us troops are neither fighting poverty nor educating the people in the muslim world .
they are not even ensuring security .
and in iraq and afghanistan , as in other muslim countries , anti-american sentiment is growing .
bin laden turned the page on a new era with the 2001 attacks on the us .
political leaders throughout the world have realized that most of the muslim states are overwhelmed and ca n't even manage to provide the ever-growing masses of young men with bread and work .
many of the traditionally islamic countries do n't have competitive economies and their governments are corrupt .
as global competition increases , some feel like they have drawn the short end of the stick .
only a few arab states enjoy hefty profits from oil exports .
yet , even there , discontent with the political and social situation is increasing .
globalization seems to be making the world more complicated .
at least that 's what the media suggests .
the desire for simple answers to the muddle of world events is growing .
demagogues and those who speak in black-and-white - especially among religious leaders - are winning followers .
millions of people trust them , often wrongly .
education is desperately needed .
but it 's also tedious and time-consuming .
many politicians , including bush , hoped that violence would speed up success .
the reality has shown , however , that democracy ca n't be prescribed , not even inoculated .

10 , painted an encouraging picture of the situation in the country during a congressional hearing .
european papers think a miracle is needed . britain 's independent newspaper had the harshest words for the situation in iraq , saying that the latest increase in us troops " was never truly about stabilizing iraq .
the us had already lost the ability to control events on the ground when the troops began to pour in earlier this year .
its primary purpose was to stave off demands from democrats and some republicans for a timetable for a us troop withdrawal .
this is cynical and disgraceful .
but what else can we expect from a military adventure that was formed in a spirit of hubris and carried out in an atmosphere of crashing incompetence and reckless arrogance ?
the us-led occupation of iraq is unraveling in the same morally compromised manner in which it began . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger wrote that only a miracle could salvage the situation in iraq now .
" in essence , george w. bush 's vision of a democratic and secure iraq has probably failed , " it wrote .
" under the best of circumstances , the president can hope for an ' honorable peace ' like richard nixon in vietnam … the capitol hearings give the president … a window of about six months ; after that , at least five brigades will have to be withdrawn without replacement .
unless a political miracle happens in baghdad in the meantime , the regime in tehran will emerge as the victor of bush 's war because of its increased influence in iraq - and this without having spent half a trillion dollars , like washington 's warlord has . " vienna 's conservative daily die presse meanwhile cautioned people to remain open-minded about the possibility for improvement in iraq .
" it 's true : when the creator of the iraq fiasco , the american president , talks about ' signs of progress ' after a quick visit to iraq , the highest level of skepticism is called for .
this disastrous war that he started with lies will become his darkest chapter in history books in the future … but when independent reporters conclude after extensive research in the country that the security situation in several parts has improved , that the cooperation between americans , sunni leaders and iraqi security forces gets better and better - because the insurgents have gone too far with their anarchic terror against civilians - one should listen very carefully . " german business daily handelsblatt agreed that any calming of the situation represents progress .
" but compared to the original goals to turn iraq into a democratic role model for the middle east , the bar has been lowered dramatically .
washington now talks about a gentle division , about a sunnistan , shiistan and kurdistan , as if this would already signify a happy ending for iraq .
if there 's the slightest chance to prevent iraq from collapsing , it has to be pursued - no matter who will profit in terms of party politics in the us . " and the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote that it 's virtually impossible for bush to withdraw troops at this point .
" there 's no more talk about president bush 's intention to bring democracy to iraq and have it serve as an example for the arab and islamic world .
the only thing that matters now is what american soldiers can do to prevent a murderous civil war in the battered country , and whether they will continue to fight clan leaders and terrorists or withdraw and leave iraqis to deal with their own fate .
president bush can not approve a swift withdrawal , because this would not only symbolize a complete failure of his policy , but also make him responsible for a dangerous change of power relations in the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 aviation security expert says 9/11 changed nature of hijackings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim van beveren says tactics for hijacking planes have changed since sept .
11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .

11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .
the risk is still there . elisabeth otto interviewed tim van beveren -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .

10 , painted an encouraging picture of the situation in the country during a congressional hearing .
european papers think a miracle is needed . britain 's independent newspaper had the harshest words for the situation in iraq , saying that the latest increase in us troops " was never truly about stabilizing iraq .
the us had already lost the ability to control events on the ground when the troops began to pour in earlier this year .
its primary purpose was to stave off demands from democrats and some republicans for a timetable for a us troop withdrawal .
this is cynical and disgraceful .
but what else can we expect from a military adventure that was formed in a spirit of hubris and carried out in an atmosphere of crashing incompetence and reckless arrogance ?
the us-led occupation of iraq is unraveling in the same morally compromised manner in which it began . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger wrote that only a miracle could salvage the situation in iraq now .
" in essence , george w. bush 's vision of a democratic and secure iraq has probably failed , " it wrote .
" under the best of circumstances , the president can hope for an ' honorable peace ' like richard nixon in vietnam … the capitol hearings give the president … a window of about six months ; after that , at least five brigades will have to be withdrawn without replacement .
unless a political miracle happens in baghdad in the meantime , the regime in tehran will emerge as the victor of bush 's war because of its increased influence in iraq - and this without having spent half a trillion dollars , like washington 's warlord has . " vienna 's conservative daily die presse meanwhile cautioned people to remain open-minded about the possibility for improvement in iraq .
" it 's true : when the creator of the iraq fiasco , the american president , talks about ' signs of progress ' after a quick visit to iraq , the highest level of skepticism is called for .
this disastrous war that he started with lies will become his darkest chapter in history books in the future … but when independent reporters conclude after extensive research in the country that the security situation in several parts has improved , that the cooperation between americans , sunni leaders and iraqi security forces gets better and better - because the insurgents have gone too far with their anarchic terror against civilians - one should listen very carefully . " german business daily handelsblatt agreed that any calming of the situation represents progress .
" but compared to the original goals to turn iraq into a democratic role model for the middle east , the bar has been lowered dramatically .
washington now talks about a gentle division , about a sunnistan , shiistan and kurdistan , as if this would already signify a happy ending for iraq .
if there 's the slightest chance to prevent iraq from collapsing , it has to be pursued - no matter who will profit in terms of party politics in the us . " and the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote that it 's virtually impossible for bush to withdraw troops at this point .
" there 's no more talk about president bush 's intention to bring democracy to iraq and have it serve as an example for the arab and islamic world .
the only thing that matters now is what american soldiers can do to prevent a murderous civil war in the battered country , and whether they will continue to fight clan leaders and terrorists or withdraw and leave iraqis to deal with their own fate .
president bush can not approve a swift withdrawal , because this would not only symbolize a complete failure of his policy , but also make him responsible for a dangerous change of power relations in the middle east .

dw-world.de survey pinpoints iraq , bush as main reasons for us-eu rift a new poll has found that us-eu ties are unlikely to recover even after the election of a new american president next year .
at the same time , most europeans favor cooperation with the us in dealing with global threats .
-lrb- 07.09.2007 -rrb- experts : uk iraq pullout a prelude to chaos , strained relations british troops withdrew from their basra palace base for the relative safety of their main compound outside the city monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 aviation security expert says 9/11 changed nature of hijackings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim van beveren says tactics for hijacking planes have changed since sept .
11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .
the risk is still there . elisabeth otto interviewed tim van beveren -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , painted an encouraging picture of the situation in the country during a congressional hearing .
european papers think a miracle is needed . britain 's independent newspaper had the harshest words for the situation in iraq , saying that the latest increase in us troops " was never truly about stabilizing iraq .
the us had already lost the ability to control events on the ground when the troops began to pour in earlier this year .
its primary purpose was to stave off demands from democrats and some republicans for a timetable for a us troop withdrawal .
this is cynical and disgraceful .
but what else can we expect from a military adventure that was formed in a spirit of hubris and carried out in an atmosphere of crashing incompetence and reckless arrogance ?
the us-led occupation of iraq is unraveling in the same morally compromised manner in which it began . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger wrote that only a miracle could salvage the situation in iraq now .
" in essence , george w. bush 's vision of a democratic and secure iraq has probably failed , " it wrote .
" under the best of circumstances , the president can hope for an ' honorable peace ' like richard nixon in vietnam … the capitol hearings give the president … a window of about six months ; after that , at least five brigades will have to be withdrawn without replacement .
unless a political miracle happens in baghdad in the meantime , the regime in tehran will emerge as the victor of bush 's war because of its increased influence in iraq - and this without having spent half a trillion dollars , like washington 's warlord has . " vienna 's conservative daily die presse meanwhile cautioned people to remain open-minded about the possibility for improvement in iraq .
" it 's true : when the creator of the iraq fiasco , the american president , talks about ' signs of progress ' after a quick visit to iraq , the highest level of skepticism is called for .
this disastrous war that he started with lies will become his darkest chapter in history books in the future … but when independent reporters conclude after extensive research in the country that the security situation in several parts has improved , that the cooperation between americans , sunni leaders and iraqi security forces gets better and better - because the insurgents have gone too far with their anarchic terror against civilians - one should listen very carefully . " german business daily handelsblatt agreed that any calming of the situation represents progress .
" but compared to the original goals to turn iraq into a democratic role model for the middle east , the bar has been lowered dramatically .
washington now talks about a gentle division , about a sunnistan , shiistan and kurdistan , as if this would already signify a happy ending for iraq .
if there 's the slightest chance to prevent iraq from collapsing , it has to be pursued - no matter who will profit in terms of party politics in the us . " and the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote that it 's virtually impossible for bush to withdraw troops at this point .
" there 's no more talk about president bush 's intention to bring democracy to iraq and have it serve as an example for the arab and islamic world .
the only thing that matters now is what american soldiers can do to prevent a murderous civil war in the battered country , and whether they will continue to fight clan leaders and terrorists or withdraw and leave iraqis to deal with their own fate .
president bush can not approve a swift withdrawal , because this would not only symbolize a complete failure of his policy , but also make him responsible for a dangerous change of power relations in the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not known exactly how many have converted to islam in germany two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .
indeed , he says , such a program would be impossible to put in place because of the uncertainty around the number of converts in germany and the lack of a central register for them . but , pfaff says , ideas such as surveillance worry some german converts to islam who , unlike their turkish or other co-religionists from the middle east , have nowhere to go if the atmosphere for muslims in germany became intolerant and rights began to disappear . " turks could go back to turkey , i suppose , and egyptians to egypt , " he said .
" but for us converts , this is our home .
that 's why i have a special interest in seeing that our rights are protected . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .
indeed , he says , such a program would be impossible to put in place because of the uncertainty around the number of converts in germany and the lack of a central register for them . but , pfaff says , ideas such as surveillance worry some german converts to islam who , unlike their turkish or other co-religionists from the middle east , have nowhere to go if the atmosphere for muslims in germany became intolerant and rights began to disappear . " turks could go back to turkey , i suppose , and egyptians to egypt , " he said .
" but for us converts , this is our home .
that 's why i have a special interest in seeing that our rights are protected . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 11.09.2007 government gives helping hand to refurbish berlin opera großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's state opera house " unter den linden " was completed in 1743 the german federal government has refused to take over berlin 's famous and cash-strapped state opera house " unter den linden , " but it will pay for major renovation costs . the german government 's deputy spokesman , thomas steg , confirmed this week that the government was not interested in a takeover of berlin 's historic 18th century unter den linder state opera house . .
the news is a blow to berlin mayor , klaus wowereit , who had petitioned the federal government recently to take over the opera . wowereit had pointed to the record three opera houses in the german capital and said the city , which faces a mountain of debt and depleted coffers , was unable to sufficiently finance all of them .
nevertheless , the federal government will add 100 million euros to the 50 million -lrb- a total of about $ 207 million -rrb- it had already promised for the renovation of the famous unter den linden opera , according to german news agency dpa .
in exchange , it expects berlin - which functions simultaneously as both a city and one of germany 's 16 federal states - to up its annual 37 million-euro contribution by an eight-digit sum .
steg added that the door had not been closed on discussions between state and federal culture representatives and that there were further possibilities for cooperation . bail-out not the first time chancellor merkel 's christian democrats welcomed the decision , though merkel had originally expressed support for a federal takeover of the opera house , said berlin daily tageszeitung .
cdu spokesperson for cultural affairs , michael braun said the committed 150 million euros would ensure the renovation of the over 250-year-old building in downtown berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star conductor and pianist daniel barenboim is the music director at the berlin state opera , unter den linden the federal government currently allots a major portion - 346 million euros - of its culture budget to the capital city .
since 2001 , the state of berlin has slashed its culture budget from 511 million euros to 351 million this year .
it 's not the first time that berlin has turned to the federal government for help with funding a landmark or putting its finances in order .
plagued by one of the highest unemployment rates in germany and no industry to speak of , berlin has long had a reputation of being " sexy but poor . "

the news is a blow to berlin mayor , klaus wowereit , who had petitioned the federal government recently to take over the opera . wowereit had pointed to the record three opera houses in the german capital and said the city , which faces a mountain of debt and depleted coffers , was unable to sufficiently finance all of them .
nevertheless , the federal government will add 100 million euros to the 50 million -lrb- a total of about $ 207 million -rrb- it had already promised for the renovation of the famous unter den linden opera , according to german news agency dpa .
in exchange , it expects berlin - which functions simultaneously as both a city and one of germany 's 16 federal states - to up its annual 37 million-euro contribution by an eight-digit sum .
steg added that the door had not been closed on discussions between state and federal culture representatives and that there were further possibilities for cooperation . bail-out not the first time chancellor merkel 's christian democrats welcomed the decision , though merkel had originally expressed support for a federal takeover of the opera house , said berlin daily tageszeitung .
cdu spokesperson for cultural affairs , michael braun said the committed 150 million euros would ensure the renovation of the over 250-year-old building in downtown berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star conductor and pianist daniel barenboim is the music director at the berlin state opera , unter den linden the federal government currently allots a major portion - 346 million euros - of its culture budget to the capital city .
since 2001 , the state of berlin has slashed its culture budget from 511 million euros to 351 million this year .
it 's not the first time that berlin has turned to the federal government for help with funding a landmark or putting its finances in order .
plagued by one of the highest unemployment rates in germany and no industry to speak of , berlin has long had a reputation of being " sexy but poor . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not known exactly how many have converted to islam in germany two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .
indeed , he says , such a program would be impossible to put in place because of the uncertainty around the number of converts in germany and the lack of a central register for them . but , pfaff says , ideas such as surveillance worry some german converts to islam who , unlike their turkish or other co-religionists from the middle east , have nowhere to go if the atmosphere for muslims in germany became intolerant and rights began to disappear . " turks could go back to turkey , i suppose , and egyptians to egypt , " he said .
" but for us converts , this is our home .
that 's why i have a special interest in seeing that our rights are protected . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 alleged duisburg link stirs debate on 9/11 anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cell behind the 9/11 attacks could have had links to duisburg six years have passed since the 9/11 attacks but new information about the hijackers and the origins of their plan continues to come to light .
information investigated by german police at the time has resurfaced . it 's well-known that core elements of the plot were hatched among a radicalized muslim student group in hamburg , but newspapers in germany are reviving a report from an unlikely source linking another mosque in another german city .
monday , sept .
10 , 2001 , was a morning like most others in a kindergarten in the western german city of duisburg .
that is until a little boy named mustafa arrived .
he 'd been to his weekly koran study class at the mosque the day before and had heard something weird there , says a spokesperson for the kindergarten .
" even before he took his jacket off , he came to me and blurted out that he 'd come from arabic school , and that he 'd heard some grown-ups talking there .
they 'd said that a plane was going to hit a big building and that a lot of people would die . "
at the time , all she could think was that maybe mustafa had seen too much tv , or an especially explosive action movie .
but a day later , the little boy 's words haunted the kindergarten worker .
" after 9/11 , what he 'd said came back to me .
i am positive that what he told me , he told me on the 10th of september , one day before it all happened in the us . "
evidence suggests prior knowledge in duisburg bildunterschrift : needless to say , she went to the police .
and if the story at first sounds like a bit of conspiracy-mongering , recent reports in the german media include evidence which suggests the pieces of the jigsaw fit together to form a believable picture .
mustafa 's father was a regular visitor to a mosque known to hold radical meetings .
and police found a card from the mosque when they searched mohammed atta 's hamburg apartment after the attacks on sept .
11 .
also , in a number of households of people who attended the mosque , police found the date sept .
11 , 2001 , inscribed with an arabic notice which read : " the program ends . "
in the same calendars , six months before , on the date april 15 , was inscribed in arabic : the program begins . "
that date was later to be discovered as the day when many of the hijackers slipped into the us to begin final preparations for the attacks .
the man who gave these calendars out to friends at the mosque maintains , however , that the inscriptions are coincidental .
they refer to a savings plan , he says .
guantanamo inmate was a frequent visitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ould slahi has been held at guantanamo bay since 2001 another connection to the attacks lies in the person of mohamed ould slahi .
the mauritanian national , who has been in american custody at guantanamo since 2001 , studied electrical engineering in duisburg and was a frequent visitor to the mosque .
slahi is said to have helped atta recruit men to carry out the attacks .
it is now believed he might have been one of the men young mustafa heard talking on sept .
10 .
who those other men might have been and whether they are still living in germany remains unknown .
however , authorities in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is situated , have dismissed the link between the city and the 9/11 attacks , saying police had thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the year after the attack and did not consider it important .
" we do n't think the history of sept .
11 has to be completely rewritten because of this , " state interior ministry spokesman ludger harmeier told german press agency dpa . matt hermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11th the us military and german police increased security at a us air base near the western city of trier following an anonymous bomb threat on tuesday , the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us . following a bomb threat from an anonymous telephone caller , german police and the us military mounted a large-scale security operation at the spangdahlem air base close to trier , near the border with luxembourg . though police said they believed the call was a hoax , security was increased as a " preventative measure . " police said there was no " concrete threat " to the public , but that the security operation was a precaution due to the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us . german police said that the us base at spangdahlem received the telephone threat late monday afternoon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not known exactly how many have converted to islam in germany two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .
indeed , he says , such a program would be impossible to put in place because of the uncertainty around the number of converts in germany and the lack of a central register for them . but , pfaff says , ideas such as surveillance worry some german converts to islam who , unlike their turkish or other co-religionists from the middle east , have nowhere to go if the atmosphere for muslims in germany became intolerant and rights began to disappear . " turks could go back to turkey , i suppose , and egyptians to egypt , " he said .
" but for us converts , this is our home .
that 's why i have a special interest in seeing that our rights are protected . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

information investigated by german police at the time has resurfaced . it 's well-known that core elements of the plot were hatched among a radicalized muslim student group in hamburg , but newspapers in germany are reviving a report from an unlikely source linking another mosque in another german city .
monday , sept .
10 , 2001 , was a morning like most others in a kindergarten in the western german city of duisburg .
that is until a little boy named mustafa arrived .
he 'd been to his weekly koran study class at the mosque the day before and had heard something weird there , says a spokesperson for the kindergarten .
" even before he took his jacket off , he came to me and blurted out that he 'd come from arabic school , and that he 'd heard some grown-ups talking there .
they 'd said that a plane was going to hit a big building and that a lot of people would die . "
at the time , all she could think was that maybe mustafa had seen too much tv , or an especially explosive action movie .
but a day later , the little boy 's words haunted the kindergarten worker .
" after 9/11 , what he 'd said came back to me .
i am positive that what he told me , he told me on the 10th of september , one day before it all happened in the us . "
evidence suggests prior knowledge in duisburg bildunterschrift : needless to say , she went to the police .
and if the story at first sounds like a bit of conspiracy-mongering , recent reports in the german media include evidence which suggests the pieces of the jigsaw fit together to form a believable picture .
mustafa 's father was a regular visitor to a mosque known to hold radical meetings .
and police found a card from the mosque when they searched mohammed atta 's hamburg apartment after the attacks on sept .
11 .
also , in a number of households of people who attended the mosque , police found the date sept .
11 , 2001 , inscribed with an arabic notice which read : " the program ends . "
in the same calendars , six months before , on the date april 15 , was inscribed in arabic : the program begins . "
that date was later to be discovered as the day when many of the hijackers slipped into the us to begin final preparations for the attacks .
the man who gave these calendars out to friends at the mosque maintains , however , that the inscriptions are coincidental .
they refer to a savings plan , he says .
guantanamo inmate was a frequent visitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ould slahi has been held at guantanamo bay since 2001 another connection to the attacks lies in the person of mohamed ould slahi .
the mauritanian national , who has been in american custody at guantanamo since 2001 , studied electrical engineering in duisburg and was a frequent visitor to the mosque .
slahi is said to have helped atta recruit men to carry out the attacks .
it is now believed he might have been one of the men young mustafa heard talking on sept .
10 .
who those other men might have been and whether they are still living in germany remains unknown .
however , authorities in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is situated , have dismissed the link between the city and the 9/11 attacks , saying police had thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the year after the attack and did not consider it important .
" we do n't think the history of sept .
11 has to be completely rewritten because of this , " state interior ministry spokesman ludger harmeier told german press agency dpa . matt hermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not known exactly how many have converted to islam in germany two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .

it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .

information investigated by german police at the time has resurfaced . it 's well-known that core elements of the plot were hatched among a radicalized muslim student group in hamburg , but newspapers in germany are reviving a report from an unlikely source linking another mosque in another german city .
monday , sept .
10 , 2001 , was a morning like most others in a kindergarten in the western german city of duisburg .
that is until a little boy named mustafa arrived .
he 'd been to his weekly koran study class at the mosque the day before and had heard something weird there , says a spokesperson for the kindergarten .
" even before he took his jacket off , he came to me and blurted out that he 'd come from arabic school , and that he 'd heard some grown-ups talking there .
they 'd said that a plane was going to hit a big building and that a lot of people would die . "
at the time , all she could think was that maybe mustafa had seen too much tv , or an especially explosive action movie .
but a day later , the little boy 's words haunted the kindergarten worker .
" after 9/11 , what he 'd said came back to me .
i am positive that what he told me , he told me on the 10th of september , one day before it all happened in the us . "
evidence suggests prior knowledge in duisburg bildunterschrift : needless to say , she went to the police .
and if the story at first sounds like a bit of conspiracy-mongering , recent reports in the german media include evidence which suggests the pieces of the jigsaw fit together to form a believable picture .
mustafa 's father was a regular visitor to a mosque known to hold radical meetings .
and police found a card from the mosque when they searched mohammed atta 's hamburg apartment after the attacks on sept .
11 .
also , in a number of households of people who attended the mosque , police found the date sept .
11 , 2001 , inscribed with an arabic notice which read : " the program ends . "
in the same calendars , six months before , on the date april 15 , was inscribed in arabic : the program begins . "
that date was later to be discovered as the day when many of the hijackers slipped into the us to begin final preparations for the attacks .
the man who gave these calendars out to friends at the mosque maintains , however , that the inscriptions are coincidental .
they refer to a savings plan , he says .
guantanamo inmate was a frequent visitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ould slahi has been held at guantanamo bay since 2001 another connection to the attacks lies in the person of mohamed ould slahi .
the mauritanian national , who has been in american custody at guantanamo since 2001 , studied electrical engineering in duisburg and was a frequent visitor to the mosque .
slahi is said to have helped atta recruit men to carry out the attacks .
it is now believed he might have been one of the men young mustafa heard talking on sept .
10 .
who those other men might have been and whether they are still living in germany remains unknown .
however , authorities in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is situated , have dismissed the link between the city and the 9/11 attacks , saying police had thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the year after the attack and did not consider it important .
" we do n't think the history of sept .

10 , painted an encouraging picture of the situation in the country during a congressional hearing .
european papers think a miracle is needed . britain 's independent newspaper had the harshest words for the situation in iraq , saying that the latest increase in us troops " was never truly about stabilizing iraq .
the us had already lost the ability to control events on the ground when the troops began to pour in earlier this year .
its primary purpose was to stave off demands from democrats and some republicans for a timetable for a us troop withdrawal .
this is cynical and disgraceful .
but what else can we expect from a military adventure that was formed in a spirit of hubris and carried out in an atmosphere of crashing incompetence and reckless arrogance ?
the us-led occupation of iraq is unraveling in the same morally compromised manner in which it began . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger wrote that only a miracle could salvage the situation in iraq now .
" in essence , george w. bush 's vision of a democratic and secure iraq has probably failed , " it wrote .
" under the best of circumstances , the president can hope for an ' honorable peace ' like richard nixon in vietnam … the capitol hearings give the president … a window of about six months ; after that , at least five brigades will have to be withdrawn without replacement .
unless a political miracle happens in baghdad in the meantime , the regime in tehran will emerge as the victor of bush 's war because of its increased influence in iraq - and this without having spent half a trillion dollars , like washington 's warlord has . " vienna 's conservative daily die presse meanwhile cautioned people to remain open-minded about the possibility for improvement in iraq .
" it 's true : when the creator of the iraq fiasco , the american president , talks about ' signs of progress ' after a quick visit to iraq , the highest level of skepticism is called for .
this disastrous war that he started with lies will become his darkest chapter in history books in the future … but when independent reporters conclude after extensive research in the country that the security situation in several parts has improved , that the cooperation between americans , sunni leaders and iraqi security forces gets better and better - because the insurgents have gone too far with their anarchic terror against civilians - one should listen very carefully . " german business daily handelsblatt agreed that any calming of the situation represents progress .
" but compared to the original goals to turn iraq into a democratic role model for the middle east , the bar has been lowered dramatically .
washington now talks about a gentle division , about a sunnistan , shiistan and kurdistan , as if this would already signify a happy ending for iraq .
if there 's the slightest chance to prevent iraq from collapsing , it has to be pursued - no matter who will profit in terms of party politics in the us . " and the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote that it 's virtually impossible for bush to withdraw troops at this point .
" there 's no more talk about president bush 's intention to bring democracy to iraq and have it serve as an example for the arab and islamic world .
the only thing that matters now is what american soldiers can do to prevent a murderous civil war in the battered country , and whether they will continue to fight clan leaders and terrorists or withdraw and leave iraqis to deal with their own fate .
president bush can not approve a swift withdrawal , because this would not only symbolize a complete failure of his policy , but also make him responsible for a dangerous change of power relations in the middle east .

i am positive that what he told me , he told me on the 10th of september , one day before it all happened in the us . "
evidence suggests prior knowledge in duisburg bildunterschrift : needless to say , she went to the police .
and if the story at first sounds like a bit of conspiracy-mongering , recent reports in the german media include evidence which suggests the pieces of the jigsaw fit together to form a believable picture .
mustafa 's father was a regular visitor to a mosque known to hold radical meetings .
and police found a card from the mosque when they searched mohammed atta 's hamburg apartment after the attacks on sept .
11 .
also , in a number of households of people who attended the mosque , police found the date sept .
11 , 2001 , inscribed with an arabic notice which read : " the program ends . "
in the same calendars , six months before , on the date april 15 , was inscribed in arabic : the program begins . "
that date was later to be discovered as the day when many of the hijackers slipped into the us to begin final preparations for the attacks .
the man who gave these calendars out to friends at the mosque maintains , however , that the inscriptions are coincidental .
they refer to a savings plan , he says .
guantanamo inmate was a frequent visitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ould slahi has been held at guantanamo bay since 2001 another connection to the attacks lies in the person of mohamed ould slahi .
the mauritanian national , who has been in american custody at guantanamo since 2001 , studied electrical engineering in duisburg and was a frequent visitor to the mosque .
slahi is said to have helped atta recruit men to carry out the attacks .
it is now believed he might have been one of the men young mustafa heard talking on sept .
10 .
who those other men might have been and whether they are still living in germany remains unknown .
however , authorities in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is situated , have dismissed the link between the city and the 9/11 attacks , saying police had thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the year after the attack and did not consider it important .
" we do n't think the history of sept .

11 , 2001 , the us has tried - without success - to democratize the arab world with violence , writes dw 's miodrag soric .
as the bloodshed continues , it 's clear that democracy ca n't be forced . democracy ca n't be prescribed like cough syrup .
after the terror attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , george w. bush believed he could quickly " convert " several islamic states to the political system of the west .
with violence , if necessary .
six years later , it 's clear that this plan has failed .
every single day , innocent people are blown to pieces and the taliban spill blood in afghanistan .
the us is still looking for an adequate answer to sept .
11 .
what about the mastermind behind the attacks - osama bin laden ?
even if the arch-enemy were to be caught , that would n't mean the end of al qaeda .
bin laden has studied economics - and has apparently learned quite a lot about building organizations .
his " terror holding " encompasses dozens of states - from bosnia and yemen to pakistan and indonesia .
al qaeda adjusts to fit the circumstances .
it maintains an enormous supply of money and manpower .
and the fact that it has no central headquarters makes it all the more difficult to fight it .
al qaeda appeals to muslims all over the world .
can people be immunized against the sickness of fundamentalism ?
if so , how ?
even though the sept .
11 perpetrators and the terror suspects recently arrested in germany do n't necessarily fit the pattern , fundamentalism and radicalism tend to grow where there is poverty and a lack of prospects .
they flourish where people are uneducated .
the us troops are neither fighting poverty nor educating the people in the muslim world .
they are not even ensuring security .
and in iraq and afghanistan , as in other muslim countries , anti-american sentiment is growing .
bin laden turned the page on a new era with the 2001 attacks on the us .
political leaders throughout the world have realized that most of the muslim states are overwhelmed and ca n't even manage to provide the ever-growing masses of young men with bread and work .
many of the traditionally islamic countries do n't have competitive economies and their governments are corrupt .
as global competition increases , some feel like they have drawn the short end of the stick .

10 , painted an encouraging picture of the situation in the country during a congressional hearing .
european papers think a miracle is needed . britain 's independent newspaper had the harshest words for the situation in iraq , saying that the latest increase in us troops " was never truly about stabilizing iraq .
the us had already lost the ability to control events on the ground when the troops began to pour in earlier this year .
its primary purpose was to stave off demands from democrats and some republicans for a timetable for a us troop withdrawal .
this is cynical and disgraceful .
but what else can we expect from a military adventure that was formed in a spirit of hubris and carried out in an atmosphere of crashing incompetence and reckless arrogance ?
the us-led occupation of iraq is unraveling in the same morally compromised manner in which it began . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger wrote that only a miracle could salvage the situation in iraq now .
" in essence , george w. bush 's vision of a democratic and secure iraq has probably failed , " it wrote .
" under the best of circumstances , the president can hope for an ' honorable peace ' like richard nixon in vietnam … the capitol hearings give the president … a window of about six months ; after that , at least five brigades will have to be withdrawn without replacement .
unless a political miracle happens in baghdad in the meantime , the regime in tehran will emerge as the victor of bush 's war because of its increased influence in iraq - and this without having spent half a trillion dollars , like washington 's warlord has . " vienna 's conservative daily die presse meanwhile cautioned people to remain open-minded about the possibility for improvement in iraq .
" it 's true : when the creator of the iraq fiasco , the american president , talks about ' signs of progress ' after a quick visit to iraq , the highest level of skepticism is called for .
this disastrous war that he started with lies will become his darkest chapter in history books in the future … but when independent reporters conclude after extensive research in the country that the security situation in several parts has improved , that the cooperation between americans , sunni leaders and iraqi security forces gets better and better - because the insurgents have gone too far with their anarchic terror against civilians - one should listen very carefully . " german business daily handelsblatt agreed that any calming of the situation represents progress .
" but compared to the original goals to turn iraq into a democratic role model for the middle east , the bar has been lowered dramatically .
washington now talks about a gentle division , about a sunnistan , shiistan and kurdistan , as if this would already signify a happy ending for iraq .
if there 's the slightest chance to prevent iraq from collapsing , it has to be pursued - no matter who will profit in terms of party politics in the us . " and the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote that it 's virtually impossible for bush to withdraw troops at this point .
" there 's no more talk about president bush 's intention to bring democracy to iraq and have it serve as an example for the arab and islamic world .
the only thing that matters now is what american soldiers can do to prevent a murderous civil war in the battered country , and whether they will continue to fight clan leaders and terrorists or withdraw and leave iraqis to deal with their own fate .
president bush can not approve a swift withdrawal , because this would not only symbolize a complete failure of his policy , but also make him responsible for a dangerous change of power relations in the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 aviation security expert says 9/11 changed nature of hijackings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim van beveren says tactics for hijacking planes have changed since sept .
11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .
the risk is still there . elisabeth otto interviewed tim van beveren -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .
the risk is still there . elisabeth otto interviewed tim van beveren -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 aviation security expert says 9/11 changed nature of hijackings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim van beveren says tactics for hijacking planes have changed since sept .
11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .

11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .

information investigated by german police at the time has resurfaced . it 's well-known that core elements of the plot were hatched among a radicalized muslim student group in hamburg , but newspapers in germany are reviving a report from an unlikely source linking another mosque in another german city .
monday , sept .
10 , 2001 , was a morning like most others in a kindergarten in the western german city of duisburg .
that is until a little boy named mustafa arrived .
he 'd been to his weekly koran study class at the mosque the day before and had heard something weird there , says a spokesperson for the kindergarten .
" even before he took his jacket off , he came to me and blurted out that he 'd come from arabic school , and that he 'd heard some grown-ups talking there .
they 'd said that a plane was going to hit a big building and that a lot of people would die . "
at the time , all she could think was that maybe mustafa had seen too much tv , or an especially explosive action movie .
but a day later , the little boy 's words haunted the kindergarten worker .
" after 9/11 , what he 'd said came back to me .
i am positive that what he told me , he told me on the 10th of september , one day before it all happened in the us . "
evidence suggests prior knowledge in duisburg bildunterschrift : needless to say , she went to the police .
and if the story at first sounds like a bit of conspiracy-mongering , recent reports in the german media include evidence which suggests the pieces of the jigsaw fit together to form a believable picture .
mustafa 's father was a regular visitor to a mosque known to hold radical meetings .
and police found a card from the mosque when they searched mohammed atta 's hamburg apartment after the attacks on sept .
11 .
also , in a number of households of people who attended the mosque , police found the date sept .
11 , 2001 , inscribed with an arabic notice which read : " the program ends . "
in the same calendars , six months before , on the date april 15 , was inscribed in arabic : the program begins . "
that date was later to be discovered as the day when many of the hijackers slipped into the us to begin final preparations for the attacks .
the man who gave these calendars out to friends at the mosque maintains , however , that the inscriptions are coincidental .
they refer to a savings plan , he says .
guantanamo inmate was a frequent visitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ould slahi has been held at guantanamo bay since 2001 another connection to the attacks lies in the person of mohamed ould slahi .
the mauritanian national , who has been in american custody at guantanamo since 2001 , studied electrical engineering in duisburg and was a frequent visitor to the mosque .
slahi is said to have helped atta recruit men to carry out the attacks .
it is now believed he might have been one of the men young mustafa heard talking on sept .
10 .
who those other men might have been and whether they are still living in germany remains unknown .
however , authorities in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is situated , have dismissed the link between the city and the 9/11 attacks , saying police had thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the year after the attack and did not consider it important .
" we do n't think the history of sept .
11 has to be completely rewritten because of this , " state interior ministry spokesman ludger harmeier told german press agency dpa . matt hermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ministry said officials believed the claim , made on a web site , was authentic and that it fitted in with their investigations . " the acknowledgement emphasizes the continuing threat of islamist terrorism , " the ministry said . group planning " massive attacks " news of the islamic jihad union 's involvement comes days after german authorities arrested three men in connection with what officials say was a foiled plan to bomb us sites in germany .
the police said the attacks could have caused even worse carnage than bomb attacks in madrid or london in recent years . federal prosecutor monika harms said the cell was planning " massive " attacks .

" he said over 300 police officers had been monitoring the suspects over six months , and that it was one of the largest police operations of its kind in germany .
security forces decided to move in on the suspects last week when it became clear the three had begun creating bombs . news of the arrests of the homegrown terrorists have shaken germany and reignited debate over tightening security measures and better integrating its minority muslim population . the fact that two of the suspects are german converts to islam has also raised questions over whether converts to islam are more susceptible to radicalization . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ministry said officials believed the claim , made on a web site , was authentic and that it fitted in with their investigations . " the acknowledgement emphasizes the continuing threat of islamist terrorism , " the ministry said . group planning " massive attacks " news of the islamic jihad union 's involvement comes days after german authorities arrested three men in connection with what officials say was a foiled plan to bomb us sites in germany .
the police said the attacks could have caused even worse carnage than bomb attacks in madrid or london in recent years . federal prosecutor monika harms said the cell was planning " massive " attacks . " german authorities said the men arrested - two german converts to islam and a turk - had trained in militant camps in pakistan before forming a domestic cell of the islamic jihad union which has its roots in uzbekistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canisters of hydrogen peroxide that were seized by security forces from those arrested officials said the suspects had collected massive quantities of hydrogen peroxide .

" he said over 300 police officers had been monitoring the suspects over six months , and that it was one of the largest police operations of its kind in germany .
security forces decided to move in on the suspects last week when it became clear the three had begun creating bombs . news of the arrests of the homegrown terrorists have shaken germany and reignited debate over tightening security measures and better integrating its minority muslim population . the fact that two of the suspects are german converts to islam has also raised questions over whether converts to islam are more susceptible to radicalization . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

information investigated by german police at the time has resurfaced . it 's well-known that core elements of the plot were hatched among a radicalized muslim student group in hamburg , but newspapers in germany are reviving a report from an unlikely source linking another mosque in another german city .
monday , sept .
10 , 2001 , was a morning like most others in a kindergarten in the western german city of duisburg .
that is until a little boy named mustafa arrived .
he 'd been to his weekly koran study class at the mosque the day before and had heard something weird there , says a spokesperson for the kindergarten .
" even before he took his jacket off , he came to me and blurted out that he 'd come from arabic school , and that he 'd heard some grown-ups talking there .
they 'd said that a plane was going to hit a big building and that a lot of people would die . "
at the time , all she could think was that maybe mustafa had seen too much tv , or an especially explosive action movie .
but a day later , the little boy 's words haunted the kindergarten worker .
" after 9/11 , what he 'd said came back to me .
i am positive that what he told me , he told me on the 10th of september , one day before it all happened in the us . "
evidence suggests prior knowledge in duisburg bildunterschrift : needless to say , she went to the police .
and if the story at first sounds like a bit of conspiracy-mongering , recent reports in the german media include evidence which suggests the pieces of the jigsaw fit together to form a believable picture .
mustafa 's father was a regular visitor to a mosque known to hold radical meetings .
and police found a card from the mosque when they searched mohammed atta 's hamburg apartment after the attacks on sept .
11 .
also , in a number of households of people who attended the mosque , police found the date sept .
11 , 2001 , inscribed with an arabic notice which read : " the program ends . "
in the same calendars , six months before , on the date april 15 , was inscribed in arabic : the program begins . "
that date was later to be discovered as the day when many of the hijackers slipped into the us to begin final preparations for the attacks .
the man who gave these calendars out to friends at the mosque maintains , however , that the inscriptions are coincidental .
they refer to a savings plan , he says .
guantanamo inmate was a frequent visitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ould slahi has been held at guantanamo bay since 2001 another connection to the attacks lies in the person of mohamed ould slahi .
the mauritanian national , who has been in american custody at guantanamo since 2001 , studied electrical engineering in duisburg and was a frequent visitor to the mosque .
slahi is said to have helped atta recruit men to carry out the attacks .
it is now believed he might have been one of the men young mustafa heard talking on sept .
10 .
who those other men might have been and whether they are still living in germany remains unknown .
however , authorities in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is situated , have dismissed the link between the city and the 9/11 attacks , saying police had thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the year after the attack and did not consider it important .
" we do n't think the history of sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not known exactly how many have converted to islam in germany two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .
indeed , he says , such a program would be impossible to put in place because of the uncertainty around the number of converts in germany and the lack of a central register for them . but , pfaff says , ideas such as surveillance worry some german converts to islam who , unlike their turkish or other co-religionists from the middle east , have nowhere to go if the atmosphere for muslims in germany became intolerant and rights began to disappear . " turks could go back to turkey , i suppose , and egyptians to egypt , " he said .
" but for us converts , this is our home .
that 's why i have a special interest in seeing that our rights are protected . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany 's political parties in crisis germany 's political parties in crisis german parties begin early search for future partners expert says germany 's parties must reinvent themselves germany 's social democratic party struggles to redefine its role political parties -pipe- 11.09.2007 cdu puts new twist on conservative politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel recently called the cdu the " people 's party of the center " known for being a stalwart defender of conservative values , the christian democratic union has been leaning toward the center .
if the party ca n't agree on a common profile , it risks losing its majority . there 's something strange going on in berlin 's grand coalition of the traditionally conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and left-leaning social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
when milk prices recently rose , top politicians in the cdu was quick to demand increased subsidies for underprivileged families , while labor minister and spd member franz müntefering warned against excessive social spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's social wing came to the fore when milk prices increased the apparent switch was n't limited to milk , as the cdu has been having a difficult time defining a common party position on foreign and security policy matters . cdu experts , including foreign policy spokesman eckart von klaeden , insisted on restricting the german military 's involvement to afghanistan 's relatively safe northern region at the same time spd defense expert rainer arnold said he did n't exclude the possibility of sending military trainers to southern afghanistan , where the danger is significantly higher . reform pressure evaporates an economic upswing at home and unexpectedly high tax revenues seem to have put the brakes on domestic reform pressure .
halfway through her four-year term , chancellor angela merkel , who is also head of the cdu , was able to conclude that the government 's leadership was operating as she " had imagined it . " with the statement , merkel signaled that she would attempt to stay in power by maintaining her sober , compensatory leadership style . indeed , public opinion seems to attribute the country 's recent successes to the grand coalition and the chancellor , while more unpopular decisions - like raising the retirement age by two years to 67 - are ascribed to spd ministers . cdu rethinks its plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu is working to distinguish itself from its coalition partner aside from the restrictions that accompany sharing power with the party it has bitterly fought for decades , the cdu 's reorientation is a consequence of its 35 percent victory in the 2005 national elections .
from this near defeat , the union 's leaders quickly realized that they would n't find support for the radical market-reform plans they 'd agreed on at the party convention in leipzig that year . party leaders began altering their course and heading toward a more state-heavy , socially oriented democracy . today , the cdu comes across as being less ideological and closer to the people than the spd , which is still going through a process of self-discovery following former chancellor gerhard schröder 's " agenda 2010 " of labor market and social reforms . shaping its party profile for critics within the conservative camp , however , merkel has ruined her party 's core conservative profile and become a servant of berlin 's center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the coalition and party headed in different directions ?
amidst continual discussions over the new party platform , leading union politicians have warned their fellow party members of a loss of conservative values .
in their view , the middle-class vote can not be won without a conservative party profile . but the cdu 's search for an accent to its own profile within the grand coalition is a sensitive topic .
if party leaders tried to take a path that diverged from that of the governing coalition , they would open the door to doubts about their credibility and competence . the long , smoldering struggle between the conservatives and the free-market liberal fdp on the one side and the left-leaning members of the cdu on the other is likely to intensify during continued platform debates .
but finding the right balancing act between the two poles has become a hallmark for the cdu and a key reason behind its success . if merkel and co. are n't able to find a binding consensus it will increase the possibility of a clearly left-leaning administration taking over in germany the next time voters go to the polls in national elections . loay mudhoon -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 , 2001 , the us has tried - without success - to democratize the arab world with violence , writes dw 's miodrag soric .
as the bloodshed continues , it 's clear that democracy ca n't be forced . democracy ca n't be prescribed like cough syrup .
after the terror attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , george w. bush believed he could quickly " convert " several islamic states to the political system of the west .
with violence , if necessary .
six years later , it 's clear that this plan has failed .
every single day , innocent people are blown to pieces and the taliban spill blood in afghanistan .
the us is still looking for an adequate answer to sept .
11 .
what about the mastermind behind the attacks - osama bin laden ?
even if the arch-enemy were to be caught , that would n't mean the end of al qaeda .
bin laden has studied economics - and has apparently learned quite a lot about building organizations .
his " terror holding " encompasses dozens of states - from bosnia and yemen to pakistan and indonesia .
al qaeda adjusts to fit the circumstances .
it maintains an enormous supply of money and manpower .
and the fact that it has no central headquarters makes it all the more difficult to fight it .
al qaeda appeals to muslims all over the world .
can people be immunized against the sickness of fundamentalism ?
if so , how ?
even though the sept .
11 perpetrators and the terror suspects recently arrested in germany do n't necessarily fit the pattern , fundamentalism and radicalism tend to grow where there is poverty and a lack of prospects .
they flourish where people are uneducated .
the us troops are neither fighting poverty nor educating the people in the muslim world .
they are not even ensuring security .
and in iraq and afghanistan , as in other muslim countries , anti-american sentiment is growing .
bin laden turned the page on a new era with the 2001 attacks on the us .
political leaders throughout the world have realized that most of the muslim states are overwhelmed and ca n't even manage to provide the ever-growing masses of young men with bread and work .
many of the traditionally islamic countries do n't have competitive economies and their governments are corrupt .
as global competition increases , some feel like they have drawn the short end of the stick .
only a few arab states enjoy hefty profits from oil exports .
yet , even there , discontent with the political and social situation is increasing .
globalization seems to be making the world more complicated .
at least that 's what the media suggests .
the desire for simple answers to the muddle of world events is growing .
demagogues and those who speak in black-and-white - especially among religious leaders - are winning followers .
millions of people trust them , often wrongly .
education is desperately needed .
but it 's also tedious and time-consuming .
many politicians , including bush , hoped that violence would speed up success .
the reality has shown , however , that democracy ca n't be prescribed , not even inoculated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not known exactly how many have converted to islam in germany two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .
indeed , he says , such a program would be impossible to put in place because of the uncertainty around the number of converts in germany and the lack of a central register for them . but , pfaff says , ideas such as surveillance worry some german converts to islam who , unlike their turkish or other co-religionists from the middle east , have nowhere to go if the atmosphere for muslims in germany became intolerant and rights began to disappear . " turks could go back to turkey , i suppose , and egyptians to egypt , " he said .
" but for us converts , this is our home .
that 's why i have a special interest in seeing that our rights are protected . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , painted an encouraging picture of the situation in the country during a congressional hearing .
european papers think a miracle is needed . britain 's independent newspaper had the harshest words for the situation in iraq , saying that the latest increase in us troops " was never truly about stabilizing iraq .
the us had already lost the ability to control events on the ground when the troops began to pour in earlier this year .
its primary purpose was to stave off demands from democrats and some republicans for a timetable for a us troop withdrawal .
this is cynical and disgraceful .
but what else can we expect from a military adventure that was formed in a spirit of hubris and carried out in an atmosphere of crashing incompetence and reckless arrogance ?
the us-led occupation of iraq is unraveling in the same morally compromised manner in which it began . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger wrote that only a miracle could salvage the situation in iraq now .
" in essence , george w. bush 's vision of a democratic and secure iraq has probably failed , " it wrote .
" under the best of circumstances , the president can hope for an ' honorable peace ' like richard nixon in vietnam … the capitol hearings give the president … a window of about six months ; after that , at least five brigades will have to be withdrawn without replacement .
unless a political miracle happens in baghdad in the meantime , the regime in tehran will emerge as the victor of bush 's war because of its increased influence in iraq - and this without having spent half a trillion dollars , like washington 's warlord has . " vienna 's conservative daily die presse meanwhile cautioned people to remain open-minded about the possibility for improvement in iraq .
" it 's true : when the creator of the iraq fiasco , the american president , talks about ' signs of progress ' after a quick visit to iraq , the highest level of skepticism is called for .
this disastrous war that he started with lies will become his darkest chapter in history books in the future … but when independent reporters conclude after extensive research in the country that the security situation in several parts has improved , that the cooperation between americans , sunni leaders and iraqi security forces gets better and better - because the insurgents have gone too far with their anarchic terror against civilians - one should listen very carefully . " german business daily handelsblatt agreed that any calming of the situation represents progress .
" but compared to the original goals to turn iraq into a democratic role model for the middle east , the bar has been lowered dramatically .
washington now talks about a gentle division , about a sunnistan , shiistan and kurdistan , as if this would already signify a happy ending for iraq .
if there 's the slightest chance to prevent iraq from collapsing , it has to be pursued - no matter who will profit in terms of party politics in the us . " and the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote that it 's virtually impossible for bush to withdraw troops at this point .
" there 's no more talk about president bush 's intention to bring democracy to iraq and have it serve as an example for the arab and islamic world .
the only thing that matters now is what american soldiers can do to prevent a murderous civil war in the battered country , and whether they will continue to fight clan leaders and terrorists or withdraw and leave iraqis to deal with their own fate .
president bush can not approve a swift withdrawal , because this would not only symbolize a complete failure of his policy , but also make him responsible for a dangerous change of power relations in the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not known exactly how many have converted to islam in germany two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .
indeed , he says , such a program would be impossible to put in place because of the uncertainty around the number of converts in germany and the lack of a central register for them . but , pfaff says , ideas such as surveillance worry some german converts to islam who , unlike their turkish or other co-religionists from the middle east , have nowhere to go if the atmosphere for muslims in germany became intolerant and rights began to disappear . " turks could go back to turkey , i suppose , and egyptians to egypt , " he said .
" but for us converts , this is our home .
that 's why i have a special interest in seeing that our rights are protected . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , painted an encouraging picture of the situation in the country during a congressional hearing .
european papers think a miracle is needed . britain 's independent newspaper had the harshest words for the situation in iraq , saying that the latest increase in us troops " was never truly about stabilizing iraq .
the us had already lost the ability to control events on the ground when the troops began to pour in earlier this year .
its primary purpose was to stave off demands from democrats and some republicans for a timetable for a us troop withdrawal .
this is cynical and disgraceful .
but what else can we expect from a military adventure that was formed in a spirit of hubris and carried out in an atmosphere of crashing incompetence and reckless arrogance ?
the us-led occupation of iraq is unraveling in the same morally compromised manner in which it began . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger wrote that only a miracle could salvage the situation in iraq now .
" in essence , george w. bush 's vision of a democratic and secure iraq has probably failed , " it wrote .
" under the best of circumstances , the president can hope for an ' honorable peace ' like richard nixon in vietnam … the capitol hearings give the president … a window of about six months ; after that , at least five brigades will have to be withdrawn without replacement .
unless a political miracle happens in baghdad in the meantime , the regime in tehran will emerge as the victor of bush 's war because of its increased influence in iraq - and this without having spent half a trillion dollars , like washington 's warlord has . " vienna 's conservative daily die presse meanwhile cautioned people to remain open-minded about the possibility for improvement in iraq .
" it 's true : when the creator of the iraq fiasco , the american president , talks about ' signs of progress ' after a quick visit to iraq , the highest level of skepticism is called for .
this disastrous war that he started with lies will become his darkest chapter in history books in the future … but when independent reporters conclude after extensive research in the country that the security situation in several parts has improved , that the cooperation between americans , sunni leaders and iraqi security forces gets better and better - because the insurgents have gone too far with their anarchic terror against civilians - one should listen very carefully . " german business daily handelsblatt agreed that any calming of the situation represents progress .
" but compared to the original goals to turn iraq into a democratic role model for the middle east , the bar has been lowered dramatically .
washington now talks about a gentle division , about a sunnistan , shiistan and kurdistan , as if this would already signify a happy ending for iraq .
if there 's the slightest chance to prevent iraq from collapsing , it has to be pursued - no matter who will profit in terms of party politics in the us . " and the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote that it 's virtually impossible for bush to withdraw troops at this point .
" there 's no more talk about president bush 's intention to bring democracy to iraq and have it serve as an example for the arab and islamic world .
the only thing that matters now is what american soldiers can do to prevent a murderous civil war in the battered country , and whether they will continue to fight clan leaders and terrorists or withdraw and leave iraqis to deal with their own fate .
president bush can not approve a swift withdrawal , because this would not only symbolize a complete failure of his policy , but also make him responsible for a dangerous change of power relations in the middle east .

information investigated by german police at the time has resurfaced . it 's well-known that core elements of the plot were hatched among a radicalized muslim student group in hamburg , but newspapers in germany are reviving a report from an unlikely source linking another mosque in another german city .
monday , sept .
10 , 2001 , was a morning like most others in a kindergarten in the western german city of duisburg .
that is until a little boy named mustafa arrived .
he 'd been to his weekly koran study class at the mosque the day before and had heard something weird there , says a spokesperson for the kindergarten .
" even before he took his jacket off , he came to me and blurted out that he 'd come from arabic school , and that he 'd heard some grown-ups talking there .
they 'd said that a plane was going to hit a big building and that a lot of people would die . "
at the time , all she could think was that maybe mustafa had seen too much tv , or an especially explosive action movie .
but a day later , the little boy 's words haunted the kindergarten worker .
" after 9/11 , what he 'd said came back to me .
i am positive that what he told me , he told me on the 10th of september , one day before it all happened in the us . "
evidence suggests prior knowledge in duisburg bildunterschrift : needless to say , she went to the police .
and if the story at first sounds like a bit of conspiracy-mongering , recent reports in the german media include evidence which suggests the pieces of the jigsaw fit together to form a believable picture .
mustafa 's father was a regular visitor to a mosque known to hold radical meetings .
and police found a card from the mosque when they searched mohammed atta 's hamburg apartment after the attacks on sept .
11 .
also , in a number of households of people who attended the mosque , police found the date sept .
11 , 2001 , inscribed with an arabic notice which read : " the program ends . "
in the same calendars , six months before , on the date april 15 , was inscribed in arabic : the program begins . "
that date was later to be discovered as the day when many of the hijackers slipped into the us to begin final preparations for the attacks .
the man who gave these calendars out to friends at the mosque maintains , however , that the inscriptions are coincidental .
they refer to a savings plan , he says .
guantanamo inmate was a frequent visitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ould slahi has been held at guantanamo bay since 2001 another connection to the attacks lies in the person of mohamed ould slahi .
the mauritanian national , who has been in american custody at guantanamo since 2001 , studied electrical engineering in duisburg and was a frequent visitor to the mosque .
slahi is said to have helped atta recruit men to carry out the attacks .
it is now believed he might have been one of the men young mustafa heard talking on sept .
10 .
who those other men might have been and whether they are still living in germany remains unknown .
however , authorities in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is situated , have dismissed the link between the city and the 9/11 attacks , saying police had thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the year after the attack and did not consider it important .
" we do n't think the history of sept .
11 has to be completely rewritten because of this , " state interior ministry spokesman ludger harmeier told german press agency dpa . matt hermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , painted an encouraging picture of the situation in the country during a congressional hearing .
european papers think a miracle is needed . britain 's independent newspaper had the harshest words for the situation in iraq , saying that the latest increase in us troops " was never truly about stabilizing iraq .
the us had already lost the ability to control events on the ground when the troops began to pour in earlier this year .
its primary purpose was to stave off demands from democrats and some republicans for a timetable for a us troop withdrawal .
this is cynical and disgraceful .
but what else can we expect from a military adventure that was formed in a spirit of hubris and carried out in an atmosphere of crashing incompetence and reckless arrogance ?
the us-led occupation of iraq is unraveling in the same morally compromised manner in which it began . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger wrote that only a miracle could salvage the situation in iraq now .
" in essence , george w. bush 's vision of a democratic and secure iraq has probably failed , " it wrote .
" under the best of circumstances , the president can hope for an ' honorable peace ' like richard nixon in vietnam … the capitol hearings give the president … a window of about six months ; after that , at least five brigades will have to be withdrawn without replacement .
unless a political miracle happens in baghdad in the meantime , the regime in tehran will emerge as the victor of bush 's war because of its increased influence in iraq - and this without having spent half a trillion dollars , like washington 's warlord has . " vienna 's conservative daily die presse meanwhile cautioned people to remain open-minded about the possibility for improvement in iraq .
" it 's true : when the creator of the iraq fiasco , the american president , talks about ' signs of progress ' after a quick visit to iraq , the highest level of skepticism is called for .
this disastrous war that he started with lies will become his darkest chapter in history books in the future … but when independent reporters conclude after extensive research in the country that the security situation in several parts has improved , that the cooperation between americans , sunni leaders and iraqi security forces gets better and better - because the insurgents have gone too far with their anarchic terror against civilians - one should listen very carefully . " german business daily handelsblatt agreed that any calming of the situation represents progress .
" but compared to the original goals to turn iraq into a democratic role model for the middle east , the bar has been lowered dramatically .
washington now talks about a gentle division , about a sunnistan , shiistan and kurdistan , as if this would already signify a happy ending for iraq .
if there 's the slightest chance to prevent iraq from collapsing , it has to be pursued - no matter who will profit in terms of party politics in the us . " and the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote that it 's virtually impossible for bush to withdraw troops at this point .
" there 's no more talk about president bush 's intention to bring democracy to iraq and have it serve as an example for the arab and islamic world .
the only thing that matters now is what american soldiers can do to prevent a murderous civil war in the battered country , and whether they will continue to fight clan leaders and terrorists or withdraw and leave iraqis to deal with their own fate .
president bush can not approve a swift withdrawal , because this would not only symbolize a complete failure of his policy , but also make him responsible for a dangerous change of power relations in the middle east .

what about the mastermind behind the attacks - osama bin laden ?
even if the arch-enemy were to be caught , that would n't mean the end of al qaeda .
bin laden has studied economics - and has apparently learned quite a lot about building organizations .
his " terror holding " encompasses dozens of states - from bosnia and yemen to pakistan and indonesia .

11 perpetrators and the terror suspects recently arrested in germany do n't necessarily fit the pattern , fundamentalism and radicalism tend to grow where there is poverty and a lack of prospects .
they flourish where people are uneducated .
the us troops are neither fighting poverty nor educating the people in the muslim world .
they are not even ensuring security .
and in iraq and afghanistan , as in other muslim countries , anti-american sentiment is growing .
bin laden turned the page on a new era with the 2001 attacks on the us .
political leaders throughout the world have realized that most of the muslim states are overwhelmed and ca n't even manage to provide the ever-growing masses of young men with bread and work .
many of the traditionally islamic countries do n't have competitive economies and their governments are corrupt .

10 , painted an encouraging picture of the situation in the country during a congressional hearing .
european papers think a miracle is needed . britain 's independent newspaper had the harshest words for the situation in iraq , saying that the latest increase in us troops " was never truly about stabilizing iraq .
the us had already lost the ability to control events on the ground when the troops began to pour in earlier this year .
its primary purpose was to stave off demands from democrats and some republicans for a timetable for a us troop withdrawal .
this is cynical and disgraceful .
but what else can we expect from a military adventure that was formed in a spirit of hubris and carried out in an atmosphere of crashing incompetence and reckless arrogance ?
the us-led occupation of iraq is unraveling in the same morally compromised manner in which it began . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger wrote that only a miracle could salvage the situation in iraq now .
" in essence , george w. bush 's vision of a democratic and secure iraq has probably failed , " it wrote .
" under the best of circumstances , the president can hope for an ' honorable peace ' like richard nixon in vietnam … the capitol hearings give the president … a window of about six months ; after that , at least five brigades will have to be withdrawn without replacement .
unless a political miracle happens in baghdad in the meantime , the regime in tehran will emerge as the victor of bush 's war because of its increased influence in iraq - and this without having spent half a trillion dollars , like washington 's warlord has . " vienna 's conservative daily die presse meanwhile cautioned people to remain open-minded about the possibility for improvement in iraq .
" it 's true : when the creator of the iraq fiasco , the american president , talks about ' signs of progress ' after a quick visit to iraq , the highest level of skepticism is called for .
this disastrous war that he started with lies will become his darkest chapter in history books in the future … but when independent reporters conclude after extensive research in the country that the security situation in several parts has improved , that the cooperation between americans , sunni leaders and iraqi security forces gets better and better - because the insurgents have gone too far with their anarchic terror against civilians - one should listen very carefully . " german business daily handelsblatt agreed that any calming of the situation represents progress .
" but compared to the original goals to turn iraq into a democratic role model for the middle east , the bar has been lowered dramatically .
washington now talks about a gentle division , about a sunnistan , shiistan and kurdistan , as if this would already signify a happy ending for iraq .
if there 's the slightest chance to prevent iraq from collapsing , it has to be pursued - no matter who will profit in terms of party politics in the us . " and the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote that it 's virtually impossible for bush to withdraw troops at this point .
" there 's no more talk about president bush 's intention to bring democracy to iraq and have it serve as an example for the arab and islamic world .
the only thing that matters now is what american soldiers can do to prevent a murderous civil war in the battered country , and whether they will continue to fight clan leaders and terrorists or withdraw and leave iraqis to deal with their own fate .
president bush can not approve a swift withdrawal , because this would not only symbolize a complete failure of his policy , but also make him responsible for a dangerous change of power relations in the middle east .

the us-led occupation of iraq is unraveling in the same morally compromised manner in which it began . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger wrote that only a miracle could salvage the situation in iraq now .

" under the best of circumstances , the president can hope for an ' honorable peace ' like richard nixon in vietnam … the capitol hearings give the president … a window of about six months ; after that , at least five brigades will have to be withdrawn without replacement .
unless a political miracle happens in baghdad in the meantime , the regime in tehran will emerge as the victor of bush 's war because of its increased influence in iraq - and this without having spent half a trillion dollars , like washington 's warlord has .

" it 's true : when the creator of the iraq fiasco , the american president , talks about ' signs of progress ' after a quick visit to iraq , the highest level of skepticism is called for .
this disastrous war that he started with lies will become his darkest chapter in history books in the future … but when independent reporters conclude after extensive research in the country that the security situation in several parts has improved , that the cooperation between americans , sunni leaders and iraqi security forces gets better and better - because the insurgents have gone too far with their anarchic terror against civilians - one should listen very carefully . " german business daily handelsblatt agreed that any calming of the situation represents progress .
" but compared to the original goals to turn iraq into a democratic role model for the middle east , the bar has been lowered dramatically .
washington now talks about a gentle division , about a sunnistan , shiistan and kurdistan , as if this would already signify a happy ending for iraq .
if there 's the slightest chance to prevent iraq from collapsing , it has to be pursued - no matter who will profit in terms of party politics in the us . " and the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote that it 's virtually impossible for bush to withdraw troops at this point .
" there 's no more talk about president bush 's intention to bring democracy to iraq and have it serve as an example for the arab and islamic world .
the only thing that matters now is what american soldiers can do to prevent a murderous civil war in the battered country , and whether they will continue to fight clan leaders and terrorists or withdraw and leave iraqis to deal with their own fate .
president bush can not approve a swift withdrawal , because this would not only symbolize a complete failure of his policy , but also make him responsible for a dangerous change of power relations in the middle east .

11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .

11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .
the risk is still there . elisabeth otto interviewed tim van beveren -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

information investigated by german police at the time has resurfaced . it 's well-known that core elements of the plot were hatched among a radicalized muslim student group in hamburg , but newspapers in germany are reviving a report from an unlikely source linking another mosque in another german city .
monday , sept .
10 , 2001 , was a morning like most others in a kindergarten in the western german city of duisburg .
that is until a little boy named mustafa arrived .
he 'd been to his weekly koran study class at the mosque the day before and had heard something weird there , says a spokesperson for the kindergarten .
" even before he took his jacket off , he came to me and blurted out that he 'd come from arabic school , and that he 'd heard some grown-ups talking there .
they 'd said that a plane was going to hit a big building and that a lot of people would die . "
at the time , all she could think was that maybe mustafa had seen too much tv , or an especially explosive action movie .
but a day later , the little boy 's words haunted the kindergarten worker .
" after 9/11 , what he 'd said came back to me .
i am positive that what he told me , he told me on the 10th of september , one day before it all happened in the us . "
evidence suggests prior knowledge in duisburg bildunterschrift : needless to say , she went to the police .
and if the story at first sounds like a bit of conspiracy-mongering , recent reports in the german media include evidence which suggests the pieces of the jigsaw fit together to form a believable picture .
mustafa 's father was a regular visitor to a mosque known to hold radical meetings .
and police found a card from the mosque when they searched mohammed atta 's hamburg apartment after the attacks on sept .
11 .
also , in a number of households of people who attended the mosque , police found the date sept .
11 , 2001 , inscribed with an arabic notice which read : " the program ends . "
in the same calendars , six months before , on the date april 15 , was inscribed in arabic : the program begins . "
that date was later to be discovered as the day when many of the hijackers slipped into the us to begin final preparations for the attacks .
the man who gave these calendars out to friends at the mosque maintains , however , that the inscriptions are coincidental .
they refer to a savings plan , he says .
guantanamo inmate was a frequent visitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ould slahi has been held at guantanamo bay since 2001 another connection to the attacks lies in the person of mohamed ould slahi .
the mauritanian national , who has been in american custody at guantanamo since 2001 , studied electrical engineering in duisburg and was a frequent visitor to the mosque .
slahi is said to have helped atta recruit men to carry out the attacks .
it is now believed he might have been one of the men young mustafa heard talking on sept .
10 .
who those other men might have been and whether they are still living in germany remains unknown .
however , authorities in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is situated , have dismissed the link between the city and the 9/11 attacks , saying police had thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the year after the attack and did not consider it important .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not known exactly how many have converted to islam in germany two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .
indeed , he says , such a program would be impossible to put in place because of the uncertainty around the number of converts in germany and the lack of a central register for them . but , pfaff says , ideas such as surveillance worry some german converts to islam who , unlike their turkish or other co-religionists from the middle east , have nowhere to go if the atmosphere for muslims in germany became intolerant and rights began to disappear . " turks could go back to turkey , i suppose , and egyptians to egypt , " he said .
" but for us converts , this is our home .
that 's why i have a special interest in seeing that our rights are protected . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .
indeed , he says , such a program would be impossible to put in place because of the uncertainty around the number of converts in germany and the lack of a central register for them . but , pfaff says , ideas such as surveillance worry some german converts to islam who , unlike their turkish or other co-religionists from the middle east , have nowhere to go if the atmosphere for muslims in germany became intolerant and rights began to disappear . " turks could go back to turkey , i suppose , and egyptians to egypt , " he said .

that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .
indeed , he says , such a program would be impossible to put in place because of the uncertainty around the number of converts in germany and the lack of a central register for them . but , pfaff says , ideas such as surveillance worry some german converts to islam who , unlike their turkish or other co-religionists from the middle east , have nowhere to go if the atmosphere for muslims in germany became intolerant and rights began to disappear . " turks could go back to turkey , i suppose , and egyptians to egypt , " he said .
" but for us converts , this is our home .
that 's why i have a special interest in seeing that our rights are protected . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ministry said officials believed the claim , made on a web site , was authentic and that it fitted in with their investigations . " the acknowledgement emphasizes the continuing threat of islamist terrorism , " the ministry said . group planning " massive attacks " news of the islamic jihad union 's involvement comes days after german authorities arrested three men in connection with what officials say was a foiled plan to bomb us sites in germany .
the police said the attacks could have caused even worse carnage than bomb attacks in madrid or london in recent years . federal prosecutor monika harms said the cell was planning " massive " attacks . " german authorities said the men arrested - two german converts to islam and a turk - had trained in militant camps in pakistan before forming a domestic cell of the islamic jihad union which has its roots in uzbekistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canisters of hydrogen peroxide that were seized by security forces from those arrested officials said the suspects had collected massive quantities of hydrogen peroxide .
that same household chemical was used by suicide bombers in the 2005 london public transport attacks that killed 56 people . biggest security operation jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , said last week that the islamic jihad union had ties to the al qaeda terrorist network and that the men accused of planning the attacks in germany were " driven by a hatred of us citizens .

11 , 2001 , the us has tried - without success - to democratize the arab world with violence , writes dw 's miodrag soric .
as the bloodshed continues , it 's clear that democracy ca n't be forced . democracy ca n't be prescribed like cough syrup .
after the terror attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , george w. bush believed he could quickly " convert " several islamic states to the political system of the west .
with violence , if necessary .
six years later , it 's clear that this plan has failed .
every single day , innocent people are blown to pieces and the taliban spill blood in afghanistan .
the us is still looking for an adequate answer to sept .
11 .
what about the mastermind behind the attacks - osama bin laden ?
even if the arch-enemy were to be caught , that would n't mean the end of al qaeda .
bin laden has studied economics - and has apparently learned quite a lot about building organizations .
his " terror holding " encompasses dozens of states - from bosnia and yemen to pakistan and indonesia .
al qaeda adjusts to fit the circumstances .
it maintains an enormous supply of money and manpower .
and the fact that it has no central headquarters makes it all the more difficult to fight it .
al qaeda appeals to muslims all over the world .
can people be immunized against the sickness of fundamentalism ?
if so , how ?
even though the sept .
11 perpetrators and the terror suspects recently arrested in germany do n't necessarily fit the pattern , fundamentalism and radicalism tend to grow where there is poverty and a lack of prospects .
they flourish where people are uneducated .
the us troops are neither fighting poverty nor educating the people in the muslim world .
they are not even ensuring security .
and in iraq and afghanistan , as in other muslim countries , anti-american sentiment is growing .
bin laden turned the page on a new era with the 2001 attacks on the us .
political leaders throughout the world have realized that most of the muslim states are overwhelmed and ca n't even manage to provide the ever-growing masses of young men with bread and work .
many of the traditionally islamic countries do n't have competitive economies and their governments are corrupt .
as global competition increases , some feel like they have drawn the short end of the stick .
only a few arab states enjoy hefty profits from oil exports .
yet , even there , discontent with the political and social situation is increasing .
globalization seems to be making the world more complicated .
at least that 's what the media suggests .
the desire for simple answers to the muddle of world events is growing .
demagogues and those who speak in black-and-white - especially among religious leaders - are winning followers .
millions of people trust them , often wrongly .
education is desperately needed .
but it 's also tedious and time-consuming .
many politicians , including bush , hoped that violence would speed up success .
the reality has shown , however , that democracy ca n't be prescribed , not even inoculated .

when milk prices recently rose , top politicians in the cdu was quick to demand increased subsidies for underprivileged families , while labor minister and spd member franz müntefering warned against excessive social spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's social wing came to the fore when milk prices increased the apparent switch was n't limited to milk , as the cdu has been having a difficult time defining a common party position on foreign and security policy matters . cdu experts , including foreign policy spokesman eckart von klaeden , insisted on restricting the german military 's involvement to afghanistan 's relatively safe northern region at the same time spd defense expert rainer arnold said he did n't exclude the possibility of sending military trainers to southern afghanistan , where the danger is significantly higher . reform pressure evaporates an economic upswing at home and unexpectedly high tax revenues seem to have put the brakes on domestic reform pressure .
halfway through her four-year term , chancellor angela merkel , who is also head of the cdu , was able to conclude that the government 's leadership was operating as she " had imagined it . " with the statement , merkel signaled that she would attempt to stay in power by maintaining her sober , compensatory leadership style . indeed , public opinion seems to attribute the country 's recent successes to the grand coalition and the chancellor , while more unpopular decisions - like raising the retirement age by two years to 67 - are ascribed to spd ministers . cdu rethinks its plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu is working to distinguish itself from its coalition partner aside from the restrictions that accompany sharing power with the party it has bitterly fought for decades , the cdu 's reorientation is a consequence of its 35 percent victory in the 2005 national elections .
from this near defeat , the union 's leaders quickly realized that they would n't find support for the radical market-reform plans they 'd agreed on at the party convention in leipzig that year . party leaders began altering their course and heading toward a more state-heavy , socially oriented democracy . today , the cdu comes across as being less ideological and closer to the people than the spd , which is still going through a process of self-discovery following former chancellor gerhard schröder 's " agenda 2010 " of labor market and social reforms . shaping its party profile for critics within the conservative camp , however , merkel has ruined her party 's core conservative profile and become a servant of berlin 's center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the coalition and party headed in different directions ?
amidst continual discussions over the new party platform , leading union politicians have warned their fellow party members of a loss of conservative values .
in their view , the middle-class vote can not be won without a conservative party profile . but the cdu 's search for an accent to its own profile within the grand coalition is a sensitive topic .
if party leaders tried to take a path that diverged from that of the governing coalition , they would open the door to doubts about their credibility and competence . the long , smoldering struggle between the conservatives and the free-market liberal fdp on the one side and the left-leaning members of the cdu on the other is likely to intensify during continued platform debates .
but finding the right balancing act between the two poles has become a hallmark for the cdu and a key reason behind its success . if merkel and co. are n't able to find a binding consensus it will increase the possibility of a clearly left-leaning administration taking over in germany the next time voters go to the polls in national elections . loay mudhoon -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

halfway through her four-year term , chancellor angela merkel , who is also head of the cdu , was able to conclude that the government 's leadership was operating as she " had imagined it .

amidst continual discussions over the new party platform , leading union politicians have warned their fellow party members of a loss of conservative values .
in their view , the middle-class vote can not be won without a conservative party profile . but the cdu 's search for an accent to its own profile within the grand coalition is a sensitive topic .
if party leaders tried to take a path that diverged from that of the governing coalition , they would open the door to doubts about their credibility and competence . the long , smoldering struggle between the conservatives and the free-market liberal fdp on the one side and the left-leaning members of the cdu on the other is likely to intensify during continued platform debates .
but finding the right balancing act between the two poles has become a hallmark for the cdu and a key reason behind its success . if merkel and co. are n't able to find a binding consensus it will increase the possibility of a clearly left-leaning administration taking over in germany the next time voters go to the polls in national elections . loay mudhoon -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 aviation security expert says 9/11 changed nature of hijackings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim van beveren says tactics for hijacking planes have changed since sept .
11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .
the risk is still there . elisabeth otto interviewed tim van beveren -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .

what about the mastermind behind the attacks - osama bin laden ?
even if the arch-enemy were to be caught , that would n't mean the end of al qaeda .

his " terror holding " encompasses dozens of states - from bosnia and yemen to pakistan and indonesia .

even though the sept .
11 perpetrators and the terror suspects recently arrested in germany do n't necessarily fit the pattern , fundamentalism and radicalism tend to grow where there is poverty and a lack of prospects .

they are not even ensuring security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany 's political parties in crisis germany 's political parties in crisis german parties begin early search for future partners expert says germany 's parties must reinvent themselves germany 's social democratic party struggles to redefine its role political parties -pipe- 11.09.2007 cdu puts new twist on conservative politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel recently called the cdu the " people 's party of the center " known for being a stalwart defender of conservative values , the christian democratic union has been leaning toward the center .
if the party ca n't agree on a common profile , it risks losing its majority . there 's something strange going on in berlin 's grand coalition of the traditionally conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and left-leaning social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
when milk prices recently rose , top politicians in the cdu was quick to demand increased subsidies for underprivileged families , while labor minister and spd member franz müntefering warned against excessive social spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's social wing came to the fore when milk prices increased the apparent switch was n't limited to milk , as the cdu has been having a difficult time defining a common party position on foreign and security policy matters . cdu experts , including foreign policy spokesman eckart von klaeden , insisted on restricting the german military 's involvement to afghanistan 's relatively safe northern region at the same time spd defense expert rainer arnold said he did n't exclude the possibility of sending military trainers to southern afghanistan , where the danger is significantly higher . reform pressure evaporates an economic upswing at home and unexpectedly high tax revenues seem to have put the brakes on domestic reform pressure .
halfway through her four-year term , chancellor angela merkel , who is also head of the cdu , was able to conclude that the government 's leadership was operating as she " had imagined it . " with the statement , merkel signaled that she would attempt to stay in power by maintaining her sober , compensatory leadership style . indeed , public opinion seems to attribute the country 's recent successes to the grand coalition and the chancellor , while more unpopular decisions - like raising the retirement age by two years to 67 - are ascribed to spd ministers . cdu rethinks its plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu is working to distinguish itself from its coalition partner aside from the restrictions that accompany sharing power with the party it has bitterly fought for decades , the cdu 's reorientation is a consequence of its 35 percent victory in the 2005 national elections .
from this near defeat , the union 's leaders quickly realized that they would n't find support for the radical market-reform plans they 'd agreed on at the party convention in leipzig that year . party leaders began altering their course and heading toward a more state-heavy , socially oriented democracy . today , the cdu comes across as being less ideological and closer to the people than the spd , which is still going through a process of self-discovery following former chancellor gerhard schröder 's " agenda 2010 " of labor market and social reforms . shaping its party profile for critics within the conservative camp , however , merkel has ruined her party 's core conservative profile and become a servant of berlin 's center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the coalition and party headed in different directions ?
amidst continual discussions over the new party platform , leading union politicians have warned their fellow party members of a loss of conservative values .
in their view , the middle-class vote can not be won without a conservative party profile . but the cdu 's search for an accent to its own profile within the grand coalition is a sensitive topic .
if party leaders tried to take a path that diverged from that of the governing coalition , they would open the door to doubts about their credibility and competence . the long , smoldering struggle between the conservatives and the free-market liberal fdp on the one side and the left-leaning members of the cdu on the other is likely to intensify during continued platform debates .
but finding the right balancing act between the two poles has become a hallmark for the cdu and a key reason behind its success . if merkel and co. are n't able to find a binding consensus it will increase the possibility of a clearly left-leaning administration taking over in germany the next time voters go to the polls in national elections . loay mudhoon -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , painted an encouraging picture of the situation in the country during a congressional hearing .
european papers think a miracle is needed . britain 's independent newspaper had the harshest words for the situation in iraq , saying that the latest increase in us troops " was never truly about stabilizing iraq .
the us had already lost the ability to control events on the ground when the troops began to pour in earlier this year .
its primary purpose was to stave off demands from democrats and some republicans for a timetable for a us troop withdrawal .
this is cynical and disgraceful .
but what else can we expect from a military adventure that was formed in a spirit of hubris and carried out in an atmosphere of crashing incompetence and reckless arrogance ?
the us-led occupation of iraq is unraveling in the same morally compromised manner in which it began . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger wrote that only a miracle could salvage the situation in iraq now .
" in essence , george w. bush 's vision of a democratic and secure iraq has probably failed , " it wrote .
" under the best of circumstances , the president can hope for an ' honorable peace ' like richard nixon in vietnam … the capitol hearings give the president … a window of about six months ; after that , at least five brigades will have to be withdrawn without replacement .
unless a political miracle happens in baghdad in the meantime , the regime in tehran will emerge as the victor of bush 's war because of its increased influence in iraq - and this without having spent half a trillion dollars , like washington 's warlord has . " vienna 's conservative daily die presse meanwhile cautioned people to remain open-minded about the possibility for improvement in iraq .
" it 's true : when the creator of the iraq fiasco , the american president , talks about ' signs of progress ' after a quick visit to iraq , the highest level of skepticism is called for .
this disastrous war that he started with lies will become his darkest chapter in history books in the future … but when independent reporters conclude after extensive research in the country that the security situation in several parts has improved , that the cooperation between americans , sunni leaders and iraqi security forces gets better and better - because the insurgents have gone too far with their anarchic terror against civilians - one should listen very carefully . " german business daily handelsblatt agreed that any calming of the situation represents progress .
" but compared to the original goals to turn iraq into a democratic role model for the middle east , the bar has been lowered dramatically .
washington now talks about a gentle division , about a sunnistan , shiistan and kurdistan , as if this would already signify a happy ending for iraq .
if there 's the slightest chance to prevent iraq from collapsing , it has to be pursued - no matter who will profit in terms of party politics in the us . " and the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote that it 's virtually impossible for bush to withdraw troops at this point .
" there 's no more talk about president bush 's intention to bring democracy to iraq and have it serve as an example for the arab and islamic world .
the only thing that matters now is what american soldiers can do to prevent a murderous civil war in the battered country , and whether they will continue to fight clan leaders and terrorists or withdraw and leave iraqis to deal with their own fate .
president bush can not approve a swift withdrawal , because this would not only symbolize a complete failure of his policy , but also make him responsible for a dangerous change of power relations in the middle east .

11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .
the risk is still there . elisabeth otto interviewed tim van beveren -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

information investigated by german police at the time has resurfaced . it 's well-known that core elements of the plot were hatched among a radicalized muslim student group in hamburg , but newspapers in germany are reviving a report from an unlikely source linking another mosque in another german city .
monday , sept .
10 , 2001 , was a morning like most others in a kindergarten in the western german city of duisburg .
that is until a little boy named mustafa arrived .
he 'd been to his weekly koran study class at the mosque the day before and had heard something weird there , says a spokesperson for the kindergarten .
" even before he took his jacket off , he came to me and blurted out that he 'd come from arabic school , and that he 'd heard some grown-ups talking there .
they 'd said that a plane was going to hit a big building and that a lot of people would die . "
at the time , all she could think was that maybe mustafa had seen too much tv , or an especially explosive action movie .
but a day later , the little boy 's words haunted the kindergarten worker .
" after 9/11 , what he 'd said came back to me .
i am positive that what he told me , he told me on the 10th of september , one day before it all happened in the us . "
evidence suggests prior knowledge in duisburg bildunterschrift : needless to say , she went to the police .
and if the story at first sounds like a bit of conspiracy-mongering , recent reports in the german media include evidence which suggests the pieces of the jigsaw fit together to form a believable picture .
mustafa 's father was a regular visitor to a mosque known to hold radical meetings .
and police found a card from the mosque when they searched mohammed atta 's hamburg apartment after the attacks on sept .
11 .
also , in a number of households of people who attended the mosque , police found the date sept .
11 , 2001 , inscribed with an arabic notice which read : " the program ends . "
in the same calendars , six months before , on the date april 15 , was inscribed in arabic : the program begins . "
that date was later to be discovered as the day when many of the hijackers slipped into the us to begin final preparations for the attacks .
the man who gave these calendars out to friends at the mosque maintains , however , that the inscriptions are coincidental .
they refer to a savings plan , he says .
guantanamo inmate was a frequent visitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ould slahi has been held at guantanamo bay since 2001 another connection to the attacks lies in the person of mohamed ould slahi .
the mauritanian national , who has been in american custody at guantanamo since 2001 , studied electrical engineering in duisburg and was a frequent visitor to the mosque .
slahi is said to have helped atta recruit men to carry out the attacks .
it is now believed he might have been one of the men young mustafa heard talking on sept .
10 .
who those other men might have been and whether they are still living in germany remains unknown .
however , authorities in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is situated , have dismissed the link between the city and the 9/11 attacks , saying police had thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the year after the attack and did not consider it important .

it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .
indeed , he says , such a program would be impossible to put in place because of the uncertainty around the number of converts in germany and the lack of a central register for them . but , pfaff says , ideas such as surveillance worry some german converts to islam who , unlike their turkish or other co-religionists from the middle east , have nowhere to go if the atmosphere for muslims in germany became intolerant and rights began to disappear . " turks could go back to turkey , i suppose , and egyptians to egypt , " he said .
" but for us converts , this is our home .
that 's why i have a special interest in seeing that our rights are protected . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not known exactly how many have converted to islam in germany two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .
indeed , he says , such a program would be impossible to put in place because of the uncertainty around the number of converts in germany and the lack of a central register for them . but , pfaff says , ideas such as surveillance worry some german converts to islam who , unlike their turkish or other co-religionists from the middle east , have nowhere to go if the atmosphere for muslims in germany became intolerant and rights began to disappear . " turks could go back to turkey , i suppose , and egyptians to egypt , " he said .
" but for us converts , this is our home .
that 's why i have a special interest in seeing that our rights are protected . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if the party ca n't agree on a common profile , it risks losing its majority . there 's something strange going on in berlin 's grand coalition of the traditionally conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and left-leaning social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
when milk prices recently rose , top politicians in the cdu was quick to demand increased subsidies for underprivileged families , while labor minister and spd member franz müntefering warned against excessive social spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's social wing came to the fore when milk prices increased the apparent switch was n't limited to milk , as the cdu has been having a difficult time defining a common party position on foreign and security policy matters . cdu experts , including foreign policy spokesman eckart von klaeden , insisted on restricting the german military 's involvement to afghanistan 's relatively safe northern region at the same time spd defense expert rainer arnold said he did n't exclude the possibility of sending military trainers to southern afghanistan , where the danger is significantly higher . reform pressure evaporates an economic upswing at home and unexpectedly high tax revenues seem to have put the brakes on domestic reform pressure .
halfway through her four-year term , chancellor angela merkel , who is also head of the cdu , was able to conclude that the government 's leadership was operating as she " had imagined it . " with the statement , merkel signaled that she would attempt to stay in power by maintaining her sober , compensatory leadership style . indeed , public opinion seems to attribute the country 's recent successes to the grand coalition and the chancellor , while more unpopular decisions - like raising the retirement age by two years to 67 - are ascribed to spd ministers . cdu rethinks its plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu is working to distinguish itself from its coalition partner aside from the restrictions that accompany sharing power with the party it has bitterly fought for decades , the cdu 's reorientation is a consequence of its 35 percent victory in the 2005 national elections .
from this near defeat , the union 's leaders quickly realized that they would n't find support for the radical market-reform plans they 'd agreed on at the party convention in leipzig that year . party leaders began altering their course and heading toward a more state-heavy , socially oriented democracy . today , the cdu comes across as being less ideological and closer to the people than the spd , which is still going through a process of self-discovery following former chancellor gerhard schröder 's " agenda 2010 " of labor market and social reforms . shaping its party profile for critics within the conservative camp , however , merkel has ruined her party 's core conservative profile and become a servant of berlin 's center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the coalition and party headed in different directions ?
amidst continual discussions over the new party platform , leading union politicians have warned their fellow party members of a loss of conservative values .
in their view , the middle-class vote can not be won without a conservative party profile . but the cdu 's search for an accent to its own profile within the grand coalition is a sensitive topic .
if party leaders tried to take a path that diverged from that of the governing coalition , they would open the door to doubts about their credibility and competence . the long , smoldering struggle between the conservatives and the free-market liberal fdp on the one side and the left-leaning members of the cdu on the other is likely to intensify during continued platform debates .
but finding the right balancing act between the two poles has become a hallmark for the cdu and a key reason behind its success . if merkel and co. are n't able to find a binding consensus it will increase the possibility of a clearly left-leaning administration taking over in germany the next time voters go to the polls in national elections . loay mudhoon -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 aviation security expert says 9/11 changed nature of hijackings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim van beveren says tactics for hijacking planes have changed since sept .
11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .
the risk is still there . elisabeth otto interviewed tim van beveren -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany 's political parties in crisis germany 's political parties in crisis german parties begin early search for future partners expert says germany 's parties must reinvent themselves germany 's social democratic party struggles to redefine its role political parties -pipe- 11.09.2007 cdu puts new twist on conservative politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel recently called the cdu the " people 's party of the center " known for being a stalwart defender of conservative values , the christian democratic union has been leaning toward the center .
if the party ca n't agree on a common profile , it risks losing its majority . there 's something strange going on in berlin 's grand coalition of the traditionally conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and left-leaning social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
when milk prices recently rose , top politicians in the cdu was quick to demand increased subsidies for underprivileged families , while labor minister and spd member franz müntefering warned against excessive social spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's social wing came to the fore when milk prices increased the apparent switch was n't limited to milk , as the cdu has been having a difficult time defining a common party position on foreign and security policy matters . cdu experts , including foreign policy spokesman eckart von klaeden , insisted on restricting the german military 's involvement to afghanistan 's relatively safe northern region at the same time spd defense expert rainer arnold said he did n't exclude the possibility of sending military trainers to southern afghanistan , where the danger is significantly higher . reform pressure evaporates an economic upswing at home and unexpectedly high tax revenues seem to have put the brakes on domestic reform pressure .
halfway through her four-year term , chancellor angela merkel , who is also head of the cdu , was able to conclude that the government 's leadership was operating as she " had imagined it . " with the statement , merkel signaled that she would attempt to stay in power by maintaining her sober , compensatory leadership style . indeed , public opinion seems to attribute the country 's recent successes to the grand coalition and the chancellor , while more unpopular decisions - like raising the retirement age by two years to 67 - are ascribed to spd ministers . cdu rethinks its plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu is working to distinguish itself from its coalition partner aside from the restrictions that accompany sharing power with the party it has bitterly fought for decades , the cdu 's reorientation is a consequence of its 35 percent victory in the 2005 national elections .
from this near defeat , the union 's leaders quickly realized that they would n't find support for the radical market-reform plans they 'd agreed on at the party convention in leipzig that year . party leaders began altering their course and heading toward a more state-heavy , socially oriented democracy . today , the cdu comes across as being less ideological and closer to the people than the spd , which is still going through a process of self-discovery following former chancellor gerhard schröder 's " agenda 2010 " of labor market and social reforms . shaping its party profile for critics within the conservative camp , however , merkel has ruined her party 's core conservative profile and become a servant of berlin 's center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the coalition and party headed in different directions ?
amidst continual discussions over the new party platform , leading union politicians have warned their fellow party members of a loss of conservative values .
in their view , the middle-class vote can not be won without a conservative party profile . but the cdu 's search for an accent to its own profile within the grand coalition is a sensitive topic .
if party leaders tried to take a path that diverged from that of the governing coalition , they would open the door to doubts about their credibility and competence . the long , smoldering struggle between the conservatives and the free-market liberal fdp on the one side and the left-leaning members of the cdu on the other is likely to intensify during continued platform debates .
but finding the right balancing act between the two poles has become a hallmark for the cdu and a key reason behind its success . if merkel and co. are n't able to find a binding consensus it will increase the possibility of a clearly left-leaning administration taking over in germany the next time voters go to the polls in national elections . loay mudhoon -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he said over 300 police officers had been monitoring the suspects over six months , and that it was one of the largest police operations of its kind in germany .
security forces decided to move in on the suspects last week when it became clear the three had begun creating bombs . news of the arrests of the homegrown terrorists have shaken germany and reignited debate over tightening security measures and better integrating its minority muslim population . the fact that two of the suspects are german converts to islam has also raised questions over whether converts to islam are more susceptible to radicalization . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in keeping with the show 's theme " see what will move your future , " sustainable mobility includes a drastic cut in fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions .
but , gm 's european president , carl-peter foster , said that automakers would probably rely on a variety of solutions to make automobilies more environment-compatible . alternative fuels may play bigger role " i think that basically what you will see is a competition of various technologies and ultimately the one that best suits the needs " of specific segments will win , foster told reporters . " i think that alternative fuels have to play a larger role , " he said . toyota , however , has paved the wave in going green , with its prius hybrid the leader in the industry .

" we 're not just alking about cutting co2 emissions , we 're doing it , " bmw chief executive norbert reithofer told ap news agency . bmw says china copycats cars bmw , however , has had to shift gears when it comes to marketing its models . even before the motor show began , the company had locked horns with chinese automaker shuanghuan .
bmw said the chinese-made four-wheel-drive ceo was a replica of its x5 model , which it stopped producing last year . but , karl schössl , head of china automobile deutschland , the company that imports shuanghuan 's cars , said he was not concerned about pressure from bmw . bildunterschrift : citroen 's new , green " c-cactus " vehicle he told afp at the car show in frankfurt : " i am absolutely not worried " about the possiblity of cars being seized by officials . bmw said last friday that it had launched legal proceedings against the importer due to possible copyright infringements . shuanghaun 's vehicles still on show but , two different versions of the shuanghaun car went on display anyway in frankfurt , and bmw said it did not plan to have the models confiscated . " we are not planning anything tomorrow -lsb- wednesday -rsb- at 9 a.m. , " a bmw spokesman told afp news agency , though he did not rule out further action . schlössl claimed that german automakers wanted to keep chinese companies away from the european market . daimlerchrysler had also taken issue with shuanghaun , saying its noble car was a copy of daimler 's smart city car .
the noble did not go on display in frankfurt . more than 1,000 companies from around 40 countries are showing their goods at frankfurt 's international motor show , which will open to the public on saturday , sept .

german and chinese automakers also locked horns over an alleged copycat vehicle . green is all the rage when it comes to vehicles these days .
nearly every automaker showing cars at the international motor show in frankfurt had an " eco-friendly " version to introduce when the trade fair opened to the press on tuesday , sept .
11 . new models on display boasted improved fuel efficiency and engines that run on batteries or hydrogen . bildunterschrift : even former formula one ferrari driver michael schumacher -lrb- l -rrb- showed up in frankfurt ; here , with ferrari ceo luca di montezemolo us automaker giant general motors also unveiled new designs that rely on sustainable mobility .
in keeping with the show 's theme " see what will move your future , " sustainable mobility includes a drastic cut in fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions .
but , gm 's european president , carl-peter foster , said that automakers would probably rely on a variety of solutions to make automobilies more environment-compatible . alternative fuels may play bigger role " i think that basically what you will see is a competition of various technologies and ultimately the one that best suits the needs " of specific segments will win , foster told reporters . " i think that alternative fuels have to play a larger role , " he said . toyota , however , has paved the wave in going green , with its prius hybrid the leader in the industry .
the prius mixes an electric motor with a gas engine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel nozzles for hydrogen models in frankfurt even german automaker porsche - known for its luxury sports car - had a hybrid version of its cayenne suv on display in frankfurt . and , other german manufacturers did not want to be left out in the cold : volkswagen and daimlerchrysler both had " clean cars " at the fair . germany 's bmw , famous for its elegant vehicles , brought out the x6 , a new sports utility vehicle with a hybrid engine that is due to go on the market in 2009 . " we 're not just alking about cutting co2 emissions , we 're doing it , " bmw chief executive norbert reithofer told ap news agency . bmw says china copycats cars bmw , however , has had to shift gears when it comes to marketing its models . even before the motor show began , the company had locked horns with chinese automaker shuanghuan .
bmw said the chinese-made four-wheel-drive ceo was a replica of its x5 model , which it stopped producing last year . but , karl schössl , head of china automobile deutschland , the company that imports shuanghuan 's cars , said he was not concerned about pressure from bmw . bildunterschrift : citroen 's new , green " c-cactus " vehicle he told afp at the car show in frankfurt : " i am absolutely not worried " about the possiblity of cars being seized by officials . bmw said last friday that it had launched legal proceedings against the importer due to possible copyright infringements . shuanghaun 's vehicles still on show but , two different versions of the shuanghaun car went on display anyway in frankfurt , and bmw said it did not plan to have the models confiscated . " we are not planning anything tomorrow -lsb- wednesday -rsb- at 9 a.m. , " a bmw spokesman told afp news agency , though he did not rule out further action . schlössl claimed that german automakers wanted to keep chinese companies away from the european market . daimlerchrysler had also taken issue with shuanghaun , saying its noble car was a copy of daimler 's smart city car .
the noble did not go on display in frankfurt . more than 1,000 companies from around 40 countries are showing their goods at frankfurt 's international motor show , which will open to the public on saturday , sept .

the news is a blow to berlin mayor , klaus wowereit , who had petitioned the federal government recently to take over the opera . wowereit had pointed to the record three opera houses in the german capital and said the city , which faces a mountain of debt and depleted coffers , was unable to sufficiently finance all of them .
nevertheless , the federal government will add 100 million euros to the 50 million -lrb- a total of about $ 207 million -rrb- it had already promised for the renovation of the famous unter den linden opera , according to german news agency dpa .
in exchange , it expects berlin - which functions simultaneously as both a city and one of germany 's 16 federal states - to up its annual 37 million-euro contribution by an eight-digit sum .
steg added that the door had not been closed on discussions between state and federal culture representatives and that there were further possibilities for cooperation . bail-out not the first time chancellor merkel 's christian democrats welcomed the decision , though merkel had originally expressed support for a federal takeover of the opera house , said berlin daily tageszeitung .
cdu spokesperson for cultural affairs , michael braun said the committed 150 million euros would ensure the renovation of the over 250-year-old building in downtown berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star conductor and pianist daniel barenboim is the music director at the berlin state opera , unter den linden the federal government currently allots a major portion - 346 million euros - of its culture budget to the capital city .
since 2001 , the state of berlin has slashed its culture budget from 511 million euros to 351 million this year .
it 's not the first time that berlin has turned to the federal government for help with funding a landmark or putting its finances in order .
plagued by one of the highest unemployment rates in germany and no industry to speak of , berlin has long had a reputation of being " sexy but poor . "

11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .

11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .

11 on the sixth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , dw-world.de spoke with an aviation security expert about the potential for plane hijackings and the threat of aerial terrorist strikes . tim van beveren is a pilot and television journalist , and has published several books on aviation security . dw-world.de : have airplane hijackings increased or decreased since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us ? tim van beveren : one can not really speak of a tendency .
there have been some airplane hijackings since then .
more important , however , is the way hijackings have changed .
in the past , one usually assumed that passengers would be held hostage and let go if certain demands were met .
on sept .
11 , 2001 , planes were used as bombs , and exchanging passengers was not the issue at all .
that kind of scenario is a huge problem for security experts . one can then say that plane hijackings have reached a new dimension since the sept .
11 attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air safety expert tim van beveren the potential for attacks has changed completely .
if a plane is hijacked , aviation security experts must at least assume that there might be a repeat of the 9/11 attacks .
that is why a debate has begun about whether such hijacked planes should be shot down .
the most recent example was the plane just last month - in august - which two people hijacked en route from cyprus to turkey .
the two were only using mock bombs , and the hijacking did not turn bloody ; nonetheless , the two hijackers were still able to take control of the plane through violent means . are pilots now better trained to deal with these situations ? with the plane that was on its way to turkey , the pilot ended up fleeing the cockpit as soon as the plane landed .
that was certainly a clever move , since it meant no one was there anymore who was actually capable of flying the plane .
but now a legal case is being made against him for precisely that reason , and he must fear losing his pilot 's license .
following the sept .
11 attacks , pilots were certainly trained to handle the situation differently .
before , the method was to fulfill the terrorists ' demands , to remain calm and to prevent the situation from escalating .
since 9/11 , pilots are required to land the plane as soon as possible and alert the authorities , which could mean that the plane would ultimately be shot down if a landing has n't occurred already . how has technology changed in this regard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks were unparalleled nowadays , the doors to cockpits are reinforced .
cockpits are more like bank vaults now .
pilots are also forbidden to open up the door , even if passengers or crew are being threatened .
instead , they are supposed to land the plane immediately .
that is certainly a step in the right direction .
other things have changed as well - technology that can detect bombs and weapons has been improved .
but there is no guarantee that hijackers will necessarily choose a particular method for a hijacking , or that they will bring the materials they need on board themselves .
there have also been cases in which airline or airport staff in security-relevant areas have connections to terrorist networks .
for instance , it is relatively easy for cleaning personnel or mechanics to place necessary materials on board a plane .
these so-called sleeper agents who have been working for an airport or airline for a long time are the greatest danger . how should passengers behave should a hijacking occur or some other terrorist threat emerge ? that is also a double-edged sword .
on the one hand , the only way to try to escape such a dangerous situation is to do what the passengers on board the fourth plane -lsb- the plane that crashed in pennsylvania -rsb- did on sept .
11 .
they stormed the cockpit and tried to overtake the hijackers .
a great deal of courage is required for such behavior , and also , the ability to assess the situation correctly .
on the other hand , one can hardly imagine what would happen if a passenger started acting strangely , say , if he or she was suffering from claustrophobia and the other passengers on board suddenly attacked him or her due to the strange behavior .
that has actually happened before - a passenger was pushed to the ground on a plane and was choked to death in the process . is the threat of hijackings such as those on sept .
11 , 2001 still imminent ? i think the threat is always there and terrorism is a phenomenon we must address now more than ever .
there is no universal remedy for the situation , no 100-percent guarantee of safety .
just as security experts try to conceive new means of preventing hijackings , terrorists too are developing ways of getting around those methods , and concocting plans for new attacks that would grab even greater attention .
the risk is still there . elisabeth otto interviewed tim van beveren -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the terror attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , george w. bush believed he could quickly " convert " several islamic states to the political system of the west .

six years later , it 's clear that this plan has failed .

the us is still looking for an adequate answer to sept .
11 .
what about the mastermind behind the attacks - osama bin laden ?
even if the arch-enemy were to be caught , that would n't mean the end of al qaeda .
bin laden has studied economics - and has apparently learned quite a lot about building organizations .
his " terror holding " encompasses dozens of states - from bosnia and yemen to pakistan and indonesia .

it maintains an enormous supply of money and manpower .
and the fact that it has no central headquarters makes it all the more difficult to fight it .

can people be immunized against the sickness of fundamentalism ?
if so , how ?
even though the sept .
11 perpetrators and the terror suspects recently arrested in germany do n't necessarily fit the pattern , fundamentalism and radicalism tend to grow where there is poverty and a lack of prospects .
they flourish where people are uneducated .
the us troops are neither fighting poverty nor educating the people in the muslim world .
they are not even ensuring security .
and in iraq and afghanistan , as in other muslim countries , anti-american sentiment is growing .
bin laden turned the page on a new era with the 2001 attacks on the us .
political leaders throughout the world have realized that most of the muslim states are overwhelmed and ca n't even manage to provide the ever-growing masses of young men with bread and work .
many of the traditionally islamic countries do n't have competitive economies and their governments are corrupt .
as global competition increases , some feel like they have drawn the short end of the stick .
only a few arab states enjoy hefty profits from oil exports .
yet , even there , discontent with the political and social situation is increasing .
globalization seems to be making the world more complicated .
at least that 's what the media suggests .
the desire for simple answers to the muddle of world events is growing .
demagogues and those who speak in black-and-white - especially among religious leaders - are winning followers .
millions of people trust them , often wrongly .
education is desperately needed .
but it 's also tedious and time-consuming .

11 , 2001 , the us has tried - without success - to democratize the arab world with violence , writes dw 's miodrag soric .
as the bloodshed continues , it 's clear that democracy ca n't be forced . democracy ca n't be prescribed like cough syrup .
after the terror attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , george w. bush believed he could quickly " convert " several islamic states to the political system of the west .
with violence , if necessary .
six years later , it 's clear that this plan has failed .
every single day , innocent people are blown to pieces and the taliban spill blood in afghanistan .
the us is still looking for an adequate answer to sept .
11 .
what about the mastermind behind the attacks - osama bin laden ?
even if the arch-enemy were to be caught , that would n't mean the end of al qaeda .
bin laden has studied economics - and has apparently learned quite a lot about building organizations .
his " terror holding " encompasses dozens of states - from bosnia and yemen to pakistan and indonesia .
al qaeda adjusts to fit the circumstances .
it maintains an enormous supply of money and manpower .
and the fact that it has no central headquarters makes it all the more difficult to fight it .
al qaeda appeals to muslims all over the world .
can people be immunized against the sickness of fundamentalism ?
if so , how ?
even though the sept .
11 perpetrators and the terror suspects recently arrested in germany do n't necessarily fit the pattern , fundamentalism and radicalism tend to grow where there is poverty and a lack of prospects .
they flourish where people are uneducated .
the us troops are neither fighting poverty nor educating the people in the muslim world .
they are not even ensuring security .
and in iraq and afghanistan , as in other muslim countries , anti-american sentiment is growing .

11 , 2001 , the us has tried - without success - to democratize the arab world with violence , writes dw 's miodrag soric .
as the bloodshed continues , it 's clear that democracy ca n't be forced . democracy ca n't be prescribed like cough syrup .
after the terror attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , george w. bush believed he could quickly " convert " several islamic states to the political system of the west .
with violence , if necessary .
six years later , it 's clear that this plan has failed .
every single day , innocent people are blown to pieces and the taliban spill blood in afghanistan .
the us is still looking for an adequate answer to sept .
11 .
what about the mastermind behind the attacks - osama bin laden ?
even if the arch-enemy were to be caught , that would n't mean the end of al qaeda .
bin laden has studied economics - and has apparently learned quite a lot about building organizations .
his " terror holding " encompasses dozens of states - from bosnia and yemen to pakistan and indonesia .
al qaeda adjusts to fit the circumstances .
it maintains an enormous supply of money and manpower .
and the fact that it has no central headquarters makes it all the more difficult to fight it .
al qaeda appeals to muslims all over the world .
can people be immunized against the sickness of fundamentalism ?
if so , how ?
even though the sept .
11 perpetrators and the terror suspects recently arrested in germany do n't necessarily fit the pattern , fundamentalism and radicalism tend to grow where there is poverty and a lack of prospects .
they flourish where people are uneducated .
the us troops are neither fighting poverty nor educating the people in the muslim world .
they are not even ensuring security .
and in iraq and afghanistan , as in other muslim countries , anti-american sentiment is growing .
bin laden turned the page on a new era with the 2001 attacks on the us .
political leaders throughout the world have realized that most of the muslim states are overwhelmed and ca n't even manage to provide the ever-growing masses of young men with bread and work .
many of the traditionally islamic countries do n't have competitive economies and their governments are corrupt .
as global competition increases , some feel like they have drawn the short end of the stick .
only a few arab states enjoy hefty profits from oil exports .
yet , even there , discontent with the political and social situation is increasing .
globalization seems to be making the world more complicated .
at least that 's what the media suggests .
the desire for simple answers to the muddle of world events is growing .
demagogues and those who speak in black-and-white - especially among religious leaders - are winning followers .
millions of people trust them , often wrongly .
education is desperately needed .
but it 's also tedious and time-consuming .
many politicians , including bush , hoped that violence would speed up success .
the reality has shown , however , that democracy ca n't be prescribed , not even inoculated .

european papers think a miracle is needed . britain 's independent newspaper had the harshest words for the situation in iraq , saying that the latest increase in us troops " was never truly about stabilizing iraq .
the us had already lost the ability to control events on the ground when the troops began to pour in earlier this year .
its primary purpose was to stave off demands from democrats and some republicans for a timetable for a us troop withdrawal .
this is cynical and disgraceful .
but what else can we expect from a military adventure that was formed in a spirit of hubris and carried out in an atmosphere of crashing incompetence and reckless arrogance ?
the us-led occupation of iraq is unraveling in the same morally compromised manner in which it began . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger wrote that only a miracle could salvage the situation in iraq now .
" in essence , george w. bush 's vision of a democratic and secure iraq has probably failed , " it wrote .
" under the best of circumstances , the president can hope for an ' honorable peace ' like richard nixon in vietnam … the capitol hearings give the president … a window of about six months ; after that , at least five brigades will have to be withdrawn without replacement .
unless a political miracle happens in baghdad in the meantime , the regime in tehran will emerge as the victor of bush 's war because of its increased influence in iraq - and this without having spent half a trillion dollars , like washington 's warlord has .

" german business daily handelsblatt agreed that any calming of the situation represents progress .
" but compared to the original goals to turn iraq into a democratic role model for the middle east , the bar has been lowered dramatically .
washington now talks about a gentle division , about a sunnistan , shiistan and kurdistan , as if this would already signify a happy ending for iraq .
if there 's the slightest chance to prevent iraq from collapsing , it has to be pursued - no matter who will profit in terms of party politics in the us . " and the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote that it 's virtually impossible for bush to withdraw troops at this point .
" there 's no more talk about president bush 's intention to bring democracy to iraq and have it serve as an example for the arab and islamic world .
the only thing that matters now is what american soldiers can do to prevent a murderous civil war in the battered country , and whether they will continue to fight clan leaders and terrorists or withdraw and leave iraqis to deal with their own fate .
president bush can not approve a swift withdrawal , because this would not only symbolize a complete failure of his policy , but also make him responsible for a dangerous change of power relations in the middle east .

european papers think a miracle is needed . britain 's independent newspaper had the harshest words for the situation in iraq , saying that the latest increase in us troops " was never truly about stabilizing iraq .
the us had already lost the ability to control events on the ground when the troops began to pour in earlier this year .
its primary purpose was to stave off demands from democrats and some republicans for a timetable for a us troop withdrawal .
this is cynical and disgraceful .

" under the best of circumstances , the president can hope for an ' honorable peace ' like richard nixon in vietnam … the capitol hearings give the president … a window of about six months ; after that , at least five brigades will have to be withdrawn without replacement .
unless a political miracle happens in baghdad in the meantime , the regime in tehran will emerge as the victor of bush 's war because of its increased influence in iraq - and this without having spent half a trillion dollars , like washington 's warlord has .

this disastrous war that he started with lies will become his darkest chapter in history books in the future … but when independent reporters conclude after extensive research in the country that the security situation in several parts has improved , that the cooperation between americans , sunni leaders and iraqi security forces gets better and better - because the insurgents have gone too far with their anarchic terror against civilians - one should listen very carefully . " german business daily handelsblatt agreed that any calming of the situation represents progress .
" but compared to the original goals to turn iraq into a democratic role model for the middle east , the bar has been lowered dramatically .
washington now talks about a gentle division , about a sunnistan , shiistan and kurdistan , as if this would already signify a happy ending for iraq .
if there 's the slightest chance to prevent iraq from collapsing , it has to be pursued - no matter who will profit in terms of party politics in the us . " and the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote that it 's virtually impossible for bush to withdraw troops at this point .
" there 's no more talk about president bush 's intention to bring democracy to iraq and have it serve as an example for the arab and islamic world .
the only thing that matters now is what american soldiers can do to prevent a murderous civil war in the battered country , and whether they will continue to fight clan leaders and terrorists or withdraw and leave iraqis to deal with their own fate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not known exactly how many have converted to islam in germany two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .

it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .
she was the daughter of a protestant pastor with a very strong ethical sense who became radicalized when she fell in with a group of far-leftists unhappy with german society . worries about intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance of converts would be impossible to put in place , says pfaff for pfaff , the capture of the three suspects was good news , converts or not , and he calls bavarian interior minister beckstein 's suggestion for surveillance " pure populism " made to score political points .
indeed , he says , such a program would be impossible to put in place because of the uncertainty around the number of converts in germany and the lack of a central register for them . but , pfaff says , ideas such as surveillance worry some german converts to islam who , unlike their turkish or other co-religionists from the middle east , have nowhere to go if the atmosphere for muslims in germany became intolerant and rights began to disappear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.09.2007 alleged duisburg link stirs debate on 9/11 anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cell behind the 9/11 attacks could have had links to duisburg six years have passed since the 9/11 attacks but new information about the hijackers and the origins of their plan continues to come to light .
information investigated by german police at the time has resurfaced . it 's well-known that core elements of the plot were hatched among a radicalized muslim student group in hamburg , but newspapers in germany are reviving a report from an unlikely source linking another mosque in another german city .
monday , sept .
10 , 2001 , was a morning like most others in a kindergarten in the western german city of duisburg .
that is until a little boy named mustafa arrived .
he 'd been to his weekly koran study class at the mosque the day before and had heard something weird there , says a spokesperson for the kindergarten .
" even before he took his jacket off , he came to me and blurted out that he 'd come from arabic school , and that he 'd heard some grown-ups talking there .
they 'd said that a plane was going to hit a big building and that a lot of people would die . "
at the time , all she could think was that maybe mustafa had seen too much tv , or an especially explosive action movie .
but a day later , the little boy 's words haunted the kindergarten worker .
" after 9/11 , what he 'd said came back to me .
i am positive that what he told me , he told me on the 10th of september , one day before it all happened in the us . "
evidence suggests prior knowledge in duisburg bildunterschrift : needless to say , she went to the police .
and if the story at first sounds like a bit of conspiracy-mongering , recent reports in the german media include evidence which suggests the pieces of the jigsaw fit together to form a believable picture .
mustafa 's father was a regular visitor to a mosque known to hold radical meetings .
and police found a card from the mosque when they searched mohammed atta 's hamburg apartment after the attacks on sept .
11 .
also , in a number of households of people who attended the mosque , police found the date sept .
11 , 2001 , inscribed with an arabic notice which read : " the program ends . "

information investigated by german police at the time has resurfaced . it 's well-known that core elements of the plot were hatched among a radicalized muslim student group in hamburg , but newspapers in germany are reviving a report from an unlikely source linking another mosque in another german city .
monday , sept .
10 , 2001 , was a morning like most others in a kindergarten in the western german city of duisburg .
that is until a little boy named mustafa arrived .
he 'd been to his weekly koran study class at the mosque the day before and had heard something weird there , says a spokesperson for the kindergarten .
" even before he took his jacket off , he came to me and blurted out that he 'd come from arabic school , and that he 'd heard some grown-ups talking there .
they 'd said that a plane was going to hit a big building and that a lot of people would die . "
at the time , all she could think was that maybe mustafa had seen too much tv , or an especially explosive action movie .
but a day later , the little boy 's words haunted the kindergarten worker .
" after 9/11 , what he 'd said came back to me .
i am positive that what he told me , he told me on the 10th of september , one day before it all happened in the us . "
evidence suggests prior knowledge in duisburg bildunterschrift : needless to say , she went to the police .
and if the story at first sounds like a bit of conspiracy-mongering , recent reports in the german media include evidence which suggests the pieces of the jigsaw fit together to form a believable picture .
mustafa 's father was a regular visitor to a mosque known to hold radical meetings .
and police found a card from the mosque when they searched mohammed atta 's hamburg apartment after the attacks on sept .
11 .
also , in a number of households of people who attended the mosque , police found the date sept .
11 , 2001 , inscribed with an arabic notice which read : " the program ends . "
in the same calendars , six months before , on the date april 15 , was inscribed in arabic : the program begins . "
that date was later to be discovered as the day when many of the hijackers slipped into the us to begin final preparations for the attacks .
the man who gave these calendars out to friends at the mosque maintains , however , that the inscriptions are coincidental .
they refer to a savings plan , he says .
guantanamo inmate was a frequent visitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ould slahi has been held at guantanamo bay since 2001 another connection to the attacks lies in the person of mohamed ould slahi .
the mauritanian national , who has been in american custody at guantanamo since 2001 , studied electrical engineering in duisburg and was a frequent visitor to the mosque .
slahi is said to have helped atta recruit men to carry out the attacks .
it is now believed he might have been one of the men young mustafa heard talking on sept .
10 .
who those other men might have been and whether they are still living in germany remains unknown .
however , authorities in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is situated , have dismissed the link between the city and the 9/11 attacks , saying police had thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the year after the attack and did not consider it important .
" we do n't think the history of sept .
11 has to be completely rewritten because of this , " state interior ministry spokesman ludger harmeier told german press agency dpa . matt hermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized . perhaps just as shocking to many germans upon hearing that the terrorist attacks planned could have been more deadly than those carried out in london or madrid was the fact that two of three suspects taken into custody , fritz g. and daniel s. , were germans who had converted to islam . it led bavaria 's interior minister and premier designate , günther beckstein , to argue that in certain cases , german authorities should keep an eye on people who convert to islam .
while there is no central register for converts , the conservative minister told the financial daily handelsblatt last week that when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one . " the controversial suggestion has unleashed a discussion over the nature of conversion , religious zeal and the appeal that converts have to islamic radicals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three suspected islamic terrorists were from a group with a " profound hatred of us citizens " one of the three men now in custody was observed studying a us military base at hanau late last year , which moved police to begin their surveillance operations .
although the three knew they were being watched , they continued their planning . " this underlines their devotion , or fanaticism , in regard to their goal , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal crime agency . germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he was concerned about the radicalization of converts , but did not want to place muslims under general suspicion .
margot kässmann , bishop of germany 's largest protestant church , warned against overreaction and that even new christian converts were often filled with zeal for their faith . role of conversion under scrutiny still , the fact that two of the suspects were germans who knew the country 's laws and customs , could blend in perfectly , and yet were willing to kill large numbers of people , has many asking if their conversion to islam was a motivating factor in their becoming terrorists . according to kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study , converts to islam do pose a danger that is higher than those who are born into the religion .
the theory is that the religious convictions of those who choose to convert are much stronger than those simply following in the religious footsteps of their families .
they can have the tendency to give 110 percent to the new faith . " converts can be more easily radicalized , " hirschmann told the news web site tagesschau.de " as ' novices , ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders .
that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . " conversion not in a vacuum but others warn against painting with too broad a brush , saying the reasons and circumstances around conversions are too varied and that it 's not the conversion itself that leads to radicalization , but the kind of group one associates with once within the new faith . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a teacher , brigitte weiss , wears a headscarf in court - she converted to islam a year ago .
" conversions seldom happen in isolation , " said stefan reichmuth , a professor of islamic studies at the ruhr university in bochum .
" they occur in the context of acquaintances , the environment or the networks that one encounters after converting . " most conversions to islam in germany , according to him , occur among women who marry muslim men .
among this group , radicalization is rare and the wives will generally take on the form of islam practiced within the family . " so you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an implicit tendency towards becoming a radical , " he said .
" there might be more solidarity among the group , particularly after sept .
11 , but that does n't mean one has to become an islamist . " estimates about the number of converts to islam in germany vary widely .
according to the federal interior ministry , between 15,000 and 40,000 german converts and their children are living in the country .
other groups say the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 . the ministry estimates that in 2005 , around 1,000 germans became muslims , although the german islam archive puts the number of converts between july 2004 and june 2005 at 4,000 . tiny minority of radicalized converts for michael muhammad abduh pfaff , the chairman of the german muslim league and a convert himself , the latest debate only tends to fuel fears about islam in the larger population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is really sure how many german coverts to islam there are the 42-year old , who converted to islam 18 years ago after having studied the religion in college , says there are many reasons people convert , including a sense of anger at society or injustice in the world .
he agrees with experts who say those young people can be especially susceptible to a radical message and islamist messengers .
for these angry , mostly male youth , the ideology of revolt because of a hatred of the status quo can overshadow any theology .
but he worries that overblown coverage will give people a false impression . " of all the muslim converts in germany , we 're talking about 25 or so who would fit into this category , " he said . he draws comparisons to gudrun ensslin of the red army faction , the left-wing terrorist group at the center of germany 's " autumn of terror " 30 years ago .

the news is a blow to berlin mayor , klaus wowereit , who had petitioned the federal government recently to take over the opera . wowereit had pointed to the record three opera houses in the german capital and said the city , which faces a mountain of debt and depleted coffers , was unable to sufficiently finance all of them .
nevertheless , the federal government will add 100 million euros to the 50 million -lrb- a total of about $ 207 million -rrb- it had already promised for the renovation of the famous unter den linden opera , according to german news agency dpa .
in exchange , it expects berlin - which functions simultaneously as both a city and one of germany 's 16 federal states - to up its annual 37 million-euro contribution by an eight-digit sum .
steg added that the door had not been closed on discussions between state and federal culture representatives and that there were further possibilities for cooperation . bail-out not the first time chancellor merkel 's christian democrats welcomed the decision , though merkel had originally expressed support for a federal takeover of the opera house , said berlin daily tageszeitung .
cdu spokesperson for cultural affairs , michael braun said the committed 150 million euros would ensure the renovation of the over 250-year-old building in downtown berlin .

since 2001 , the state of berlin has slashed its culture budget from 511 million euros to 351 million this year .
it 's not the first time that berlin has turned to the federal government for help with funding a landmark or putting its finances in order .

the stars have signed up for oxjam , which aims to raise £ 1 million to help tackle poverty around the world .
music memorabilia will be sold during the day at the shop - its precise location has not yet been confirmed - and it will host the gigs at night .
the chemical brothers and jarvis cocker have designed badges for the campaign .
the kooks will perform an acoustic set on monday , 1 october , with cocker also on the bill as a dj that evening .
jamelia and killa kela have been confirmed for the following day , while hot chip and dj bobby friction will appear on wednesday of that week .
fatboy slim - real name norman cook - and emmanuel jal round off the live sets on thursday , 4 october .
cook said he had always donated his unwanted records to oxfam but performing in one of its charity shops " will be a first " , and promised " a few choice tunes " .
for the kooks , singer luke pritchard praised the campaign , saying it was all about " thousands of small events adding up to something much bigger " to make a difference .
oxfam said its target of £ 1 million would fund the provision of drinking water for almost 1.4 million people , or 20,000 emergency shelters , or medicine to treat 10,000 people .

he was arrested in his home province of valle del cauca .
mr montoya - known in colombia 's underworld as the " boss of bosses " - appears on the us federal bureau of investigation 's " 10 most wanted " list .
he is accused of producing tons of cocaine for the us market .
officials say he helped found the norte del valle cartel based near the city of cali .
the bbc 's jeremy mcdermott in bogota says mr montoya 's capture is a huge coup for the government and ends the reign of one of the legends of the colombian underworld .
no warning mr montoya , 49 , was arrested with just two bodyguards and in the company of his mother , without the rings of security that have foiled attempted raids in the past .

colombia 's defence minister , juan manuel santos , said mr montoya controlled a vast trafficking network responsible for about 70 % of the cocaine smuggled to the us and europe .
mr montoya 's private army of assassins , called los machos , was behind some 1,500 killings , mr santos said .
" drug traffickers take note : this is the future that awaits you , " the minister told a news conference .

arms trade critics , shouting " murderers " at exhibitors , were quickly overwhelmed by police after breaking through the initial security cordon .
the metropolitan police say between 15 and 20 people were arrested for a suspected breach of the peace .
further disruption is expected later when pressure group campaign against arms trade holds a demonstration .
held every two years , the defence systems & equipment international show attracts more than 1,350 exhibitors and military delegations from 56 countries .
the dsei event is a showcase for weapons systems , ranging from logistics software to tanks and rocket launchers .
soldiers and exhibitors come not just from the uk , germany , the us and other nato countries , but from countries such as libya , russia , saudi arabia , iraq , pakistan and india .
however , as in previous years , the organisers have ordered exhibitors not to show any equipment that might be considered too offensive - such as torture devices and cluster bombs - neither as an exhibit , nor in pictures or literature .
as well as the campaign against arms trade protest , other campaigners have threatened to try to disrupt the event using " direct action " .
for sale public pressure has persuaded the company organising the show , reed elsevier , to sell the business by the end of the year .
dsei spokesman al lockwood said the sale was on track and that bids for the show were currently being assessed .
he added dsei had a " bright future " and would be held again in september 2009 at the same venue .
" we are well aware that dsei has its critics , " mr lockwood said , adding that organisers had designated an area where demonstrators could protest and would be visible to visitors arriving at the exhibition .
there had been doubts about the future of the exhibition , after prime minister gordon brown decided to abolish the government 's defence export services organisation -lrb- deso -rrb- , which helps to organise the show and hosts all foreign military organisations .

arms trade critics , shouting " murderers " at exhibitors , were quickly overwhelmed by police after breaking through the initial security cordon .
the metropolitan police say between 15 and 20 people were arrested for a suspected breach of the peace .
further disruption is expected later when pressure group campaign against arms trade holds a demonstration .
held every two years , the defence systems & equipment international show attracts more than 1,350 exhibitors and military delegations from 56 countries .
the dsei event is a showcase for weapons systems , ranging from logistics software to tanks and rocket launchers .
soldiers and exhibitors come not just from the uk , germany , the us and other nato countries , but from countries such as libya , russia , saudi arabia , iraq , pakistan and india .
however , as in previous years , the organisers have ordered exhibitors not to show any equipment that might be considered too offensive - such as torture devices and cluster bombs - neither as an exhibit , nor in pictures or literature .

for sale public pressure has persuaded the company organising the show , reed elsevier , to sell the business by the end of the year .
security around the london venue is tight dsei spokesman al lockwood said the sale was on track and that bids for the show were currently being assessed .
he added dsei had a " bright future " and would be held again in september 2009 at the same venue .
" we are well aware that dsei has its critics , " mr lockwood said , adding that organisers had designated an area where demonstrators could protest and would be visible to visitors arriving at the exhibition .
there had been doubts about the future of the exhibition , after prime minister gordon brown decided to abolish the government 's defence export services organisation -lrb- deso -rrb- , which helps to organise the show and hosts all foreign military organisations .

eritrea is accused of supplying weapons to somali militant groups fiercely self-reliant , the continent 's youngest nation was hailed at its independence in 1993 for its determination to rebuild after its devastating 30-year liberation war from arch-foe ethiopia .
it developed close links with the west .
asmara swiftly offered support in 2001 to the united states to tackle international terrorism , while eritrean president isaias afewerki was called a " renaissance leader " by then us president bill clinton .
not today .
relations have soured between eritrea and western nations - especially the us - further than ever before , analysts say .
' lies ' us assistant secretary of state jendayi frazer on saturday repeated warnings washington could add eritrea to its list of rogue states , alongside countries such as iran , north korea and cuba .
the us argues eritrea is destabilising the horn of africa by backing rebels as proxies to fight ethiopia , with whom it remains in a tense border stand-off .
if the us wants to undermine our national interests and disrupt regional peace , they can hardly expect us to encourage them eritrean president isaias afewerki asmara rejects such accusations , dismissing as " lies " claims by washington - as well as by united nations experts - of shipping weapons and cash for islamist militants fighting ethiopian troops in somalia .
but washington angrily seized on the appearance this week at a somali opposition conference in asmara of sheikh hassan dahir aweys , an exiled somali islamist leader accused of links to al-qaeda .
it is evidence , washington says , that eritrea gives sanctuary to terrorists .
ms frazer has said that the gathering of further intelligence could lead to eritrea being named as a " state sponsor of terrorism " - followed by tough financial sanctions .
' humanitarian grounds ' but eritrea categorically denies any wrongdoing , arguing it is working only to encourage peace in somalia - as it did with eastern sudanese rebels .
eritrean officials were therefore furious at the media attention focused on mr aweys ' appearance at the asmara conference .
some asmara residents fear a us invasion the renegade somali leaders insist eritrean support is based " on purely humanitarian grounds " .
much of eritrea 's anger with the us stems from what it sees as washington 's failure to pressurise ethiopia to implement a five-year old border ruling following their 1998-2000 conflict , in which some 70,000 died in world war i-style trench warfare .
eritrea views washington 's support of ethiopia as a strategic ally in the region as a threat , believing that a us-ethiopian coalition is using terrorism accusations as a pretext for invasion .
asmara argues that aggressive us foreign policy is fuelling conflict in the volatile region , pointing to washington 's support for ethiopia 's military intervention to topple islamist forces in somalia late last year .
that drove relations between the super-power and the small but defiant red sea state from awkward to downright icy .
last chance each side has since engaged in tit-for-tat diplomatic restrictions .
the us embassy withdrew consulate services after it accused asmara of demanding to inspect confidential diplomatic pouches .
sheikh aweys is on a us list of terror suspects washington then imposed travel restrictions on eritrean diplomats following comparable restrictions on us staff , and has also ordered the closure of eritrea 's californian consulate .
eritrea 's domestic policies have also drawn us criticism , with washington regularly accusing the government of gross human rights violations , including the arrest of critics , religious persecution and the closure of all independent media .
these are all charges denied by asmara , which believes washington wants to use democracy and the promotion of minority religious groups as a scheme to splinter ethnically diverse eritrea into rival factions .
relations have - at least not yet - reached crisis point .
" there 's always a chance for eritrea to stop what it 's doing , " ms frazer warned .
however , mr isaias was in no mood for compromise in a recent vitriolic interview broadcast on state-television criticising us policy .
" if the us wants to undermine our national interests and disrupt regional peace , they can hardly expect us to encourage them , " he raged .
with asmara protesting it has done nothing wrong , it is unlikely to concede to demands by washington anytime soon .
if relations worsen further , many fear the potential consequences for the already troubled horn of africa .

eritrea is accused of supplying weapons to somali militant groups fiercely self-reliant , the continent 's youngest nation was hailed at its independence in 1993 for its determination to rebuild after its devastating 30-year liberation war from arch-foe ethiopia .
it developed close links with the west .
asmara swiftly offered support in 2001 to the united states to tackle international terrorism , while eritrean president isaias afewerki was called a " renaissance leader " by then us president bill clinton .
not today .
relations have soured between eritrea and western nations - especially the us - further than ever before , analysts say .
' lies ' us assistant secretary of state jendayi frazer on saturday repeated warnings washington could add eritrea to its list of rogue states , alongside countries such as iran , north korea and cuba .
the us argues eritrea is destabilising the horn of africa by backing rebels as proxies to fight ethiopia , with whom it remains in a tense border stand-off .
if the us wants to undermine our national interests and disrupt regional peace , they can hardly expect us to encourage them eritrean president isaias afewerki asmara rejects such accusations , dismissing as " lies " claims by washington - as well as by united nations experts - of shipping weapons and cash for islamist militants fighting ethiopian troops in somalia .
but washington angrily seized on the appearance this week at a somali opposition conference in asmara of sheikh hassan dahir aweys , an exiled somali islamist leader accused of links to al-qaeda .
it is evidence , washington says , that eritrea gives sanctuary to terrorists .
ms frazer has said that the gathering of further intelligence could lead to eritrea being named as a " state sponsor of terrorism " - followed by tough financial sanctions .
' humanitarian grounds ' but eritrea categorically denies any wrongdoing , arguing it is working only to encourage peace in somalia - as it did with eastern sudanese rebels .
eritrean officials were therefore furious at the media attention focused on mr aweys ' appearance at the asmara conference .
some asmara residents fear a us invasion the renegade somali leaders insist eritrean support is based " on purely humanitarian grounds " .
much of eritrea 's anger with the us stems from what it sees as washington 's failure to pressurise ethiopia to implement a five-year old border ruling following their 1998-2000 conflict , in which some 70,000 died in world war i-style trench warfare .
eritrea views washington 's support of ethiopia as a strategic ally in the region as a threat , believing that a us-ethiopian coalition is using terrorism accusations as a pretext for invasion .
asmara argues that aggressive us foreign policy is fuelling conflict in the volatile region , pointing to washington 's support for ethiopia 's military intervention to topple islamist forces in somalia late last year .
that drove relations between the super-power and the small but defiant red sea state from awkward to downright icy .
last chance each side has since engaged in tit-for-tat diplomatic restrictions .
the us embassy withdrew consulate services after it accused asmara of demanding to inspect confidential diplomatic pouches .
sheikh aweys is on a us list of terror suspects washington then imposed travel restrictions on eritrean diplomats following comparable restrictions on us staff , and has also ordered the closure of eritrea 's californian consulate .
eritrea 's domestic policies have also drawn us criticism , with washington regularly accusing the government of gross human rights violations , including the arrest of critics , religious persecution and the closure of all independent media .
these are all charges denied by asmara , which believes washington wants to use democracy and the promotion of minority religious groups as a scheme to splinter ethnically diverse eritrea into rival factions .
relations have - at least not yet - reached crisis point .
" there 's always a chance for eritrea to stop what it 's doing , " ms frazer warned .
however , mr isaias was in no mood for compromise in a recent vitriolic interview broadcast on state-television criticising us policy .
" if the us wants to undermine our national interests and disrupt regional peace , they can hardly expect us to encourage them , " he raged .
with asmara protesting it has done nothing wrong , it is unlikely to concede to demands by washington anytime soon .
if relations worsen further , many fear the potential consequences for the already troubled horn of africa .

it is hoping to dramatically improve communications in the developing world .
swedish company terranet has developed the idea using peer-to-peer technology that enables users to speak on its handsets without the need for a mobile phone base station .
the technology is designed for remote areas of the countryside or desert where base stations are unfeasible .
projects backed by terranet recently launched in tanzania and ecuador .
terranet founder anders carlius told the bbc world service 's digital planet programme that the idea for terranet came when he was on safari in tanzania in 2002 , and found that poor connectivity meant he could not ring friends riding in another jeep only a few metres away .
" i started thinking , ' could n't we get phone-to-phone without needing any other equipment , and actually have real voice communication , like a telephone call , between units ? " ' he said .
digital identity the terranet technology works using handsets adapted to work as peers that can route data or calls for other phones in the network .
the handsets also serve as nodes between other handsets , extending the reach of the entire system .
each handset has an effective range of about one kilometre .
this collaborative routing of calls means there is no cost to talk between handsets .
when a terranet phone is switched on , it begins to look for other phones within range .
if it finds them , it starts to connect and extend the radio network .
when a number is dialled a handset checks to see if the person being called is within range .
if they are , the call goes through .
while individually the phones only have a maximum range of 1km , any phone in between two others can forward calls , allowing the distance to double .
this principle applied many times creates a mini network .
however , mr carlius admitted that this has created big problems with having enough available frequencies .
the system can also be used to make calls to other terranet mesh networks via a net-connected pc fitted with an inexpensive usb dongle .
" if you look at places like africa , south america , india , china , we 're really for the first time giving people a digital identity , " he added .
" people are able to talk to other people using a phone number .
" with our stuff , we are giving the low-end man or woman the chance to talk locally for free . "
and terranet phones currently only work with a special handset - although mr carlius said he hopes that it will eventually be a feature available on all phones , like bluetooth .
he said that were this to happen , it could potentially spell the end for the current global system for mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- communications model .
about 70 % of all mobile phones use this technology .
mr carlius said large mobile firms did not like the idea of using a peer-to-peer model to make calls .
" one of the biggest things against us is that the big operators and technology providers are really pushing against us , saying this technology does n't work and it does n't have a business model , " he said .
" this is fine - just join us in lund and see how the technology works , and ask our customers how our business model works . "
mr carlius said that mobile phone manufacturer ericsson had invested around £ 3m in terranet , and this indicated that the business model for the network is sound .
