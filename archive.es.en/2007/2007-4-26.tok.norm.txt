bremen are the only non-spanish team left with osasuna meeting sevilla in the other semi . never before has spain managed to have three teams in the uefa semis , and the public interest in the competition is higher than ever , particularly since the proud football nation has no team left in the champions league .
understandably , there is even more media attention being paid to the osasuna-sevilla semi than to the espanyol-bremen tie .
but that 's just fine for werder 's opponents who are focused purely on getting a result at home and preventing the free-scoring germans from getting a vital away goal .
defender daniel jarque said on monday that " we have to stop them from scoring here . "
jarque added that " we really have to enjoy games like this , this is what we are footballers for . "
free-scoring werder a challenge for any team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espanyol midfielder moises hurtado , for his part , said on tuesday that " werder bremen are the big favourite to win the uefa cup ... they have an enormous offensive capacity and they are coming from the champions league . "
bremen were only narrowly eliminated in a tough champions league group with chelsea and barcelona .
boasting world cup top scorer miroslav klose and brazilian playmaker diego , bremen have overcome an early-spring slump and are in fine form again , on the heels of bundesliga leaders schalke and ready to deliver in the uefa cup as well .
" we are highly motivated .
every player dreams of these big matches .
we will do out utmost to claim both titles , in the league and in the uefa cup , " said diego .
klose said bremen has " no reason to hide " as the germans aim to take a first step towards preventing a final between two teams from one league which last came in 1998 when inter milan beat fellow- italians lazio .
title holders storming to second consecutive final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevilla hope to repeat these scenes next month holders sevilla are also hot favourites to reach the final again , though they rarely fare well in osasuna 's intimidating reino de navarra stadium .
sevilla coach juande ramos should have his entire squad available , given that andres palop , renato , adriano and frederic kanoute are all now fit and raring to go .
jose maria del nido , the ambitious president of sevilla , pointed out on monday , that his priority is to qualify for the champions league rather than retain the uefa cup or win the spanish king 's cup .
" the champions league is a strategic , sporting and economic objective which will permit us to increase our budget by about 30 per cent , " he claimed .
" the uefa cup and the king 's cup are important but our priority has to be getting in the champions league . "
sevilla are currently second in " la liga " , after thrashing athletic bilbao 4-1 on sunday .
osasuna 's only doubt concerns iranian international javad nekounam , who has been out since march 30 with a twisted knee .
midfielders francisco punal and ludovic delporte are both fit again after lengthy layoffs .
osasuna coach jose angel ziganda rested several key players in sunday 's 1-0 away to deportivo coruna , most notably enrique corrales , roberto soldado and savo milosevic .
osasuna defender carlos cuellar said on tuesday that sevilla are " a good team " but added that " we are certainly not afraid of them . "
cuellar added that " the important thing on thursday will be to not concede a goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.04.2007 german beekeepers fighting for the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bee populations have been devastated - the reason why is unclear bee populations in the us have dramatically dropped over the last six months .
german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .
here we almost look after every single colony . "
age factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honey as well as wax and royal jelly are products that come from beekeeping on the other hand , german apiary faces its own difficulties .
" beekeepers here tend to be loners , " said schricker , who has been studying bees since becoming a student of zoology in the 1960s .
" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .
politicians have n't realized the value of honey bees . "
age is also a major issue .
friedrich said federation members are , on average , 60 years old , while most of the people taking up the hobby also tend to be 40 and over .
the mobility required in today 's society makes it difficult to persuade young people to take up the hobby , she said .
" the age structure remains a problem , " friedrich said .
" the tendency is positive .
more women are joining .
up to now it has always tended to be a bit of a male domain .
but more beekeepers are dying than are taking up the hobby .
if we are to keep it alive , we need lots of new people . "
across the country , a whole variety of courses are on offer to introduce people all ages to beekeeping .
in bavaria , a leasing scheme has been launched to allow potential beekeepers to try out the pastime .
city bees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recruitment drive is on to find young beekeepers and although beekeeping has traditionally been very much a rural pastime that does not mean that city dwellers have to be excluded .
" even in berlin people keep bees , " schricker said .
" in allotments , on rooftop gardens and even on their balconies . "
a berlin bee has even been bred especially to suit urban conditions .
" it has certain characteristics such as docility and it is also attracted to blossom that you can find in the city - tree blossom mainly , " he said .
while people may not have to live in the country to become a beekeeper , a dollop of idealism helps .
the profits that can be made from selling hand-harvested honey tend to be limited .
" it 's a nice hobby , " schricker said .
" you also have to appreciate the social value too .
keeping bees is a very good way to react to climate change .
here on the ground it 's a way each one of us can do something for the future .

but in last weekend 's loss to stuttgart , munich ran out of luck - to many fans ' delight . with nineteen bundesliga titles to their name , bayern munich are used to lording it over the rest of the league .
munich haters often refer to their new stadium , the allianzarena as the " arrogance arena , " and bayern president franz beckenbauer once dismissed the uefa cup as a competition for losers . but the uefa cup - and not , as is customary , the champions league - is precisely where bayern would be if the season ended today .
five points behind third-place stuttgart , once-mighty munich will struggle to salvage anything from this season . and the prospect of seeing the bundesliga 's titan drop into the ranks of the also-rans for the first time in more than a decade has many fans rubbing their hands with glee . the tabloid bild newspaper described the team as " idiots " and " losers in lederhosen " after their desultory performance in stuttgart .
and the bz newspaper wrote : " they used to brag that they were stronger than ox .
but now they 're the ones getting gored . " throwing money at the problem could be a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger is one of many who have disappointed bayern 's bosses have already said they will revamp the squad in the off-season , and bloggers on throughout germany are relishing the prospect of seeing the bundesliga 's richest club have to break open the piggy bank . bayern 's biggest need , everyone agrees , is a creative midfielder .
neither mark van bommel , who 's more of a workhorse , nor bastian schweinsteiger , who 's more comfortable on the wing , have been able the play the role previously filled by stefan effenberg , mehmet scholl and michael ballack . but if bayern are only competing in the uefa cup next season , it 's unlikely that they can attract a top international playmaker - no matter how much they loosen the purse-strings . and the typical bayern strategy of luring away players from other bundesliga sides may not work either .
the best playmaker in the league , bremen 's diego , has already said he 's not interested in offers from munich .
schalke 's lincoln and hamburg 's raphael van der vaart have made similar statements . rebuilding or regression ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ottmar hitzfeld has n't been able top turn things around bayern will start to try and salvage the season this weekend at home to hamburg , but it 's an uphill battle .
coach ottmar hitzfeld says he hopes he will have seven or eight new players with whom he can stage a comeback next year . but even some bayern fans are questioning whether hitzfeld , who led the club in its glory years around the millennium , is up to the job . " for me he 's the wrong coach to clean up the club , " wrote one blogger .
" on the contrary , he fits perfectly with the current system . " bayern brought back hitzfeld this february to replace felix magath , but his record has been worse than his predecessor 's . and some fans blame management for poor personnel decisions .
" i do n't think the magical troika -lrb- of uli hoeneß , karl-heinz rummenigge and franz beckenbauer -rrb- know how the club should develop , " another disappointed supporter wrote .
" it never occurs to them that they might be to blame for things not going well . " when commercial manager uli hoeneß cautioned bayern fans at beginning of the 2006-7 campaign that this would be a transitional season , most supporters thought he was being over-cautious .
now they know better . " a ' transitional season , " ' one fan sighed in an internet post .

dw 's karl zawadzky comments on what the leadership crisis means for germany 's biggest electronics company . those who thought that supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer would be the last to go in connection with the siemens corruption scandal have been proven wrong : chief executive klaus kleinfeld will give up his post , too .
and he 's unlikely to be the last sacrifice in the executive suite .
siemens managerial board members are facing federal prosecutors ; one active member spent time in police custody as did a former board member .
in an open power struggle , the supervisory board refused to extend kleinfeld 's contract .
kleinfeld had no choice but to announce his voluntary resignation .
thus , he avoided getting fired .
the fate of top professionals at this globally active company is not the issue .
the issue is siemens itself .
the way the crisis has been managed is just as scandalous as the actual events that caused it .
up to 400 million euros -lrb- $ 540 million -rrb- - a gigantic sum - were embezzled for bribes to win massive contracts in countries prone to corruption .
investigators are feverishly searching for proof of corruption , for the perpetrators and for those responsible .
so far , no one believes that long-time ceo von pierer or his successor , kleinfeld , was personally involved in the scandal or even that they were aware of the bribes .
but they are nevertheless not free of responsibility .
how could millions and millions disappear into shady channels without the boss knowing anything about it ?
if that was the case , then there was a lack of control and control mechanisms .
perhaps the company 's executives did n't look too closely , because then an otherwise prevalent practice that led so nicely to large contracts would n't have worked anymore ?
that 's just a suspicion .
but it 's enough .
on top of it all comes a scandal within a scandal : siemens violated german law by putting millions of euros into the foundation of an employer-friendly organization to represent workers which was meant to undermine the trade union .
divide and conquer was the strategy .
it 's true that without a thorough clean-up at the top , siemens wo n't be able to make a credible new start .
however , the employers ' representatives in the supervisory board behaved extremely unprofessionally , causing the company further damage .
with nearly 500,000 employees , plants , joint ventures and offices in practically every country in the world , siemens is one of the biggest global companies - and now it has no leadership .
the concern is desperately searching for a new ceo .
that provides an ideal opportunity for carpetbaggers who long ago first suggested breaking up the company and selling off its individual parts .

but in last weekend 's loss to stuttgart , munich ran out of luck - to many fans ' delight . with nineteen bundesliga titles to their name , bayern munich are used to lording it over the rest of the league .
munich haters often refer to their new stadium , the allianzarena as the " arrogance arena , " and bayern president franz beckenbauer once dismissed the uefa cup as a competition for losers . but the uefa cup - and not , as is customary , the champions league - is precisely where bayern would be if the season ended today .
five points behind third-place stuttgart , once-mighty munich will struggle to salvage anything from this season . and the prospect of seeing the bundesliga 's titan drop into the ranks of the also-rans for the first time in more than a decade has many fans rubbing their hands with glee . the tabloid bild newspaper described the team as " idiots " and " losers in lederhosen " after their desultory performance in stuttgart .
and the bz newspaper wrote : " they used to brag that they were stronger than ox .
but now they 're the ones getting gored . " throwing money at the problem could be a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger is one of many who have disappointed bayern 's bosses have already said they will revamp the squad in the off-season , and bloggers on throughout germany are relishing the prospect of seeing the bundesliga 's richest club have to break open the piggy bank . bayern 's biggest need , everyone agrees , is a creative midfielder .
neither mark van bommel , who 's more of a workhorse , nor bastian schweinsteiger , who 's more comfortable on the wing , have been able the play the role previously filled by stefan effenberg , mehmet scholl and michael ballack . but if bayern are only competing in the uefa cup next season , it 's unlikely that they can attract a top international playmaker - no matter how much they loosen the purse-strings . and the typical bayern strategy of luring away players from other bundesliga sides may not work either .
the best playmaker in the league , bremen 's diego , has already said he 's not interested in offers from munich .
schalke 's lincoln and hamburg 's raphael van der vaart have made similar statements . rebuilding or regression ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ottmar hitzfeld has n't been able top turn things around bayern will start to try and salvage the season this weekend at home to hamburg , but it 's an uphill battle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders society -pipe- 26.04.2007 school violence : " we need to recognize the risk signals " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why ? " read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?

" read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .

but in last weekend 's loss to stuttgart , munich ran out of luck - to many fans ' delight . with nineteen bundesliga titles to their name , bayern munich are used to lording it over the rest of the league .
munich haters often refer to their new stadium , the allianzarena as the " arrogance arena , " and bayern president franz beckenbauer once dismissed the uefa cup as a competition for losers . but the uefa cup - and not , as is customary , the champions league - is precisely where bayern would be if the season ended today .
five points behind third-place stuttgart , once-mighty munich will struggle to salvage anything from this season . and the prospect of seeing the bundesliga 's titan drop into the ranks of the also-rans for the first time in more than a decade has many fans rubbing their hands with glee . the tabloid bild newspaper described the team as " idiots " and " losers in lederhosen " after their desultory performance in stuttgart .

but in last weekend 's loss to stuttgart , munich ran out of luck - to many fans ' delight . with nineteen bundesliga titles to their name , bayern munich are used to lording it over the rest of the league .
munich haters often refer to their new stadium , the allianzarena as the " arrogance arena , " and bayern president franz beckenbauer once dismissed the uefa cup as a competition for losers . but the uefa cup - and not , as is customary , the champions league - is precisely where bayern would be if the season ended today .
five points behind third-place stuttgart , once-mighty munich will struggle to salvage anything from this season . and the prospect of seeing the bundesliga 's titan drop into the ranks of the also-rans for the first time in more than a decade has many fans rubbing their hands with glee . the tabloid bild newspaper described the team as " idiots " and " losers in lederhosen " after their desultory performance in stuttgart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders society -pipe- 26.04.2007 school violence : " we need to recognize the risk signals " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why ? " read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .
what we found in many of the incidents is that the shooters were , actually , treated unjustly .
in erfurt , -lrb- the shooter robert -rrb- steinhäuser had to leave school in the 12th grade .
and he was kicked out for quite a minor infraction .
at this point , he had nothing to do ; he was totally lost .
in emsdetten , the shooter was treated unfairly by his peers .
making procedures to deal with these could be a big step toward toward prevention . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virginia shooting causes shockwaves in germany 's erfurt the shock of the virginia shooting massacre is being echoed in the eastern german city of erfurt , where there were calls for tighter gun control laws after a student shot dead 16 people at his high school five years ago .

dw 's karl zawadzky comments on what the leadership crisis means for germany 's biggest electronics company . those who thought that supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer would be the last to go in connection with the siemens corruption scandal have been proven wrong : chief executive klaus kleinfeld will give up his post , too .
and he 's unlikely to be the last sacrifice in the executive suite .
siemens managerial board members are facing federal prosecutors ; one active member spent time in police custody as did a former board member .
in an open power struggle , the supervisory board refused to extend kleinfeld 's contract .
kleinfeld had no choice but to announce his voluntary resignation .
thus , he avoided getting fired .
the fate of top professionals at this globally active company is not the issue .
the issue is siemens itself .
the way the crisis has been managed is just as scandalous as the actual events that caused it .
up to 400 million euros -lrb- $ 540 million -rrb- - a gigantic sum - were embezzled for bribes to win massive contracts in countries prone to corruption .
investigators are feverishly searching for proof of corruption , for the perpetrators and for those responsible .
so far , no one believes that long-time ceo von pierer or his successor , kleinfeld , was personally involved in the scandal or even that they were aware of the bribes .
but they are nevertheless not free of responsibility .
how could millions and millions disappear into shady channels without the boss knowing anything about it ?
if that was the case , then there was a lack of control and control mechanisms .
perhaps the company 's executives did n't look too closely , because then an otherwise prevalent practice that led so nicely to large contracts would n't have worked anymore ?
that 's just a suspicion .
but it 's enough .
on top of it all comes a scandal within a scandal : siemens violated german law by putting millions of euros into the foundation of an employer-friendly organization to represent workers which was meant to undermine the trade union .
divide and conquer was the strategy .
it 's true that without a thorough clean-up at the top , siemens wo n't be able to make a credible new start .
however , the employers ' representatives in the supervisory board behaved extremely unprofessionally , causing the company further damage .
with nearly 500,000 employees , plants , joint ventures and offices in practically every country in the world , siemens is one of the biggest global companies - and now it has no leadership .
the concern is desperately searching for a new ceo .
that provides an ideal opportunity for carpetbaggers who long ago first suggested breaking up the company and selling off its individual parts .

" read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .
what we found in many of the incidents is that the shooters were , actually , treated unjustly .
in erfurt , -lrb- the shooter robert -rrb- steinhäuser had to leave school in the 12th grade .
and he was kicked out for quite a minor infraction .
at this point , he had nothing to do ; he was totally lost .
in emsdetten , the shooter was treated unfairly by his peers .
making procedures to deal with these could be a big step toward toward prevention . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virginia shooting causes shockwaves in germany 's erfurt the shock of the virginia shooting massacre is being echoed in the eastern german city of erfurt , where there were calls for tighter gun control laws after a student shot dead 16 people at his high school five years ago .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "
an unprecedented deployment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants the osce to get involved putin said the missile defense plan , if carried out , would mark an unprecedented deployment in europe of us strategic weaponry and said this was an issue that should be of concern not just in us-russian bilateral relations but on the continent as a whole .
" in one way or another , this affects the interests of all european states including those that are not members of nato , " putin said .
the russian leader said the matter should be taken up by the vienna-based organization for security and cooperation -lrb- osce -rrb- , a body that moscow has for years accused of veering from its original mission to deal with security matters in europe toward promotion of a us political agenda .
" it is time to give the activities of the osce some real content , to turn the face of the organization toward the problems that really concern the people of europe instead of only looking to build -lrb- political -rrb- blocs in the post-soviet space , " putin said . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense secretary winds up missile shield push in germany the united states will continue to consult with its allies and russia on washington 's plans to install a missile shield in europe , us defense secretary robert gates said in berlin .

" read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .

" read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .
what we found in many of the incidents is that the shooters were , actually , treated unjustly .

its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "

but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?

making procedures to deal with these could be a big step toward toward prevention . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virginia shooting causes shockwaves in germany 's erfurt the shock of the virginia shooting massacre is being echoed in the eastern german city of erfurt , where there were calls for tighter gun control laws after a student shot dead 16 people at his high school five years ago .

" read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .
what we found in many of the incidents is that the shooters were , actually , treated unjustly .
in erfurt , -lrb- the shooter robert -rrb- steinhäuser had to leave school in the 12th grade .
and he was kicked out for quite a minor infraction .
at this point , he had nothing to do ; he was totally lost .
in emsdetten , the shooter was treated unfairly by his peers .
making procedures to deal with these could be a big step toward toward prevention . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virginia shooting causes shockwaves in germany 's erfurt the shock of the virginia shooting massacre is being echoed in the eastern german city of erfurt , where there were calls for tighter gun control laws after a student shot dead 16 people at his high school five years ago .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "
an unprecedented deployment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants the osce to get involved putin said the missile defense plan , if carried out , would mark an unprecedented deployment in europe of us strategic weaponry and said this was an issue that should be of concern not just in us-russian bilateral relations but on the continent as a whole .
" in one way or another , this affects the interests of all european states including those that are not members of nato , " putin said .
the russian leader said the matter should be taken up by the vienna-based organization for security and cooperation -lrb- osce -rrb- , a body that moscow has for years accused of veering from its original mission to deal with security matters in europe toward promotion of a us political agenda .
" it is time to give the activities of the osce some real content , to turn the face of the organization toward the problems that really concern the people of europe instead of only looking to build -lrb- political -rrb- blocs in the post-soviet space , " putin said . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense secretary winds up missile shield push in germany the united states will continue to consult with its allies and russia on washington 's plans to install a missile shield in europe , us defense secretary robert gates said in berlin .

members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , who were present at a meeting of the committee on wednesday , reported fritsche ’ s comments to the press .
representatives from all political parties criticized the highly controversial practice as unlawful .
germany ’ s commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , told afp news service he thinks the practice is anti-constitutional , and said the matter would be looked into immediately .
meanwhile , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called for a change in the law for online computer monitoring .
spying allowed by schily the chancellor ’ s office said that in light of terrorism threats , examining pc hard drives is an " important intelligence tool . "
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far is too far ?
government spies have been accessing private data via the internet computer-monitoring by germany ’ s interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been possible since the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it , in june , 2005 .
according to the chancellor ’ s office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
social democratic interior committee chairman , sebastian edathy , told afp that schily ’ s regulations were " not a sustainable -lrb- legal -rrb- basis . "
the number of searches undertaken were only " in the single digits , " he said , but added that the parliament needed to give a " clear sign " that there are still insufficient legal grounds for carrying out such searches .
he also said he could imagine allowing such monitoring in particularly grievous cases , but then only under oversight of the court .
schäuble : ' let 's look at article 13 ' interior minister schäuble told parliament that online data searches should not be allowed without a legal foundation .
if the searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy , " then let ’ s think about whether we want to expand article 13 , " he said .
following the german federal court ’ s decision , schäuble had lobbied hard for a legal provision to allow police to do on-line searches .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "

members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , who were present at a meeting of the committee on wednesday , reported fritsche ’ s comments to the press .
representatives from all political parties criticized the highly controversial practice as unlawful .
germany ’ s commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , told afp news service he thinks the practice is anti-constitutional , and said the matter would be looked into immediately .
meanwhile , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called for a change in the law for online computer monitoring .

government spies have been accessing private data via the internet computer-monitoring by germany ’ s interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been possible since the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it , in june , 2005 .
according to the chancellor ’ s office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
social democratic interior committee chairman , sebastian edathy , told afp that schily ’ s regulations were " not a sustainable -lrb- legal -rrb- basis . "
the number of searches undertaken were only " in the single digits , " he said , but added that the parliament needed to give a " clear sign " that there are still insufficient legal grounds for carrying out such searches .
he also said he could imagine allowing such monitoring in particularly grievous cases , but then only under oversight of the court .

if the searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy , " then let ’ s think about whether we want to expand article 13 , " he said .
following the german federal court ’ s decision , schäuble had lobbied hard for a legal provision to allow police to do on-line searches .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are absolutely necessary , but they need a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "
an unprecedented deployment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants the osce to get involved putin said the missile defense plan , if carried out , would mark an unprecedented deployment in europe of us strategic weaponry and said this was an issue that should be of concern not just in us-russian bilateral relations but on the continent as a whole .
" in one way or another , this affects the interests of all european states including those that are not members of nato , " putin said .
the russian leader said the matter should be taken up by the vienna-based organization for security and cooperation -lrb- osce -rrb- , a body that moscow has for years accused of veering from its original mission to deal with security matters in europe toward promotion of a us political agenda .
" it is time to give the activities of the osce some real content , to turn the face of the organization toward the problems that really concern the people of europe instead of only looking to build -lrb- political -rrb- blocs in the post-soviet space , " putin said . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense secretary winds up missile shield push in germany the united states will continue to consult with its allies and russia on washington 's plans to install a missile shield in europe , us defense secretary robert gates said in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corporate governance -pipe- 26.04.2007 opinion : siemens mire bogs down ceo kleinfeld großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld said on wednesday he would leave the corruption-plagued firm by this autumn .
dw 's karl zawadzky comments on what the leadership crisis means for germany 's biggest electronics company . those who thought that supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer would be the last to go in connection with the siemens corruption scandal have been proven wrong : chief executive klaus kleinfeld will give up his post , too .
and he 's unlikely to be the last sacrifice in the executive suite .
siemens managerial board members are facing federal prosecutors ; one active member spent time in police custody as did a former board member .
in an open power struggle , the supervisory board refused to extend kleinfeld 's contract .
kleinfeld had no choice but to announce his voluntary resignation .
thus , he avoided getting fired .
the fate of top professionals at this globally active company is not the issue .
the issue is siemens itself .
the way the crisis has been managed is just as scandalous as the actual events that caused it .
up to 400 million euros -lrb- $ 540 million -rrb- - a gigantic sum - were embezzled for bribes to win massive contracts in countries prone to corruption .
investigators are feverishly searching for proof of corruption , for the perpetrators and for those responsible .
so far , no one believes that long-time ceo von pierer or his successor , kleinfeld , was personally involved in the scandal or even that they were aware of the bribes .
but they are nevertheless not free of responsibility .
how could millions and millions disappear into shady channels without the boss knowing anything about it ?
if that was the case , then there was a lack of control and control mechanisms .
perhaps the company 's executives did n't look too closely , because then an otherwise prevalent practice that led so nicely to large contracts would n't have worked anymore ?
that 's just a suspicion .
but it 's enough .
on top of it all comes a scandal within a scandal : siemens violated german law by putting millions of euros into the foundation of an employer-friendly organization to represent workers which was meant to undermine the trade union .
divide and conquer was the strategy .
it 's true that without a thorough clean-up at the top , siemens wo n't be able to make a credible new start .
however , the employers ' representatives in the supervisory board behaved extremely unprofessionally , causing the company further damage .
with nearly 500,000 employees , plants , joint ventures and offices in practically every country in the world , siemens is one of the biggest global companies - and now it has no leadership .
the concern is desperately searching for a new ceo .

dw 's karl zawadzky comments on what the leadership crisis means for germany 's biggest electronics company . those who thought that supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer would be the last to go in connection with the siemens corruption scandal have been proven wrong : chief executive klaus kleinfeld will give up his post , too .
and he 's unlikely to be the last sacrifice in the executive suite .
siemens managerial board members are facing federal prosecutors ; one active member spent time in police custody as did a former board member .
in an open power struggle , the supervisory board refused to extend kleinfeld 's contract .
kleinfeld had no choice but to announce his voluntary resignation .
thus , he avoided getting fired .
the fate of top professionals at this globally active company is not the issue .
the issue is siemens itself .
the way the crisis has been managed is just as scandalous as the actual events that caused it .
up to 400 million euros -lrb- $ 540 million -rrb- - a gigantic sum - were embezzled for bribes to win massive contracts in countries prone to corruption .
investigators are feverishly searching for proof of corruption , for the perpetrators and for those responsible .
so far , no one believes that long-time ceo von pierer or his successor , kleinfeld , was personally involved in the scandal or even that they were aware of the bribes .
but they are nevertheless not free of responsibility .
how could millions and millions disappear into shady channels without the boss knowing anything about it ?
if that was the case , then there was a lack of control and control mechanisms .
perhaps the company 's executives did n't look too closely , because then an otherwise prevalent practice that led so nicely to large contracts would n't have worked anymore ?
that 's just a suspicion .
but it 's enough .
on top of it all comes a scandal within a scandal : siemens violated german law by putting millions of euros into the foundation of an employer-friendly organization to represent workers which was meant to undermine the trade union .
divide and conquer was the strategy .
it 's true that without a thorough clean-up at the top , siemens wo n't be able to make a credible new start .
however , the employers ' representatives in the supervisory board behaved extremely unprofessionally , causing the company further damage .
with nearly 500,000 employees , plants , joint ventures and offices in practically every country in the world , siemens is one of the biggest global companies - and now it has no leadership .
the concern is desperately searching for a new ceo .
that provides an ideal opportunity for carpetbaggers who long ago first suggested breaking up the company and selling off its individual parts .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "
an unprecedented deployment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants the osce to get involved putin said the missile defense plan , if carried out , would mark an unprecedented deployment in europe of us strategic weaponry and said this was an issue that should be of concern not just in us-russian bilateral relations but on the continent as a whole .
" in one way or another , this affects the interests of all european states including those that are not members of nato , " putin said .
the russian leader said the matter should be taken up by the vienna-based organization for security and cooperation -lrb- osce -rrb- , a body that moscow has for years accused of veering from its original mission to deal with security matters in europe toward promotion of a us political agenda .
" it is time to give the activities of the osce some real content , to turn the face of the organization toward the problems that really concern the people of europe instead of only looking to build -lrb- political -rrb- blocs in the post-soviet space , " putin said . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense secretary winds up missile shield push in germany the united states will continue to consult with its allies and russia on washington 's plans to install a missile shield in europe , us defense secretary robert gates said in berlin .

bremen are the only non-spanish team left with osasuna meeting sevilla in the other semi . never before has spain managed to have three teams in the uefa semis , and the public interest in the competition is higher than ever , particularly since the proud football nation has no team left in the champions league .
understandably , there is even more media attention being paid to the osasuna-sevilla semi than to the espanyol-bremen tie .
but that 's just fine for werder 's opponents who are focused purely on getting a result at home and preventing the free-scoring germans from getting a vital away goal .
defender daniel jarque said on monday that " we have to stop them from scoring here . "
jarque added that " we really have to enjoy games like this , this is what we are footballers for . "
free-scoring werder a challenge for any team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espanyol midfielder moises hurtado , for his part , said on tuesday that " werder bremen are the big favourite to win the uefa cup ... they have an enormous offensive capacity and they are coming from the champions league . "
bremen were only narrowly eliminated in a tough champions league group with chelsea and barcelona .
boasting world cup top scorer miroslav klose and brazilian playmaker diego , bremen have overcome an early-spring slump and are in fine form again , on the heels of bundesliga leaders schalke and ready to deliver in the uefa cup as well .
" we are highly motivated .
every player dreams of these big matches .
we will do out utmost to claim both titles , in the league and in the uefa cup , " said diego .
klose said bremen has " no reason to hide " as the germans aim to take a first step towards preventing a final between two teams from one league which last came in 1998 when inter milan beat fellow- italians lazio .
title holders storming to second consecutive final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevilla hope to repeat these scenes next month holders sevilla are also hot favourites to reach the final again , though they rarely fare well in osasuna 's intimidating reino de navarra stadium .
sevilla coach juande ramos should have his entire squad available , given that andres palop , renato , adriano and frederic kanoute are all now fit and raring to go .
jose maria del nido , the ambitious president of sevilla , pointed out on monday , that his priority is to qualify for the champions league rather than retain the uefa cup or win the spanish king 's cup .
" the champions league is a strategic , sporting and economic objective which will permit us to increase our budget by about 30 per cent , " he claimed .
" the uefa cup and the king 's cup are important but our priority has to be getting in the champions league . "
sevilla are currently second in " la liga " , after thrashing athletic bilbao 4-1 on sunday .
osasuna 's only doubt concerns iranian international javad nekounam , who has been out since march 30 with a twisted knee .
midfielders francisco punal and ludovic delporte are both fit again after lengthy layoffs .
osasuna coach jose angel ziganda rested several key players in sunday 's 1-0 away to deportivo coruna , most notably enrique corrales , roberto soldado and savo milosevic .
osasuna defender carlos cuellar said on tuesday that sevilla are " a good team " but added that " we are certainly not afraid of them . "

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .
new age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff practically brought the berlin wall down now , there is knut - berlin 's cuddly sensation , the polar bear who was rejected by his mother , but adopted by an entire city .
unlike jfk and david hasselhoff , knut did n't want to become a berliner .
his idea of fun involves fish and freezing cold showers , not jelly doughnuts and screaming children .
but he had no saying in the whole matter and he is now the most famous living berliner , an overnight celebrity , a symbol of the fight against global warming and the hairiest celebrity ever to make the cover of vanity fair .
a new website called youknut - in reference to the popular internet video sharing site youtube - has been set up as a place for kunt fans to share their stories , songs and video about their favorite berliner .
one user posted a poem called " knut , oh knut , " while another used the site to announce he was looking for the nice girl he had met on the subway who wore the youknut badge .
and the cynics thought that there was no place for poetry or love in today 's world ?
the dark side of fame real celebrities always polarize .
think paris hilton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , knut , what a guy !
another german website , ominously called kill-knut.com , is built on the knowledge that the public almost always has a love-hate relationship with objects of their desire .
it invites its visitors to play online games involving their puffy white hero .
one is called " kill knut , " the other - " feed knut . "
the choice is yours .
if you are a hormonally imbalanced teenager or a disturbed person with unresolved aggression issues , you will try to shoot as many polar bears as possible .
if , on the other hand , you are an environmentally-conscious softie who eats organic food , wears sandals and hugs trees as a matter of principle , you can earn your game points by throwing fish at hyperactive polar bears .
for each polar bear shot or fed , you get one point .
the game statistics shows that cyber-killers seem more determined than cyber-feeders .
on april 26 , the reigning top " polar bear killer " had earned 39,400 points , whereas his " feeder " counterpart had collected only 30,000 .
if knut grows up to be a bitter old polar bear , it should come as no surprise at all . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germans might have a reputation of being a little grim and glum , but they 're not all sourpusses .
they can laugh or be laughable at times , and you can chuckle right along .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .
new age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff practically brought the berlin wall down now , there is knut - berlin 's cuddly sensation , the polar bear who was rejected by his mother , but adopted by an entire city .
unlike jfk and david hasselhoff , knut did n't want to become a berliner .
his idea of fun involves fish and freezing cold showers , not jelly doughnuts and screaming children .
but he had no saying in the whole matter and he is now the most famous living berliner , an overnight celebrity , a symbol of the fight against global warming and the hairiest celebrity ever to make the cover of vanity fair .
a new website called youknut - in reference to the popular internet video sharing site youtube - has been set up as a place for kunt fans to share their stories , songs and video about their favorite berliner .
one user posted a poem called " knut , oh knut , " while another used the site to announce he was looking for the nice girl he had met on the subway who wore the youknut badge .
and the cynics thought that there was no place for poetry or love in today 's world ?
the dark side of fame real celebrities always polarize .
think paris hilton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , knut , what a guy !
another german website , ominously called kill-knut.com , is built on the knowledge that the public almost always has a love-hate relationship with objects of their desire .
it invites its visitors to play online games involving their puffy white hero .
one is called " kill knut , " the other - " feed knut . "
the choice is yours .
if you are a hormonally imbalanced teenager or a disturbed person with unresolved aggression issues , you will try to shoot as many polar bears as possible .
if , on the other hand , you are an environmentally-conscious softie who eats organic food , wears sandals and hugs trees as a matter of principle , you can earn your game points by throwing fish at hyperactive polar bears .
for each polar bear shot or fed , you get one point .
the game statistics shows that cyber-killers seem more determined than cyber-feeders .
on april 26 , the reigning top " polar bear killer " had earned 39,400 points , whereas his " feeder " counterpart had collected only 30,000 .
if knut grows up to be a bitter old polar bear , it should come as no surprise at all . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germans might have a reputation of being a little grim and glum , but they 're not all sourpusses .
they can laugh or be laughable at times , and you can chuckle right along .
read up on the farcical side of germany .

german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .
here we almost look after every single colony . "
age factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honey as well as wax and royal jelly are products that come from beekeeping on the other hand , german apiary faces its own difficulties .
" beekeepers here tend to be loners , " said schricker , who has been studying bees since becoming a student of zoology in the 1960s .
" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .
politicians have n't realized the value of honey bees . "
age is also a major issue .
friedrich said federation members are , on average , 60 years old , while most of the people taking up the hobby also tend to be 40 and over .
the mobility required in today 's society makes it difficult to persuade young people to take up the hobby , she said .
" the age structure remains a problem , " friedrich said .
" the tendency is positive .
more women are joining .
up to now it has always tended to be a bit of a male domain .
but more beekeepers are dying than are taking up the hobby .
if we are to keep it alive , we need lots of new people . "
across the country , a whole variety of courses are on offer to introduce people all ages to beekeeping .
in bavaria , a leasing scheme has been launched to allow potential beekeepers to try out the pastime .
city bees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recruitment drive is on to find young beekeepers and although beekeeping has traditionally been very much a rural pastime that does not mean that city dwellers have to be excluded .
" even in berlin people keep bees , " schricker said .
" in allotments , on rooftop gardens and even on their balconies . "
a berlin bee has even been bred especially to suit urban conditions .
" it has certain characteristics such as docility and it is also attracted to blossom that you can find in the city - tree blossom mainly , " he said .
while people may not have to live in the country to become a beekeeper , a dollop of idealism helps .
the profits that can be made from selling hand-harvested honey tend to be limited .

german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .
here we almost look after every single colony . "
age factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honey as well as wax and royal jelly are products that come from beekeeping on the other hand , german apiary faces its own difficulties .
" beekeepers here tend to be loners , " said schricker , who has been studying bees since becoming a student of zoology in the 1960s .
" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .
politicians have n't realized the value of honey bees . "
age is also a major issue .
friedrich said federation members are , on average , 60 years old , while most of the people taking up the hobby also tend to be 40 and over .
the mobility required in today 's society makes it difficult to persuade young people to take up the hobby , she said .
" the age structure remains a problem , " friedrich said .
" the tendency is positive .
more women are joining .
up to now it has always tended to be a bit of a male domain .
but more beekeepers are dying than are taking up the hobby .
if we are to keep it alive , we need lots of new people . "
across the country , a whole variety of courses are on offer to introduce people all ages to beekeeping .
in bavaria , a leasing scheme has been launched to allow potential beekeepers to try out the pastime .
city bees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recruitment drive is on to find young beekeepers and although beekeeping has traditionally been very much a rural pastime that does not mean that city dwellers have to be excluded .
" even in berlin people keep bees , " schricker said .
" in allotments , on rooftop gardens and even on their balconies . "
a berlin bee has even been bred especially to suit urban conditions .
" it has certain characteristics such as docility and it is also attracted to blossom that you can find in the city - tree blossom mainly , " he said .
while people may not have to live in the country to become a beekeeper , a dollop of idealism helps .
the profits that can be made from selling hand-harvested honey tend to be limited .
" it 's a nice hobby , " schricker said .
" you also have to appreciate the social value too .
keeping bees is a very good way to react to climate change .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .

his idea of fun involves fish and freezing cold showers , not jelly doughnuts and screaming children .
but he had no saying in the whole matter and he is now the most famous living berliner , an overnight celebrity , a symbol of the fight against global warming and the hairiest celebrity ever to make the cover of vanity fair .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .
new age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff practically brought the berlin wall down now , there is knut - berlin 's cuddly sensation , the polar bear who was rejected by his mother , but adopted by an entire city .
unlike jfk and david hasselhoff , knut did n't want to become a berliner .
his idea of fun involves fish and freezing cold showers , not jelly doughnuts and screaming children .
but he had no saying in the whole matter and he is now the most famous living berliner , an overnight celebrity , a symbol of the fight against global warming and the hairiest celebrity ever to make the cover of vanity fair .
a new website called youknut - in reference to the popular internet video sharing site youtube - has been set up as a place for kunt fans to share their stories , songs and video about their favorite berliner .
one user posted a poem called " knut , oh knut , " while another used the site to announce he was looking for the nice girl he had met on the subway who wore the youknut badge .
and the cynics thought that there was no place for poetry or love in today 's world ?

now , he is going into television . former germany boss jürgen klinsmann revealed on thursday he is set to return to coaching and will be spending the summer considering job offers - from both clubs and countries . despite german press reports on thursday stating klinsmann had effectively ruled himself out of coaching english premiership champions chelsea by taking a job with german tv , the 42-year old insists he wants to coach again . klinsmann will work as an analyst and commentator for pay-tv channel arena for the next two years and will fly to germany from his home in california for major bundesliga games . the arena network has confirmed that klinsmann will get his own show on a two-year contract starting next season .
the show will feature commentary and analysis around bundesliga matches and important games in foreign leagues . " i do n't see myself as the classic tv expert , " said klinsmann , " but rather as an observer who enjoys football as much as the fans do . " competing for the star coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi was no stranger to tv during his tenure as coach but the ex-german striker insists he is also ready to coach again after taking a break having led germany to third-place at last year 's world cup on home soil . " whatever happens , i want to get back into the coaching game .
we 'll have to see whether that happens sooner or later , " klinsmann said at a press conference organised by arena . he said he has told his new employers he may be taking up a coaching role in the future after receiving offers " from teams and from national federations . " " i made sure arena are aware of that , so if i accepted a coaching post , our collaboration can be suspended at any time , " specified klinsmann .
" there are a certain number of proposals from clubs and national federations on the table , i am going to wait until this summer to analyse and sort out the offers to make a decision . " klinsmann would not specify which jobs he is considering , but he has been tipped to succeed jose mourinho at chelsea . tired , emotional and burnt out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching took a lot out of klinsi - but he will be back and the former tottenham , inter milan and bayern munich forward explained why he stood down as german coach , saying he was " burned out " after two years in charge and needed to " recharge his batteries " . " it was necessary that i took a break after the world cup , it was difficult for my family .
during the last 10 months , i have enjoyed a normal family life and i also took time to assess the world cup . " klinsmann had also been in talks with the united states soccer federation last year over its bid to replace incumbent us coach bruce arena with the california-based german soccer hero .
but in december , klinsmann gave up on the idea when it became clear that he would have no control over team matters .
bob bradley is now the interim boss of the us-team as it searches for a permanent replacement . earlier this year , klinsmann had also been informally approached by the australian team , according to australian media reports .
klinsmann was reported to have discussed real estate but also football business with peter lowy , the son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy . although the tv contract has put his career as a football coach on hold for at least two years , the charismatic klinsi recently dropped a hint that he might be back for the world cup 2010 .
" who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said at a fifa conference in berlin . from underdog to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with a german national hero klinsmann became a national hero when he led the german team to third place in last year 's world cup .
but he stepped down as germany head coach four days after the tournament , saying it was time to move on . klinsmann , who lives with his wife and two children in california , said then that his " big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them . "
he added that " after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " his new job as a television commentator is bound to afford the legendary klinsmann a more comfortable daily routine . in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , klinsmann endured scathing criticism from the tabloid press and some of his colleagues in the business .
critics viewed klinsmann 's coaching strategy with contempt , as he recruited many younger players into the team and was known for his unorthodox training methods .
klinsmann was also chided for his decision to commute to germany from california . but germany 's strong showing in the world cup took most observers - including germany fans - by surprise and silenced even the most relentless critics .
klinsmann subsequently became known as the " golden bomber " for his blonde hair and aggressive playing tactics . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said when it was over .
" we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . "
for that achievement , klinsmann was awarded the medal of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- by the german government . as a player , klinsmann claimed a world cup title in 1990 , when germany beat argentina 1-0 , and went on to play for france , italy and england .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "
an unprecedented deployment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants the osce to get involved putin said the missile defense plan , if carried out , would mark an unprecedented deployment in europe of us strategic weaponry and said this was an issue that should be of concern not just in us-russian bilateral relations but on the continent as a whole .
" in one way or another , this affects the interests of all european states including those that are not members of nato , " putin said .
the russian leader said the matter should be taken up by the vienna-based organization for security and cooperation -lrb- osce -rrb- , a body that moscow has for years accused of veering from its original mission to deal with security matters in europe toward promotion of a us political agenda .
" it is time to give the activities of the osce some real content , to turn the face of the organization toward the problems that really concern the people of europe instead of only looking to build -lrb- political -rrb- blocs in the post-soviet space , " putin said . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense secretary winds up missile shield push in germany the united states will continue to consult with its allies and russia on washington 's plans to install a missile shield in europe , us defense secretary robert gates said in berlin .
-lrb- 25.04.2007 -rrb- us battles to ease russian fears over missile shield the united states struggled thursday to ease russian fears about plans to extend its vast missile shield into europe , as moscow brushed off for the time being an offer to cooperate on the project .

now , he is going into television . former germany boss jürgen klinsmann revealed on thursday he is set to return to coaching and will be spending the summer considering job offers - from both clubs and countries . despite german press reports on thursday stating klinsmann had effectively ruled himself out of coaching english premiership champions chelsea by taking a job with german tv , the 42-year old insists he wants to coach again . klinsmann will work as an analyst and commentator for pay-tv channel arena for the next two years and will fly to germany from his home in california for major bundesliga games . the arena network has confirmed that klinsmann will get his own show on a two-year contract starting next season .
the show will feature commentary and analysis around bundesliga matches and important games in foreign leagues . " i do n't see myself as the classic tv expert , " said klinsmann , " but rather as an observer who enjoys football as much as the fans do . " competing for the star coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi was no stranger to tv during his tenure as coach but the ex-german striker insists he is also ready to coach again after taking a break having led germany to third-place at last year 's world cup on home soil . " whatever happens , i want to get back into the coaching game .
we 'll have to see whether that happens sooner or later , " klinsmann said at a press conference organised by arena . he said he has told his new employers he may be taking up a coaching role in the future after receiving offers " from teams and from national federations . " " i made sure arena are aware of that , so if i accepted a coaching post , our collaboration can be suspended at any time , " specified klinsmann .
" there are a certain number of proposals from clubs and national federations on the table , i am going to wait until this summer to analyse and sort out the offers to make a decision . " klinsmann would not specify which jobs he is considering , but he has been tipped to succeed jose mourinho at chelsea . tired , emotional and burnt out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching took a lot out of klinsi - but he will be back and the former tottenham , inter milan and bayern munich forward explained why he stood down as german coach , saying he was " burned out " after two years in charge and needed to " recharge his batteries " . " it was necessary that i took a break after the world cup , it was difficult for my family .
during the last 10 months , i have enjoyed a normal family life and i also took time to assess the world cup . " klinsmann had also been in talks with the united states soccer federation last year over its bid to replace incumbent us coach bruce arena with the california-based german soccer hero .
but in december , klinsmann gave up on the idea when it became clear that he would have no control over team matters .
bob bradley is now the interim boss of the us-team as it searches for a permanent replacement . earlier this year , klinsmann had also been informally approached by the australian team , according to australian media reports .
klinsmann was reported to have discussed real estate but also football business with peter lowy , the son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy . although the tv contract has put his career as a football coach on hold for at least two years , the charismatic klinsi recently dropped a hint that he might be back for the world cup 2010 .
" who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said at a fifa conference in berlin . from underdog to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with a german national hero klinsmann became a national hero when he led the german team to third place in last year 's world cup .
but he stepped down as germany head coach four days after the tournament , saying it was time to move on . klinsmann , who lives with his wife and two children in california , said then that his " big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them . "

guernica .
history of a painting " explores the genesis of a unique work that is considered by many as modern art 's most powerful anti-war symbol .
" picasso created a painting that is still very moving , " said director of the berlin wall museum alexandra hildebrandt .
" it does n't show airplanes or enemies .
it 's filled with dead and injured bodies .
it could 've carried the name of ' dresden ' or ' hiroshima . " '
" thanks to picasso 's famous painting , guernica 's name has not been forgotten , which is what happened to many other places with a similar destiny , " hildebrandt said .
the berlin exhibition , which opened on wednesday , has been set up by spanish book publisher and curator jacobo armero .
bildunterschrift : picasso 's " guernica " is a testimony to the power of art a symbol of national pride for many basques " guernica " is an important symbol of their national identity as the town is considered the centre of their cultural traditions .
the town was once home to an oak tree which spanish kings would stand beneath and vow to respect an ancient code giving the independent-minded basques special rights .
the tree survived the bombing but died during a heat wave in 2003 and was replaced two years later .
after franco won the civil war and established a dictatorship , picasso arranged for the museum of modern art -lrb- moma -rrb- in new york keep the painting for as long as he was in power .
during the vietnam war , the room housing " guernica " at the us museum became the site of occasional anti-war vigils .
franco died in 1975 - two years after picasso - and in 1981 the painting arrived in newly democratic spain where it was housed first in an annex of madrid 's prado museum before being moved to the reina sofia , which is named after spain 's current queen .

the frequent moves during this time damaged the painting and it is now very fragile , the head of the museum 's conservation department , jorge garcia , told afp last year .
" it is unthinkable to wrap it up again , anyone who desires this is crazy , " he said at the time .
the 70th anniversary of the bombing has also led to renewed calls for picasso 's painting to be put on display in the town .

members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , who were present at a meeting of the committee on wednesday , reported fritsche ’ s comments to the press .
representatives from all political parties criticized the highly controversial practice as unlawful .
germany ’ s commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , told afp news service he thinks the practice is anti-constitutional , and said the matter would be looked into immediately .
meanwhile , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called for a change in the law for online computer monitoring .

if the searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy , " then let ’ s think about whether we want to expand article 13 , " he said .

the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "

according to the chancellor ’ s office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
social democratic interior committee chairman , sebastian edathy , told afp that schily ’ s regulations were " not a sustainable -lrb- legal -rrb- basis . "
the number of searches undertaken were only " in the single digits , " he said , but added that the parliament needed to give a " clear sign " that there are still insufficient legal grounds for carrying out such searches .
he also said he could imagine allowing such monitoring in particularly grievous cases , but then only under oversight of the court .
schäuble : ' let 's look at article 13 ' interior minister schäuble told parliament that online data searches should not be allowed without a legal foundation .
if the searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy , " then let ’ s think about whether we want to expand article 13 , " he said .
following the german federal court ’ s decision , schäuble had lobbied hard for a legal provision to allow police to do on-line searches .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are absolutely necessary , but they need a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
the social democrats reproached them that the statements were meant to imply the spd is opposed to online searches , although " they themselves started the searches . "

" it is simply anti-constitutional , " she said .
greens party chief claudia roth said both intelligence agencies , the bfv and bnd , clearly consider " civil rights and informational self-determination from the perspective of a wrecking company . "
max stadler , interior expert from the liberal fdp party , called for the german government to terminate the searches instantly .
" lawmakers should keep their hands off of online searches , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
fdp parliamentarian gisela piltz said the budget for searches should be blocked .

now the tense calm that had reigned in their nearly 18 months in power is history .
the spat between the long-time rivals came to a head when volker kauder , the christian democrats ' parliamentary group leader and a member of merkel 's inner circle , accused social democrats of grandstanding at germany 's expense .
" the spd is damaging the country , " he told news channel n24 after leading social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- went on the attack over conservative proposals to slash corporate taxes and eliminate the inheritance tax .
a member of the spd 's board , andreas nahles , shot back on rbb radio that it was " unbelievable " that the christian democrats would call for the tax cuts in direct violation of the government 's original coalition agreement .
merkel enjoys limelight during its tenure , the " grand coalition " - the product of an inconclusive national election - merkel has deftly set the agenda and quashed dissent , sending her approval ratings soaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been feted in europe and elsewhere at the same time , the german economy - europe 's largest - has made a robust recovery , joblessness is falling and the public deficit is shrinking .
merkel has also basked in the limelight of the dual presidencies of the european union and the group of eight club of wealthy nations that she assumed in january .
off their game at the same time , the social democrats have struggled to seize on issues that resonate with their rank-and-file members and appeal to centrist voters .
the party has plummeted to just 27 percent backing in opinion polls versus 34 percent for merkel 's conservatives .
" the spd is now futilely trying to boost its profile on any number of issues , " laurenz meyer of the cdu 's parliamentary group gloated in an interview with the daily leipziger volkszeitung .
" the poll numbers are apparently taking their toll . "
the conservatives have used their advantage to go on the offensive on a range of issues , often catching the social democrats off guard .
guenther beckstein , the powerful conservative state interior minister in bavaria , infuriated social democrats when he said they would share the blame for a future terrorist attack in germany for opposing cdu plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen seems to have taken some pages from the spd 's book the parties have also reached an impasse on the spd 's call for a minimum wage in certain sectors .
the cdu argues it would be a job-killer .
and the conservative family affairs minister ursula von der leyen , a media-savvy mother of seven , has upstaged the social democrats with ambitious plans for expanding state-funded child care and family leave .
political paralysis " the spd is slowly realizing that the cdu / csu will not grant it any more major successes , " said the berlin daily tagesspiegel .
vice chancellor franz müntefering of the social democrats told public broadcaster zdf he was nevertheless confident the coalition would see out its four-year term , to 2009 .
" but we have to do better than we have done in recent weeks .
that 's for sure , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering recognizes that his party is losing the game as the social democrats cope with sinking poll ratings and the right-wing christian union parties dream of a future coalition with a smaller , less troublesome king-maker party , the result has been political paralysis in berlin .
" the cdu / csu and the spd are united by just one thought : when might be the right time to leave the coalition , citing a reason that could be made plausible ? " the center-left daily süddeutsche zeitung said .
" the hamburg -lrb- city-state -rrb- elections in february 2008 , just after a series of other state elections , are at the center of these considerations . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de uefa cup -pipe- 26.04.2007 bremen out to gatecrash spanish fiesta in uefa cup semis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all for one and one for all : bremen 's team spirit is driving them towards glory on two fronts werder bremen aim to crash the spanish uefa cup fiesta thursday when they play espanyol in the first leg of their semi-final tie .
bremen are the only non-spanish team left with osasuna meeting sevilla in the other semi . never before has spain managed to have three teams in the uefa semis , and the public interest in the competition is higher than ever , particularly since the proud football nation has no team left in the champions league .
understandably , there is even more media attention being paid to the osasuna-sevilla semi than to the espanyol-bremen tie .
but that 's just fine for werder 's opponents who are focused purely on getting a result at home and preventing the free-scoring germans from getting a vital away goal .
defender daniel jarque said on monday that " we have to stop them from scoring here . "
jarque added that " we really have to enjoy games like this , this is what we are footballers for . "
free-scoring werder a challenge for any team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espanyol midfielder moises hurtado , for his part , said on tuesday that " werder bremen are the big favourite to win the uefa cup ... they have an enormous offensive capacity and they are coming from the champions league . "
bremen were only narrowly eliminated in a tough champions league group with chelsea and barcelona .
boasting world cup top scorer miroslav klose and brazilian playmaker diego , bremen have overcome an early-spring slump and are in fine form again , on the heels of bundesliga leaders schalke and ready to deliver in the uefa cup as well .
" we are highly motivated .
every player dreams of these big matches .
we will do out utmost to claim both titles , in the league and in the uefa cup , " said diego .
klose said bremen has " no reason to hide " as the germans aim to take a first step towards preventing a final between two teams from one league which last came in 1998 when inter milan beat fellow- italians lazio .
title holders storming to second consecutive final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sevilla hope to repeat these scenes next month holders sevilla are also hot favourites to reach the final again , though they rarely fare well in osasuna 's intimidating reino de navarra stadium .
sevilla coach juande ramos should have his entire squad available , given that andres palop , renato , adriano and frederic kanoute are all now fit and raring to go .
jose maria del nido , the ambitious president of sevilla , pointed out on monday , that his priority is to qualify for the champions league rather than retain the uefa cup or win the spanish king 's cup .
" the champions league is a strategic , sporting and economic objective which will permit us to increase our budget by about 30 per cent , " he claimed .
" the uefa cup and the king 's cup are important but our priority has to be getting in the champions league . "
sevilla are currently second in " la liga " , after thrashing athletic bilbao 4-1 on sunday .

" read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .
what we found in many of the incidents is that the shooters were , actually , treated unjustly .
in erfurt , -lrb- the shooter robert -rrb- steinhäuser had to leave school in the 12th grade .
and he was kicked out for quite a minor infraction .
at this point , he had nothing to do ; he was totally lost .
in emsdetten , the shooter was treated unfairly by his peers .
making procedures to deal with these could be a big step toward toward prevention . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virginia shooting causes shockwaves in germany 's erfurt the shock of the virginia shooting massacre is being echoed in the eastern german city of erfurt , where there were calls for tighter gun control laws after a student shot dead 16 people at his high school five years ago .

so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .
what we found in many of the incidents is that the shooters were , actually , treated unjustly .
in erfurt , -lrb- the shooter robert -rrb- steinhäuser had to leave school in the 12th grade .
and he was kicked out for quite a minor infraction .
at this point , he had nothing to do ; he was totally lost .
in emsdetten , the shooter was treated unfairly by his peers .
making procedures to deal with these could be a big step toward toward prevention . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virginia shooting causes shockwaves in germany 's erfurt the shock of the virginia shooting massacre is being echoed in the eastern german city of erfurt , where there were calls for tighter gun control laws after a student shot dead 16 people at his high school five years ago .

" read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .

they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .
what we found in many of the incidents is that the shooters were , actually , treated unjustly .
in erfurt , -lrb- the shooter robert -rrb- steinhäuser had to leave school in the 12th grade .
and he was kicked out for quite a minor infraction .
at this point , he had nothing to do ; he was totally lost .
in emsdetten , the shooter was treated unfairly by his peers .
making procedures to deal with these could be a big step toward toward prevention . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virginia shooting causes shockwaves in germany 's erfurt the shock of the virginia shooting massacre is being echoed in the eastern german city of erfurt , where there were calls for tighter gun control laws after a student shot dead 16 people at his high school five years ago .

dw 's karl zawadzky comments on what the leadership crisis means for germany 's biggest electronics company . those who thought that supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer would be the last to go in connection with the siemens corruption scandal have been proven wrong : chief executive klaus kleinfeld will give up his post , too .
and he 's unlikely to be the last sacrifice in the executive suite .
siemens managerial board members are facing federal prosecutors ; one active member spent time in police custody as did a former board member .
in an open power struggle , the supervisory board refused to extend kleinfeld 's contract .
kleinfeld had no choice but to announce his voluntary resignation .
thus , he avoided getting fired .
the fate of top professionals at this globally active company is not the issue .
the issue is siemens itself .
the way the crisis has been managed is just as scandalous as the actual events that caused it .
up to 400 million euros -lrb- $ 540 million -rrb- - a gigantic sum - were embezzled for bribes to win massive contracts in countries prone to corruption .
investigators are feverishly searching for proof of corruption , for the perpetrators and for those responsible .
so far , no one believes that long-time ceo von pierer or his successor , kleinfeld , was personally involved in the scandal or even that they were aware of the bribes .
but they are nevertheless not free of responsibility .
how could millions and millions disappear into shady channels without the boss knowing anything about it ?
if that was the case , then there was a lack of control and control mechanisms .
perhaps the company 's executives did n't look too closely , because then an otherwise prevalent practice that led so nicely to large contracts would n't have worked anymore ?
that 's just a suspicion .
but it 's enough .
on top of it all comes a scandal within a scandal : siemens violated german law by putting millions of euros into the foundation of an employer-friendly organization to represent workers which was meant to undermine the trade union .
divide and conquer was the strategy .
it 's true that without a thorough clean-up at the top , siemens wo n't be able to make a credible new start .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "
an unprecedented deployment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants the osce to get involved putin said the missile defense plan , if carried out , would mark an unprecedented deployment in europe of us strategic weaponry and said this was an issue that should be of concern not just in us-russian bilateral relations but on the continent as a whole .
" in one way or another , this affects the interests of all european states including those that are not members of nato , " putin said .
the russian leader said the matter should be taken up by the vienna-based organization for security and cooperation -lrb- osce -rrb- , a body that moscow has for years accused of veering from its original mission to deal with security matters in europe toward promotion of a us political agenda .
" it is time to give the activities of the osce some real content , to turn the face of the organization toward the problems that really concern the people of europe instead of only looking to build -lrb- political -rrb- blocs in the post-soviet space , " putin said . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense secretary winds up missile shield push in germany the united states will continue to consult with its allies and russia on washington 's plans to install a missile shield in europe , us defense secretary robert gates said in berlin .

" it is time to give the activities of the osce some real content , to turn the face of the organization toward the problems that really concern the people of europe instead of only looking to build -lrb- political -rrb- blocs in the post-soviet space , " putin said . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense secretary winds up missile shield push in germany the united states will continue to consult with its allies and russia on washington 's plans to install a missile shield in europe , us defense secretary robert gates said in berlin .

but in last weekend 's loss to stuttgart , munich ran out of luck - to many fans ' delight . with nineteen bundesliga titles to their name , bayern munich are used to lording it over the rest of the league .
munich haters often refer to their new stadium , the allianzarena as the " arrogance arena , " and bayern president franz beckenbauer once dismissed the uefa cup as a competition for losers . but the uefa cup - and not , as is customary , the champions league - is precisely where bayern would be if the season ended today .
five points behind third-place stuttgart , once-mighty munich will struggle to salvage anything from this season . and the prospect of seeing the bundesliga 's titan drop into the ranks of the also-rans for the first time in more than a decade has many fans rubbing their hands with glee . the tabloid bild newspaper described the team as " idiots " and " losers in lederhosen " after their desultory performance in stuttgart .
and the bz newspaper wrote : " they used to brag that they were stronger than ox .
but now they 're the ones getting gored . " throwing money at the problem could be a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger is one of many who have disappointed bayern 's bosses have already said they will revamp the squad in the off-season , and bloggers on throughout germany are relishing the prospect of seeing the bundesliga 's richest club have to break open the piggy bank . bayern 's biggest need , everyone agrees , is a creative midfielder .
neither mark van bommel , who 's more of a workhorse , nor bastian schweinsteiger , who 's more comfortable on the wing , have been able the play the role previously filled by stefan effenberg , mehmet scholl and michael ballack . but if bayern are only competing in the uefa cup next season , it 's unlikely that they can attract a top international playmaker - no matter how much they loosen the purse-strings . and the typical bayern strategy of luring away players from other bundesliga sides may not work either .
the best playmaker in the league , bremen 's diego , has already said he 's not interested in offers from munich .
schalke 's lincoln and hamburg 's raphael van der vaart have made similar statements . rebuilding or regression ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ottmar hitzfeld has n't been able top turn things around bayern will start to try and salvage the season this weekend at home to hamburg , but it 's an uphill battle .
coach ottmar hitzfeld says he hopes he will have seven or eight new players with whom he can stage a comeback next year . but even some bayern fans are questioning whether hitzfeld , who led the club in its glory years around the millennium , is up to the job . " for me he 's the wrong coach to clean up the club , " wrote one blogger .
" on the contrary , he fits perfectly with the current system . " bayern brought back hitzfeld this february to replace felix magath , but his record has been worse than his predecessor 's . and some fans blame management for poor personnel decisions .
" i do n't think the magical troika -lrb- of uli hoeneß , karl-heinz rummenigge and franz beckenbauer -rrb- know how the club should develop , " another disappointed supporter wrote .
" it never occurs to them that they might be to blame for things not going well . " when commercial manager uli hoeneß cautioned bayern fans at beginning of the 2006-7 campaign that this would be a transitional season , most supporters thought he was being over-cautious .
now they know better . " a ' transitional season , " ' one fan sighed in an internet post .
" all well and good .

now the tense calm that had reigned in their nearly 18 months in power is history .
the spat between the long-time rivals came to a head when volker kauder , the christian democrats ' parliamentary group leader and a member of merkel 's inner circle , accused social democrats of grandstanding at germany 's expense .
" the spd is damaging the country , " he told news channel n24 after leading social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- went on the attack over conservative proposals to slash corporate taxes and eliminate the inheritance tax .
a member of the spd 's board , andreas nahles , shot back on rbb radio that it was " unbelievable " that the christian democrats would call for the tax cuts in direct violation of the government 's original coalition agreement .
merkel enjoys limelight during its tenure , the " grand coalition " - the product of an inconclusive national election - merkel has deftly set the agenda and quashed dissent , sending her approval ratings soaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been feted in europe and elsewhere at the same time , the german economy - europe 's largest - has made a robust recovery , joblessness is falling and the public deficit is shrinking .
merkel has also basked in the limelight of the dual presidencies of the european union and the group of eight club of wealthy nations that she assumed in january .
off their game at the same time , the social democrats have struggled to seize on issues that resonate with their rank-and-file members and appeal to centrist voters .
the party has plummeted to just 27 percent backing in opinion polls versus 34 percent for merkel 's conservatives .
" the spd is now futilely trying to boost its profile on any number of issues , " laurenz meyer of the cdu 's parliamentary group gloated in an interview with the daily leipziger volkszeitung .
" the poll numbers are apparently taking their toll . "
the conservatives have used their advantage to go on the offensive on a range of issues , often catching the social democrats off guard .
guenther beckstein , the powerful conservative state interior minister in bavaria , infuriated social democrats when he said they would share the blame for a future terrorist attack in germany for opposing cdu plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen seems to have taken some pages from the spd 's book the parties have also reached an impasse on the spd 's call for a minimum wage in certain sectors .
the cdu argues it would be a job-killer .
and the conservative family affairs minister ursula von der leyen , a media-savvy mother of seven , has upstaged the social democrats with ambitious plans for expanding state-funded child care and family leave .
political paralysis " the spd is slowly realizing that the cdu / csu will not grant it any more major successes , " said the berlin daily tagesspiegel .
vice chancellor franz müntefering of the social democrats told public broadcaster zdf he was nevertheless confident the coalition would see out its four-year term , to 2009 .
" but we have to do better than we have done in recent weeks .
that 's for sure , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering recognizes that his party is losing the game as the social democrats cope with sinking poll ratings and the right-wing christian union parties dream of a future coalition with a smaller , less troublesome king-maker party , the result has been political paralysis in berlin .
" the cdu / csu and the spd are united by just one thought : when might be the right time to leave the coalition , citing a reason that could be made plausible ? " the center-left daily süddeutsche zeitung said .
" the hamburg -lrb- city-state -rrb- elections in february 2008 , just after a series of other state elections , are at the center of these considerations . "
despite the friction , few observers thought the government would fall .
" the coalition will not collapse now , but the aversion is growing , " the left-leaning daily frankfurter rundschau wrote . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top german politicians argue over measures to fight terrorism german politicians are at odds over a minister 's remark that the presumption of innocence does n't apply to suspected terrorists , as the cabinet on wednesday decided on new measures in the fight against terror .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders society -pipe- 26.04.2007 school violence : " we need to recognize the risk signals " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why ? " read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .
what we found in many of the incidents is that the shooters were , actually , treated unjustly .
in erfurt , -lrb- the shooter robert -rrb- steinhäuser had to leave school in the 12th grade .
and he was kicked out for quite a minor infraction .
at this point , he had nothing to do ; he was totally lost .
in emsdetten , the shooter was treated unfairly by his peers .
making procedures to deal with these could be a big step toward toward prevention . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virginia shooting causes shockwaves in germany 's erfurt the shock of the virginia shooting massacre is being echoed in the eastern german city of erfurt , where there were calls for tighter gun control laws after a student shot dead 16 people at his high school five years ago .

in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .
what we found in many of the incidents is that the shooters were , actually , treated unjustly .
in erfurt , -lrb- the shooter robert -rrb- steinhäuser had to leave school in the 12th grade .
and he was kicked out for quite a minor infraction .
at this point , he had nothing to do ; he was totally lost .
in emsdetten , the shooter was treated unfairly by his peers .
making procedures to deal with these could be a big step toward toward prevention . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virginia shooting causes shockwaves in germany 's erfurt the shock of the virginia shooting massacre is being echoed in the eastern german city of erfurt , where there were calls for tighter gun control laws after a student shot dead 16 people at his high school five years ago .

" read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .

" read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .

now the tense calm that had reigned in their nearly 18 months in power is history .

members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , who were present at a meeting of the committee on wednesday , reported fritsche ’ s comments to the press .
representatives from all political parties criticized the highly controversial practice as unlawful .
germany ’ s commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , told afp news service he thinks the practice is anti-constitutional , and said the matter would be looked into immediately .
meanwhile , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called for a change in the law for online computer monitoring .
spying allowed by schily the chancellor ’ s office said that in light of terrorism threats , examining pc hard drives is an " important intelligence tool . "
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far is too far ?
government spies have been accessing private data via the internet computer-monitoring by germany ’ s interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been possible since the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it , in june , 2005 .
according to the chancellor ’ s office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
social democratic interior committee chairman , sebastian edathy , told afp that schily ’ s regulations were " not a sustainable -lrb- legal -rrb- basis . "
the number of searches undertaken were only " in the single digits , " he said , but added that the parliament needed to give a " clear sign " that there are still insufficient legal grounds for carrying out such searches .
he also said he could imagine allowing such monitoring in particularly grievous cases , but then only under oversight of the court .
schäuble : ' let 's look at article 13 ' interior minister schäuble told parliament that online data searches should not be allowed without a legal foundation .
if the searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy , " then let ’ s think about whether we want to expand article 13 , " he said .
following the german federal court ’ s decision , schäuble had lobbied hard for a legal provision to allow police to do on-line searches .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are absolutely necessary , but they need a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
the social democrats reproached them that the statements were meant to imply the spd is opposed to online searches , although " they themselves started the searches . "
opposition is outspoken bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat schily signed work decrees on spying in 2005 green party interior expert silke stokar told afp news service that the " secret working decrees " acted to bypass parliament .
" it is simply anti-constitutional , " she said .
greens party chief claudia roth said both intelligence agencies , the bfv and bnd , clearly consider " civil rights and informational self-determination from the perspective of a wrecking company . "
max stadler , interior expert from the liberal fdp party , called for the german government to terminate the searches instantly .
" lawmakers should keep their hands off of online searches , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .

but in last weekend 's loss to stuttgart , munich ran out of luck - to many fans ' delight . with nineteen bundesliga titles to their name , bayern munich are used to lording it over the rest of the league .
munich haters often refer to their new stadium , the allianzarena as the " arrogance arena , " and bayern president franz beckenbauer once dismissed the uefa cup as a competition for losers . but the uefa cup - and not , as is customary , the champions league - is precisely where bayern would be if the season ended today .
five points behind third-place stuttgart , once-mighty munich will struggle to salvage anything from this season . and the prospect of seeing the bundesliga 's titan drop into the ranks of the also-rans for the first time in more than a decade has many fans rubbing their hands with glee . the tabloid bild newspaper described the team as " idiots " and " losers in lederhosen " after their desultory performance in stuttgart .
and the bz newspaper wrote : " they used to brag that they were stronger than ox .
but now they 're the ones getting gored . " throwing money at the problem could be a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger is one of many who have disappointed bayern 's bosses have already said they will revamp the squad in the off-season , and bloggers on throughout germany are relishing the prospect of seeing the bundesliga 's richest club have to break open the piggy bank . bayern 's biggest need , everyone agrees , is a creative midfielder .
neither mark van bommel , who 's more of a workhorse , nor bastian schweinsteiger , who 's more comfortable on the wing , have been able the play the role previously filled by stefan effenberg , mehmet scholl and michael ballack . but if bayern are only competing in the uefa cup next season , it 's unlikely that they can attract a top international playmaker - no matter how much they loosen the purse-strings . and the typical bayern strategy of luring away players from other bundesliga sides may not work either .
the best playmaker in the league , bremen 's diego , has already said he 's not interested in offers from munich .
schalke 's lincoln and hamburg 's raphael van der vaart have made similar statements . rebuilding or regression ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ottmar hitzfeld has n't been able top turn things around bayern will start to try and salvage the season this weekend at home to hamburg , but it 's an uphill battle .
coach ottmar hitzfeld says he hopes he will have seven or eight new players with whom he can stage a comeback next year . but even some bayern fans are questioning whether hitzfeld , who led the club in its glory years around the millennium , is up to the job . " for me he 's the wrong coach to clean up the club , " wrote one blogger .
" on the contrary , he fits perfectly with the current system . " bayern brought back hitzfeld this february to replace felix magath , but his record has been worse than his predecessor 's . and some fans blame management for poor personnel decisions .
" i do n't think the magical troika -lrb- of uli hoeneß , karl-heinz rummenigge and franz beckenbauer -rrb- know how the club should develop , " another disappointed supporter wrote .
" it never occurs to them that they might be to blame for things not going well . " when commercial manager uli hoeneß cautioned bayern fans at beginning of the 2006-7 campaign that this would be a transitional season , most supporters thought he was being over-cautious .
now they know better . " a ' transitional season , " ' one fan sighed in an internet post .
" all well and good .
but at the moment , it looks to me like a transition from the top of the table to mediocrity .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "

dw 's karl zawadzky comments on what the leadership crisis means for germany 's biggest electronics company . those who thought that supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer would be the last to go in connection with the siemens corruption scandal have been proven wrong : chief executive klaus kleinfeld will give up his post , too .
and he 's unlikely to be the last sacrifice in the executive suite .
siemens managerial board members are facing federal prosecutors ; one active member spent time in police custody as did a former board member .
in an open power struggle , the supervisory board refused to extend kleinfeld 's contract .
kleinfeld had no choice but to announce his voluntary resignation .
thus , he avoided getting fired .
the fate of top professionals at this globally active company is not the issue .
the issue is siemens itself .
the way the crisis has been managed is just as scandalous as the actual events that caused it .
up to 400 million euros -lrb- $ 540 million -rrb- - a gigantic sum - were embezzled for bribes to win massive contracts in countries prone to corruption .
investigators are feverishly searching for proof of corruption , for the perpetrators and for those responsible .
so far , no one believes that long-time ceo von pierer or his successor , kleinfeld , was personally involved in the scandal or even that they were aware of the bribes .
but they are nevertheless not free of responsibility .
how could millions and millions disappear into shady channels without the boss knowing anything about it ?
if that was the case , then there was a lack of control and control mechanisms .
perhaps the company 's executives did n't look too closely , because then an otherwise prevalent practice that led so nicely to large contracts would n't have worked anymore ?
that 's just a suspicion .
but it 's enough .
on top of it all comes a scandal within a scandal : siemens violated german law by putting millions of euros into the foundation of an employer-friendly organization to represent workers which was meant to undermine the trade union .
divide and conquer was the strategy .
it 's true that without a thorough clean-up at the top , siemens wo n't be able to make a credible new start .
however , the employers ' representatives in the supervisory board behaved extremely unprofessionally , causing the company further damage .
with nearly 500,000 employees , plants , joint ventures and offices in practically every country in the world , siemens is one of the biggest global companies - and now it has no leadership .
the concern is desperately searching for a new ceo .
that provides an ideal opportunity for carpetbaggers who long ago first suggested breaking up the company and selling off its individual parts .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "
an unprecedented deployment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants the osce to get involved putin said the missile defense plan , if carried out , would mark an unprecedented deployment in europe of us strategic weaponry and said this was an issue that should be of concern not just in us-russian bilateral relations but on the continent as a whole .
" in one way or another , this affects the interests of all european states including those that are not members of nato , " putin said .
the russian leader said the matter should be taken up by the vienna-based organization for security and cooperation -lrb- osce -rrb- , a body that moscow has for years accused of veering from its original mission to deal with security matters in europe toward promotion of a us political agenda .
" it is time to give the activities of the osce some real content , to turn the face of the organization toward the problems that really concern the people of europe instead of only looking to build -lrb- political -rrb- blocs in the post-soviet space , " putin said . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense secretary winds up missile shield push in germany the united states will continue to consult with its allies and russia on washington 's plans to install a missile shield in europe , us defense secretary robert gates said in berlin .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "
an unprecedented deployment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants the osce to get involved putin said the missile defense plan , if carried out , would mark an unprecedented deployment in europe of us strategic weaponry and said this was an issue that should be of concern not just in us-russian bilateral relations but on the continent as a whole .
" in one way or another , this affects the interests of all european states including those that are not members of nato , " putin said .
the russian leader said the matter should be taken up by the vienna-based organization for security and cooperation -lrb- osce -rrb- , a body that moscow has for years accused of veering from its original mission to deal with security matters in europe toward promotion of a us political agenda .
" it is time to give the activities of the osce some real content , to turn the face of the organization toward the problems that really concern the people of europe instead of only looking to build -lrb- political -rrb- blocs in the post-soviet space , " putin said . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense secretary winds up missile shield push in germany the united states will continue to consult with its allies and russia on washington 's plans to install a missile shield in europe , us defense secretary robert gates said in berlin .

neither mark van bommel , who 's more of a workhorse , nor bastian schweinsteiger , who 's more comfortable on the wing , have been able the play the role previously filled by stefan effenberg , mehmet scholl and michael ballack . but if bayern are only competing in the uefa cup next season , it 's unlikely that they can attract a top international playmaker - no matter how much they loosen the purse-strings . and the typical bayern strategy of luring away players from other bundesliga sides may not work either .
the best playmaker in the league , bremen 's diego , has already said he 's not interested in offers from munich .
schalke 's lincoln and hamburg 's raphael van der vaart have made similar statements . rebuilding or regression ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ottmar hitzfeld has n't been able top turn things around bayern will start to try and salvage the season this weekend at home to hamburg , but it 's an uphill battle .
coach ottmar hitzfeld says he hopes he will have seven or eight new players with whom he can stage a comeback next year . but even some bayern fans are questioning whether hitzfeld , who led the club in its glory years around the millennium , is up to the job . " for me he 's the wrong coach to clean up the club , " wrote one blogger .
" on the contrary , he fits perfectly with the current system . " bayern brought back hitzfeld this february to replace felix magath , but his record has been worse than his predecessor 's . and some fans blame management for poor personnel decisions .
" i do n't think the magical troika -lrb- of uli hoeneß , karl-heinz rummenigge and franz beckenbauer -rrb- know how the club should develop , " another disappointed supporter wrote .
" it never occurs to them that they might be to blame for things not going well . " when commercial manager uli hoeneß cautioned bayern fans at beginning of the 2006-7 campaign that this would be a transitional season , most supporters thought he was being over-cautious .
now they know better . " a ' transitional season , " ' one fan sighed in an internet post .
" all well and good .

now , he is going into television . former germany boss jürgen klinsmann revealed on thursday he is set to return to coaching and will be spending the summer considering job offers - from both clubs and countries . despite german press reports on thursday stating klinsmann had effectively ruled himself out of coaching english premiership champions chelsea by taking a job with german tv , the 42-year old insists he wants to coach again . klinsmann will work as an analyst and commentator for pay-tv channel arena for the next two years and will fly to germany from his home in california for major bundesliga games . the arena network has confirmed that klinsmann will get his own show on a two-year contract starting next season .
the show will feature commentary and analysis around bundesliga matches and important games in foreign leagues . " i do n't see myself as the classic tv expert , " said klinsmann , " but rather as an observer who enjoys football as much as the fans do . " competing for the star coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi was no stranger to tv during his tenure as coach but the ex-german striker insists he is also ready to coach again after taking a break having led germany to third-place at last year 's world cup on home soil . " whatever happens , i want to get back into the coaching game .
we 'll have to see whether that happens sooner or later , " klinsmann said at a press conference organised by arena . he said he has told his new employers he may be taking up a coaching role in the future after receiving offers " from teams and from national federations . " " i made sure arena are aware of that , so if i accepted a coaching post , our collaboration can be suspended at any time , " specified klinsmann .
" there are a certain number of proposals from clubs and national federations on the table , i am going to wait until this summer to analyse and sort out the offers to make a decision . " klinsmann would not specify which jobs he is considering , but he has been tipped to succeed jose mourinho at chelsea . tired , emotional and burnt out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching took a lot out of klinsi - but he will be back and the former tottenham , inter milan and bayern munich forward explained why he stood down as german coach , saying he was " burned out " after two years in charge and needed to " recharge his batteries " . " it was necessary that i took a break after the world cup , it was difficult for my family .
during the last 10 months , i have enjoyed a normal family life and i also took time to assess the world cup . " klinsmann had also been in talks with the united states soccer federation last year over its bid to replace incumbent us coach bruce arena with the california-based german soccer hero .
but in december , klinsmann gave up on the idea when it became clear that he would have no control over team matters .
bob bradley is now the interim boss of the us-team as it searches for a permanent replacement . earlier this year , klinsmann had also been informally approached by the australian team , according to australian media reports .
klinsmann was reported to have discussed real estate but also football business with peter lowy , the son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy . although the tv contract has put his career as a football coach on hold for at least two years , the charismatic klinsi recently dropped a hint that he might be back for the world cup 2010 .
" who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said at a fifa conference in berlin . from underdog to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with a german national hero klinsmann became a national hero when he led the german team to third place in last year 's world cup .
but he stepped down as germany head coach four days after the tournament , saying it was time to move on . klinsmann , who lives with his wife and two children in california , said then that his " big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them . "
he added that " after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " his new job as a television commentator is bound to afford the legendary klinsmann a more comfortable daily routine . in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , klinsmann endured scathing criticism from the tabloid press and some of his colleagues in the business .
critics viewed klinsmann 's coaching strategy with contempt , as he recruited many younger players into the team and was known for his unorthodox training methods .
klinsmann was also chided for his decision to commute to germany from california . but germany 's strong showing in the world cup took most observers - including germany fans - by surprise and silenced even the most relentless critics .
klinsmann subsequently became known as the " golden bomber " for his blonde hair and aggressive playing tactics . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said when it was over .
" we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . "
for that achievement , klinsmann was awarded the medal of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- by the german government . as a player , klinsmann claimed a world cup title in 1990 , when germany beat argentina 1-0 , and went on to play for france , italy and england .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .

now , he is going into television . former germany boss jürgen klinsmann revealed on thursday he is set to return to coaching and will be spending the summer considering job offers - from both clubs and countries . despite german press reports on thursday stating klinsmann had effectively ruled himself out of coaching english premiership champions chelsea by taking a job with german tv , the 42-year old insists he wants to coach again . klinsmann will work as an analyst and commentator for pay-tv channel arena for the next two years and will fly to germany from his home in california for major bundesliga games . the arena network has confirmed that klinsmann will get his own show on a two-year contract starting next season .
the show will feature commentary and analysis around bundesliga matches and important games in foreign leagues . " i do n't see myself as the classic tv expert , " said klinsmann , " but rather as an observer who enjoys football as much as the fans do . " competing for the star coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi was no stranger to tv during his tenure as coach but the ex-german striker insists he is also ready to coach again after taking a break having led germany to third-place at last year 's world cup on home soil . " whatever happens , i want to get back into the coaching game .
we 'll have to see whether that happens sooner or later , " klinsmann said at a press conference organised by arena . he said he has told his new employers he may be taking up a coaching role in the future after receiving offers " from teams and from national federations . " " i made sure arena are aware of that , so if i accepted a coaching post , our collaboration can be suspended at any time , " specified klinsmann .
" there are a certain number of proposals from clubs and national federations on the table , i am going to wait until this summer to analyse and sort out the offers to make a decision . " klinsmann would not specify which jobs he is considering , but he has been tipped to succeed jose mourinho at chelsea . tired , emotional and burnt out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching took a lot out of klinsi - but he will be back and the former tottenham , inter milan and bayern munich forward explained why he stood down as german coach , saying he was " burned out " after two years in charge and needed to " recharge his batteries " . " it was necessary that i took a break after the world cup , it was difficult for my family .
during the last 10 months , i have enjoyed a normal family life and i also took time to assess the world cup . " klinsmann had also been in talks with the united states soccer federation last year over its bid to replace incumbent us coach bruce arena with the california-based german soccer hero .
but in december , klinsmann gave up on the idea when it became clear that he would have no control over team matters .
bob bradley is now the interim boss of the us-team as it searches for a permanent replacement . earlier this year , klinsmann had also been informally approached by the australian team , according to australian media reports .
klinsmann was reported to have discussed real estate but also football business with peter lowy , the son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy . although the tv contract has put his career as a football coach on hold for at least two years , the charismatic klinsi recently dropped a hint that he might be back for the world cup 2010 .
" who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said at a fifa conference in berlin . from underdog to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with a german national hero klinsmann became a national hero when he led the german team to third place in last year 's world cup .
but he stepped down as germany head coach four days after the tournament , saying it was time to move on . klinsmann , who lives with his wife and two children in california , said then that his " big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them . "
he added that " after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " his new job as a television commentator is bound to afford the legendary klinsmann a more comfortable daily routine . in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , klinsmann endured scathing criticism from the tabloid press and some of his colleagues in the business .
critics viewed klinsmann 's coaching strategy with contempt , as he recruited many younger players into the team and was known for his unorthodox training methods .
klinsmann was also chided for his decision to commute to germany from california . but germany 's strong showing in the world cup took most observers - including germany fans - by surprise and silenced even the most relentless critics .
klinsmann subsequently became known as the " golden bomber " for his blonde hair and aggressive playing tactics . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said when it was over .
" we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . "
for that achievement , klinsmann was awarded the medal of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- by the german government . as a player , klinsmann claimed a world cup title in 1990 , when germany beat argentina 1-0 , and went on to play for france , italy and england .
after a brief stint as a striker for california 's orange county blue star , klinsmann retired in 1998 and began his career as a coach . dw staff -lrb- ab / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .

guernica .
history of a painting " explores the genesis of a unique work that is considered by many as modern art 's most powerful anti-war symbol .
" picasso created a painting that is still very moving , " said director of the berlin wall museum alexandra hildebrandt .
" it does n't show airplanes or enemies .
it 's filled with dead and injured bodies .
it could 've carried the name of ' dresden ' or ' hiroshima . " '
" thanks to picasso 's famous painting , guernica 's name has not been forgotten , which is what happened to many other places with a similar destiny , " hildebrandt said .
the berlin exhibition , which opened on wednesday , has been set up by spanish book publisher and curator jacobo armero .
bildunterschrift : picasso 's " guernica " is a testimony to the power of art a symbol of national pride for many basques " guernica " is an important symbol of their national identity as the town is considered the centre of their cultural traditions .
the town was once home to an oak tree which spanish kings would stand beneath and vow to respect an ancient code giving the independent-minded basques special rights .
the tree survived the bombing but died during a heat wave in 2003 and was replaced two years later .
after franco won the civil war and established a dictatorship , picasso arranged for the museum of modern art -lrb- moma -rrb- in new york keep the painting for as long as he was in power .
during the vietnam war , the room housing " guernica " at the us museum became the site of occasional anti-war vigils .
franco died in 1975 - two years after picasso - and in 1981 the painting arrived in newly democratic spain where it was housed first in an annex of madrid 's prado museum before being moved to the reina sofia , which is named after spain 's current queen .
around the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people died in the bombing of guernica the mural , which is 3.5 metres -lrb- 11 feet -rrb- tall and 7.8 metres wide , was exhibited in more than 50 different palces around the world between 1937 and 1957 , including brazil , germany and the united states .
the frequent moves during this time damaged the painting and it is now very fragile , the head of the museum 's conservation department , jorge garcia , told afp last year .
" it is unthinkable to wrap it up again , anyone who desires this is crazy , " he said at the time .
the 70th anniversary of the bombing has also led to renewed calls for picasso 's painting to be put on display in the town .
museum directors and the central government in madrid turned down the request , saying the painting was to fragile to be moved .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .
new age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff practically brought the berlin wall down now , there is knut - berlin 's cuddly sensation , the polar bear who was rejected by his mother , but adopted by an entire city .
unlike jfk and david hasselhoff , knut did n't want to become a berliner .
his idea of fun involves fish and freezing cold showers , not jelly doughnuts and screaming children .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .
new age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff practically brought the berlin wall down now , there is knut - berlin 's cuddly sensation , the polar bear who was rejected by his mother , but adopted by an entire city .
unlike jfk and david hasselhoff , knut did n't want to become a berliner .
his idea of fun involves fish and freezing cold showers , not jelly doughnuts and screaming children .
but he had no saying in the whole matter and he is now the most famous living berliner , an overnight celebrity , a symbol of the fight against global warming and the hairiest celebrity ever to make the cover of vanity fair .
a new website called youknut - in reference to the popular internet video sharing site youtube - has been set up as a place for kunt fans to share their stories , songs and video about their favorite berliner .

history of a painting " explores the genesis of a unique work that is considered by many as modern art 's most powerful anti-war symbol .
" picasso created a painting that is still very moving , " said director of the berlin wall museum alexandra hildebrandt .
" it does n't show airplanes or enemies .
it 's filled with dead and injured bodies .
it could 've carried the name of ' dresden ' or ' hiroshima . " '
" thanks to picasso 's famous painting , guernica 's name has not been forgotten , which is what happened to many other places with a similar destiny , " hildebrandt said .
the berlin exhibition , which opened on wednesday , has been set up by spanish book publisher and curator jacobo armero .
bildunterschrift : picasso 's " guernica " is a testimony to the power of art a symbol of national pride for many basques " guernica " is an important symbol of their national identity as the town is considered the centre of their cultural traditions .
the town was once home to an oak tree which spanish kings would stand beneath and vow to respect an ancient code giving the independent-minded basques special rights .
the tree survived the bombing but died during a heat wave in 2003 and was replaced two years later .
after franco won the civil war and established a dictatorship , picasso arranged for the museum of modern art -lrb- moma -rrb- in new york keep the painting for as long as he was in power .
during the vietnam war , the room housing " guernica " at the us museum became the site of occasional anti-war vigils .
franco died in 1975 - two years after picasso - and in 1981 the painting arrived in newly democratic spain where it was housed first in an annex of madrid 's prado museum before being moved to the reina sofia , which is named after spain 's current queen .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .
new age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff practically brought the berlin wall down now , there is knut - berlin 's cuddly sensation , the polar bear who was rejected by his mother , but adopted by an entire city .
unlike jfk and david hasselhoff , knut did n't want to become a berliner .
his idea of fun involves fish and freezing cold showers , not jelly doughnuts and screaming children .
but he had no saying in the whole matter and he is now the most famous living berliner , an overnight celebrity , a symbol of the fight against global warming and the hairiest celebrity ever to make the cover of vanity fair .
a new website called youknut - in reference to the popular internet video sharing site youtube - has been set up as a place for kunt fans to share their stories , songs and video about their favorite berliner .
one user posted a poem called " knut , oh knut , " while another used the site to announce he was looking for the nice girl he had met on the subway who wore the youknut badge .

dw 's karl zawadzky comments on what the leadership crisis means for germany 's biggest electronics company . those who thought that supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer would be the last to go in connection with the siemens corruption scandal have been proven wrong : chief executive klaus kleinfeld will give up his post , too .
and he 's unlikely to be the last sacrifice in the executive suite .
siemens managerial board members are facing federal prosecutors ; one active member spent time in police custody as did a former board member .
in an open power struggle , the supervisory board refused to extend kleinfeld 's contract .
kleinfeld had no choice but to announce his voluntary resignation .
thus , he avoided getting fired .
the fate of top professionals at this globally active company is not the issue .
the issue is siemens itself .
the way the crisis has been managed is just as scandalous as the actual events that caused it .
up to 400 million euros -lrb- $ 540 million -rrb- - a gigantic sum - were embezzled for bribes to win massive contracts in countries prone to corruption .
investigators are feverishly searching for proof of corruption , for the perpetrators and for those responsible .
so far , no one believes that long-time ceo von pierer or his successor , kleinfeld , was personally involved in the scandal or even that they were aware of the bribes .
but they are nevertheless not free of responsibility .
how could millions and millions disappear into shady channels without the boss knowing anything about it ?
if that was the case , then there was a lack of control and control mechanisms .
perhaps the company 's executives did n't look too closely , because then an otherwise prevalent practice that led so nicely to large contracts would n't have worked anymore ?
that 's just a suspicion .
but it 's enough .
on top of it all comes a scandal within a scandal : siemens violated german law by putting millions of euros into the foundation of an employer-friendly organization to represent workers which was meant to undermine the trade union .
divide and conquer was the strategy .
it 's true that without a thorough clean-up at the top , siemens wo n't be able to make a credible new start .
however , the employers ' representatives in the supervisory board behaved extremely unprofessionally , causing the company further damage .
with nearly 500,000 employees , plants , joint ventures and offices in practically every country in the world , siemens is one of the biggest global companies - and now it has no leadership .
the concern is desperately searching for a new ceo .
that provides an ideal opportunity for carpetbaggers who long ago first suggested breaking up the company and selling off its individual parts .

but in last weekend 's loss to stuttgart , munich ran out of luck - to many fans ' delight . with nineteen bundesliga titles to their name , bayern munich are used to lording it over the rest of the league .
munich haters often refer to their new stadium , the allianzarena as the " arrogance arena , " and bayern president franz beckenbauer once dismissed the uefa cup as a competition for losers . but the uefa cup - and not , as is customary , the champions league - is precisely where bayern would be if the season ended today .
five points behind third-place stuttgart , once-mighty munich will struggle to salvage anything from this season . and the prospect of seeing the bundesliga 's titan drop into the ranks of the also-rans for the first time in more than a decade has many fans rubbing their hands with glee . the tabloid bild newspaper described the team as " idiots " and " losers in lederhosen " after their desultory performance in stuttgart .
and the bz newspaper wrote : " they used to brag that they were stronger than ox .
but now they 're the ones getting gored . " throwing money at the problem could be a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger is one of many who have disappointed bayern 's bosses have already said they will revamp the squad in the off-season , and bloggers on throughout germany are relishing the prospect of seeing the bundesliga 's richest club have to break open the piggy bank . bayern 's biggest need , everyone agrees , is a creative midfielder .
neither mark van bommel , who 's more of a workhorse , nor bastian schweinsteiger , who 's more comfortable on the wing , have been able the play the role previously filled by stefan effenberg , mehmet scholl and michael ballack . but if bayern are only competing in the uefa cup next season , it 's unlikely that they can attract a top international playmaker - no matter how much they loosen the purse-strings . and the typical bayern strategy of luring away players from other bundesliga sides may not work either .
the best playmaker in the league , bremen 's diego , has already said he 's not interested in offers from munich .
schalke 's lincoln and hamburg 's raphael van der vaart have made similar statements . rebuilding or regression ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ottmar hitzfeld has n't been able top turn things around bayern will start to try and salvage the season this weekend at home to hamburg , but it 's an uphill battle .
coach ottmar hitzfeld says he hopes he will have seven or eight new players with whom he can stage a comeback next year . but even some bayern fans are questioning whether hitzfeld , who led the club in its glory years around the millennium , is up to the job . " for me he 's the wrong coach to clean up the club , " wrote one blogger .
" on the contrary , he fits perfectly with the current system . " bayern brought back hitzfeld this february to replace felix magath , but his record has been worse than his predecessor 's . and some fans blame management for poor personnel decisions .
" i do n't think the magical troika -lrb- of uli hoeneß , karl-heinz rummenigge and franz beckenbauer -rrb- know how the club should develop , " another disappointed supporter wrote .
" it never occurs to them that they might be to blame for things not going well . " when commercial manager uli hoeneß cautioned bayern fans at beginning of the 2006-7 campaign that this would be a transitional season , most supporters thought he was being over-cautious .
now they know better . " a ' transitional season , " ' one fan sighed in an internet post .
" all well and good .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi warplanes turned guernica into a landscape of pain and destruction the attack on april 26 , 1937 leveled three-quarters of the historic town , killing hundreds of the roughly 6,000 people which called it home at the time .
" in the panel on which i am working , which i shall call guernica , and in all my recent works of art , i clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk spain in an ocean of pain and death , " picasso was quoted as saying as he worked on the mural .
history of a painting today , marking the 70th anniversary of the attack by the nazi 's condor legion on the basque town , an exhibition at the wall museum in berlin entitled " pablo picasso .
guernica .
history of a painting " explores the genesis of a unique work that is considered by many as modern art 's most powerful anti-war symbol .
" picasso created a painting that is still very moving , " said director of the berlin wall museum alexandra hildebrandt .
" it does n't show airplanes or enemies .
it 's filled with dead and injured bodies .
it could 've carried the name of ' dresden ' or ' hiroshima . " '
" thanks to picasso 's famous painting , guernica 's name has not been forgotten , which is what happened to many other places with a similar destiny , " hildebrandt said .
the berlin exhibition , which opened on wednesday , has been set up by spanish book publisher and curator jacobo armero .
bildunterschrift : picasso 's " guernica " is a testimony to the power of art a symbol of national pride for many basques " guernica " is an important symbol of their national identity as the town is considered the centre of their cultural traditions .
the town was once home to an oak tree which spanish kings would stand beneath and vow to respect an ancient code giving the independent-minded basques special rights .
the tree survived the bombing but died during a heat wave in 2003 and was replaced two years later .
after franco won the civil war and established a dictatorship , picasso arranged for the museum of modern art -lrb- moma -rrb- in new york keep the painting for as long as he was in power .
during the vietnam war , the room housing " guernica " at the us museum became the site of occasional anti-war vigils .
franco died in 1975 - two years after picasso - and in 1981 the painting arrived in newly democratic spain where it was housed first in an annex of madrid 's prado museum before being moved to the reina sofia , which is named after spain 's current queen .
around the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people died in the bombing of guernica the mural , which is 3.5 metres -lrb- 11 feet -rrb- tall and 7.8 metres wide , was exhibited in more than 50 different palces around the world between 1937 and 1957 , including brazil , germany and the united states .
the frequent moves during this time damaged the painting and it is now very fragile , the head of the museum 's conservation department , jorge garcia , told afp last year .
" it is unthinkable to wrap it up again , anyone who desires this is crazy , " he said at the time .
the 70th anniversary of the bombing has also led to renewed calls for picasso 's painting to be put on display in the town .
museum directors and the central government in madrid turned down the request , saying the painting was to fragile to be moved .
basque government officials said they would now try to have the painting moved to guernica in time for the 75th anniversary of the attack . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin exhibition explores art and science of pain a new exhibition in berlin aims to explore the many facets of human pain .

german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .
here we almost look after every single colony . "
age factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honey as well as wax and royal jelly are products that come from beekeeping on the other hand , german apiary faces its own difficulties .
" beekeepers here tend to be loners , " said schricker , who has been studying bees since becoming a student of zoology in the 1960s .
" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .
politicians have n't realized the value of honey bees . "
age is also a major issue .
friedrich said federation members are , on average , 60 years old , while most of the people taking up the hobby also tend to be 40 and over .
the mobility required in today 's society makes it difficult to persuade young people to take up the hobby , she said .
" the age structure remains a problem , " friedrich said .
" the tendency is positive .
more women are joining .
up to now it has always tended to be a bit of a male domain .
but more beekeepers are dying than are taking up the hobby .
if we are to keep it alive , we need lots of new people . "
across the country , a whole variety of courses are on offer to introduce people all ages to beekeeping .
in bavaria , a leasing scheme has been launched to allow potential beekeepers to try out the pastime .
city bees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recruitment drive is on to find young beekeepers and although beekeeping has traditionally been very much a rural pastime that does not mean that city dwellers have to be excluded .
" even in berlin people keep bees , " schricker said .
" in allotments , on rooftop gardens and even on their balconies . "
a berlin bee has even been bred especially to suit urban conditions .
" it has certain characteristics such as docility and it is also attracted to blossom that you can find in the city - tree blossom mainly , " he said .
while people may not have to live in the country to become a beekeeper , a dollop of idealism helps .
the profits that can be made from selling hand-harvested honey tend to be limited .
" it 's a nice hobby , " schricker said .
" you also have to appreciate the social value too .

only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.04.2007 german beekeepers fighting for the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bee populations have been devastated - the reason why is unclear bee populations in the us have dramatically dropped over the last six months .
german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .
here we almost look after every single colony . "
age factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honey as well as wax and royal jelly are products that come from beekeeping on the other hand , german apiary faces its own difficulties .
" beekeepers here tend to be loners , " said schricker , who has been studying bees since becoming a student of zoology in the 1960s .
" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .
politicians have n't realized the value of honey bees . "
age is also a major issue .
friedrich said federation members are , on average , 60 years old , while most of the people taking up the hobby also tend to be 40 and over .
the mobility required in today 's society makes it difficult to persuade young people to take up the hobby , she said .
" the age structure remains a problem , " friedrich said .
" the tendency is positive .
more women are joining .
up to now it has always tended to be a bit of a male domain .
but more beekeepers are dying than are taking up the hobby .
if we are to keep it alive , we need lots of new people . "
across the country , a whole variety of courses are on offer to introduce people all ages to beekeeping .
in bavaria , a leasing scheme has been launched to allow potential beekeepers to try out the pastime .
city bees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recruitment drive is on to find young beekeepers and although beekeeping has traditionally been very much a rural pastime that does not mean that city dwellers have to be excluded .
" even in berlin people keep bees , " schricker said .
" in allotments , on rooftop gardens and even on their balconies . "
a berlin bee has even been bred especially to suit urban conditions .
" it has certain characteristics such as docility and it is also attracted to blossom that you can find in the city - tree blossom mainly , " he said .
while people may not have to live in the country to become a beekeeper , a dollop of idealism helps .
the profits that can be made from selling hand-harvested honey tend to be limited .
" it 's a nice hobby , " schricker said .
" you also have to appreciate the social value too .
keeping bees is a very good way to react to climate change .
here on the ground it 's a way each one of us can do something for the future .

dw 's karl zawadzky comments on what the leadership crisis means for germany 's biggest electronics company . those who thought that supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer would be the last to go in connection with the siemens corruption scandal have been proven wrong : chief executive klaus kleinfeld will give up his post , too .
and he 's unlikely to be the last sacrifice in the executive suite .
siemens managerial board members are facing federal prosecutors ; one active member spent time in police custody as did a former board member .
in an open power struggle , the supervisory board refused to extend kleinfeld 's contract .
kleinfeld had no choice but to announce his voluntary resignation .
thus , he avoided getting fired .
the fate of top professionals at this globally active company is not the issue .
the issue is siemens itself .
the way the crisis has been managed is just as scandalous as the actual events that caused it .
up to 400 million euros -lrb- $ 540 million -rrb- - a gigantic sum - were embezzled for bribes to win massive contracts in countries prone to corruption .
investigators are feverishly searching for proof of corruption , for the perpetrators and for those responsible .
so far , no one believes that long-time ceo von pierer or his successor , kleinfeld , was personally involved in the scandal or even that they were aware of the bribes .
but they are nevertheless not free of responsibility .
how could millions and millions disappear into shady channels without the boss knowing anything about it ?
if that was the case , then there was a lack of control and control mechanisms .
perhaps the company 's executives did n't look too closely , because then an otherwise prevalent practice that led so nicely to large contracts would n't have worked anymore ?
that 's just a suspicion .
but it 's enough .
on top of it all comes a scandal within a scandal : siemens violated german law by putting millions of euros into the foundation of an employer-friendly organization to represent workers which was meant to undermine the trade union .
divide and conquer was the strategy .
it 's true that without a thorough clean-up at the top , siemens wo n't be able to make a credible new start .
however , the employers ' representatives in the supervisory board behaved extremely unprofessionally , causing the company further damage .
with nearly 500,000 employees , plants , joint ventures and offices in practically every country in the world , siemens is one of the biggest global companies - and now it has no leadership .
the concern is desperately searching for a new ceo .

dw 's karl zawadzky comments on what the leadership crisis means for germany 's biggest electronics company . those who thought that supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer would be the last to go in connection with the siemens corruption scandal have been proven wrong : chief executive klaus kleinfeld will give up his post , too .
and he 's unlikely to be the last sacrifice in the executive suite .
siemens managerial board members are facing federal prosecutors ; one active member spent time in police custody as did a former board member .
in an open power struggle , the supervisory board refused to extend kleinfeld 's contract .
kleinfeld had no choice but to announce his voluntary resignation .
thus , he avoided getting fired .
the fate of top professionals at this globally active company is not the issue .
the issue is siemens itself .
the way the crisis has been managed is just as scandalous as the actual events that caused it .
up to 400 million euros -lrb- $ 540 million -rrb- - a gigantic sum - were embezzled for bribes to win massive contracts in countries prone to corruption .
investigators are feverishly searching for proof of corruption , for the perpetrators and for those responsible .
so far , no one believes that long-time ceo von pierer or his successor , kleinfeld , was personally involved in the scandal or even that they were aware of the bribes .
but they are nevertheless not free of responsibility .
how could millions and millions disappear into shady channels without the boss knowing anything about it ?
if that was the case , then there was a lack of control and control mechanisms .
perhaps the company 's executives did n't look too closely , because then an otherwise prevalent practice that led so nicely to large contracts would n't have worked anymore ?
that 's just a suspicion .
but it 's enough .
on top of it all comes a scandal within a scandal : siemens violated german law by putting millions of euros into the foundation of an employer-friendly organization to represent workers which was meant to undermine the trade union .
divide and conquer was the strategy .
it 's true that without a thorough clean-up at the top , siemens wo n't be able to make a credible new start .
however , the employers ' representatives in the supervisory board behaved extremely unprofessionally , causing the company further damage .
with nearly 500,000 employees , plants , joint ventures and offices in practically every country in the world , siemens is one of the biggest global companies - and now it has no leadership .
the concern is desperately searching for a new ceo .
that provides an ideal opportunity for carpetbaggers who long ago first suggested breaking up the company and selling off its individual parts .

members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , who were present at a meeting of the committee on wednesday , reported fritsche ’ s comments to the press .
representatives from all political parties criticized the highly controversial practice as unlawful .
germany ’ s commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , told afp news service he thinks the practice is anti-constitutional , and said the matter would be looked into immediately .
meanwhile , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called for a change in the law for online computer monitoring .
spying allowed by schily the chancellor ’ s office said that in light of terrorism threats , examining pc hard drives is an " important intelligence tool . "
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far is too far ?
government spies have been accessing private data via the internet computer-monitoring by germany ’ s interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been possible since the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it , in june , 2005 .
according to the chancellor ’ s office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
social democratic interior committee chairman , sebastian edathy , told afp that schily ’ s regulations were " not a sustainable -lrb- legal -rrb- basis . "
the number of searches undertaken were only " in the single digits , " he said , but added that the parliament needed to give a " clear sign " that there are still insufficient legal grounds for carrying out such searches .
he also said he could imagine allowing such monitoring in particularly grievous cases , but then only under oversight of the court .
schäuble : ' let 's look at article 13 ' interior minister schäuble told parliament that online data searches should not be allowed without a legal foundation .
if the searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy , " then let ’ s think about whether we want to expand article 13 , " he said .
following the german federal court ’ s decision , schäuble had lobbied hard for a legal provision to allow police to do on-line searches .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are absolutely necessary , but they need a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
the social democrats reproached them that the statements were meant to imply the spd is opposed to online searches , although " they themselves started the searches . "
opposition is outspoken bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat schily signed work decrees on spying in 2005 green party interior expert silke stokar told afp news service that the " secret working decrees " acted to bypass parliament .
" it is simply anti-constitutional , " she said .
greens party chief claudia roth said both intelligence agencies , the bfv and bnd , clearly consider " civil rights and informational self-determination from the perspective of a wrecking company . "
max stadler , interior expert from the liberal fdp party , called for the german government to terminate the searches instantly .
" lawmakers should keep their hands off of online searches , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
fdp parliamentarian gisela piltz said the budget for searches should be blocked .

now the tense calm that had reigned in their nearly 18 months in power is history .
the spat between the long-time rivals came to a head when volker kauder , the christian democrats ' parliamentary group leader and a member of merkel 's inner circle , accused social democrats of grandstanding at germany 's expense .
" the spd is damaging the country , " he told news channel n24 after leading social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- went on the attack over conservative proposals to slash corporate taxes and eliminate the inheritance tax .

but in last weekend 's loss to stuttgart , munich ran out of luck - to many fans ' delight . with nineteen bundesliga titles to their name , bayern munich are used to lording it over the rest of the league .
munich haters often refer to their new stadium , the allianzarena as the " arrogance arena , " and bayern president franz beckenbauer once dismissed the uefa cup as a competition for losers . but the uefa cup - and not , as is customary , the champions league - is precisely where bayern would be if the season ended today .
five points behind third-place stuttgart , once-mighty munich will struggle to salvage anything from this season . and the prospect of seeing the bundesliga 's titan drop into the ranks of the also-rans for the first time in more than a decade has many fans rubbing their hands with glee . the tabloid bild newspaper described the team as " idiots " and " losers in lederhosen " after their desultory performance in stuttgart .

neither mark van bommel , who 's more of a workhorse , nor bastian schweinsteiger , who 's more comfortable on the wing , have been able the play the role previously filled by stefan effenberg , mehmet scholl and michael ballack . but if bayern are only competing in the uefa cup next season , it 's unlikely that they can attract a top international playmaker - no matter how much they loosen the purse-strings . and the typical bayern strategy of luring away players from other bundesliga sides may not work either .
the best playmaker in the league , bremen 's diego , has already said he 's not interested in offers from munich .
schalke 's lincoln and hamburg 's raphael van der vaart have made similar statements . rebuilding or regression ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ottmar hitzfeld has n't been able top turn things around bayern will start to try and salvage the season this weekend at home to hamburg , but it 's an uphill battle .
coach ottmar hitzfeld says he hopes he will have seven or eight new players with whom he can stage a comeback next year . but even some bayern fans are questioning whether hitzfeld , who led the club in its glory years around the millennium , is up to the job . " for me he 's the wrong coach to clean up the club , " wrote one blogger .
" on the contrary , he fits perfectly with the current system . " bayern brought back hitzfeld this february to replace felix magath , but his record has been worse than his predecessor 's . and some fans blame management for poor personnel decisions .
" i do n't think the magical troika -lrb- of uli hoeneß , karl-heinz rummenigge and franz beckenbauer -rrb- know how the club should develop , " another disappointed supporter wrote .
" it never occurs to them that they might be to blame for things not going well . " when commercial manager uli hoeneß cautioned bayern fans at beginning of the 2006-7 campaign that this would be a transitional season , most supporters thought he was being over-cautious .
now they know better . " a ' transitional season , " ' one fan sighed in an internet post .
" all well and good .

dw 's karl zawadzky comments on what the leadership crisis means for germany 's biggest electronics company . those who thought that supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer would be the last to go in connection with the siemens corruption scandal have been proven wrong : chief executive klaus kleinfeld will give up his post , too .
and he 's unlikely to be the last sacrifice in the executive suite .
siemens managerial board members are facing federal prosecutors ; one active member spent time in police custody as did a former board member .
in an open power struggle , the supervisory board refused to extend kleinfeld 's contract .
kleinfeld had no choice but to announce his voluntary resignation .
thus , he avoided getting fired .
the fate of top professionals at this globally active company is not the issue .
the issue is siemens itself .
the way the crisis has been managed is just as scandalous as the actual events that caused it .
up to 400 million euros -lrb- $ 540 million -rrb- - a gigantic sum - were embezzled for bribes to win massive contracts in countries prone to corruption .
investigators are feverishly searching for proof of corruption , for the perpetrators and for those responsible .
so far , no one believes that long-time ceo von pierer or his successor , kleinfeld , was personally involved in the scandal or even that they were aware of the bribes .
but they are nevertheless not free of responsibility .
how could millions and millions disappear into shady channels without the boss knowing anything about it ?
if that was the case , then there was a lack of control and control mechanisms .
perhaps the company 's executives did n't look too closely , because then an otherwise prevalent practice that led so nicely to large contracts would n't have worked anymore ?
that 's just a suspicion .
but it 's enough .
on top of it all comes a scandal within a scandal : siemens violated german law by putting millions of euros into the foundation of an employer-friendly organization to represent workers which was meant to undermine the trade union .
divide and conquer was the strategy .
it 's true that without a thorough clean-up at the top , siemens wo n't be able to make a credible new start .
however , the employers ' representatives in the supervisory board behaved extremely unprofessionally , causing the company further damage .
with nearly 500,000 employees , plants , joint ventures and offices in practically every country in the world , siemens is one of the biggest global companies - and now it has no leadership .
the concern is desperately searching for a new ceo .
that provides an ideal opportunity for carpetbaggers who long ago first suggested breaking up the company and selling off its individual parts .

" read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .
what we found in many of the incidents is that the shooters were , actually , treated unjustly .
in erfurt , -lrb- the shooter robert -rrb- steinhäuser had to leave school in the 12th grade .
and he was kicked out for quite a minor infraction .
at this point , he had nothing to do ; he was totally lost .
in emsdetten , the shooter was treated unfairly by his peers .
making procedures to deal with these could be a big step toward toward prevention . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virginia shooting causes shockwaves in germany 's erfurt the shock of the virginia shooting massacre is being echoed in the eastern german city of erfurt , where there were calls for tighter gun control laws after a student shot dead 16 people at his high school five years ago .

they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .
what we found in many of the incidents is that the shooters were , actually , treated unjustly .
in erfurt , -lrb- the shooter robert -rrb- steinhäuser had to leave school in the 12th grade .
and he was kicked out for quite a minor infraction .
at this point , he had nothing to do ; he was totally lost .
in emsdetten , the shooter was treated unfairly by his peers .
making procedures to deal with these could be a big step toward toward prevention . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virginia shooting causes shockwaves in germany 's erfurt the shock of the virginia shooting massacre is being echoed in the eastern german city of erfurt , where there were calls for tighter gun control laws after a student shot dead 16 people at his high school five years ago .

" read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .

" read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .
what we found in many of the incidents is that the shooters were , actually , treated unjustly .
in erfurt , -lrb- the shooter robert -rrb- steinhäuser had to leave school in the 12th grade .
and he was kicked out for quite a minor infraction .
at this point , he had nothing to do ; he was totally lost .
in emsdetten , the shooter was treated unfairly by his peers .
making procedures to deal with these could be a big step toward toward prevention . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virginia shooting causes shockwaves in germany 's erfurt the shock of the virginia shooting massacre is being echoed in the eastern german city of erfurt , where there were calls for tighter gun control laws after a student shot dead 16 people at his high school five years ago .

dw 's karl zawadzky comments on what the leadership crisis means for germany 's biggest electronics company . those who thought that supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer would be the last to go in connection with the siemens corruption scandal have been proven wrong : chief executive klaus kleinfeld will give up his post , too .
and he 's unlikely to be the last sacrifice in the executive suite .
siemens managerial board members are facing federal prosecutors ; one active member spent time in police custody as did a former board member .
in an open power struggle , the supervisory board refused to extend kleinfeld 's contract .
kleinfeld had no choice but to announce his voluntary resignation .
thus , he avoided getting fired .
the fate of top professionals at this globally active company is not the issue .
the issue is siemens itself .
the way the crisis has been managed is just as scandalous as the actual events that caused it .
up to 400 million euros -lrb- $ 540 million -rrb- - a gigantic sum - were embezzled for bribes to win massive contracts in countries prone to corruption .
investigators are feverishly searching for proof of corruption , for the perpetrators and for those responsible .
so far , no one believes that long-time ceo von pierer or his successor , kleinfeld , was personally involved in the scandal or even that they were aware of the bribes .
but they are nevertheless not free of responsibility .
how could millions and millions disappear into shady channels without the boss knowing anything about it ?
if that was the case , then there was a lack of control and control mechanisms .
perhaps the company 's executives did n't look too closely , because then an otherwise prevalent practice that led so nicely to large contracts would n't have worked anymore ?
that 's just a suspicion .
but it 's enough .
on top of it all comes a scandal within a scandal : siemens violated german law by putting millions of euros into the foundation of an employer-friendly organization to represent workers which was meant to undermine the trade union .
divide and conquer was the strategy .
it 's true that without a thorough clean-up at the top , siemens wo n't be able to make a credible new start .
however , the employers ' representatives in the supervisory board behaved extremely unprofessionally , causing the company further damage .
with nearly 500,000 employees , plants , joint ventures and offices in practically every country in the world , siemens is one of the biggest global companies - and now it has no leadership .
the concern is desperately searching for a new ceo .
that provides an ideal opportunity for carpetbaggers who long ago first suggested breaking up the company and selling off its individual parts .

it 's filled with dead and injured bodies .
it could 've carried the name of ' dresden ' or ' hiroshima . " '

after franco won the civil war and established a dictatorship , picasso arranged for the museum of modern art -lrb- moma -rrb- in new york keep the painting for as long as he was in power .

members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , who were present at a meeting of the committee on wednesday , reported fritsche ’ s comments to the press .
representatives from all political parties criticized the highly controversial practice as unlawful .

government spies have been accessing private data via the internet computer-monitoring by germany ’ s interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been possible since the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it , in june , 2005 .
according to the chancellor ’ s office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
social democratic interior committee chairman , sebastian edathy , told afp that schily ’ s regulations were " not a sustainable -lrb- legal -rrb- basis . "
the number of searches undertaken were only " in the single digits , " he said , but added that the parliament needed to give a " clear sign " that there are still insufficient legal grounds for carrying out such searches .
he also said he could imagine allowing such monitoring in particularly grievous cases , but then only under oversight of the court .
schäuble : ' let 's look at article 13 ' interior minister schäuble told parliament that online data searches should not be allowed without a legal foundation .
if the searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy , " then let ’ s think about whether we want to expand article 13 , " he said .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .
new age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff practically brought the berlin wall down now , there is knut - berlin 's cuddly sensation , the polar bear who was rejected by his mother , but adopted by an entire city .
unlike jfk and david hasselhoff , knut did n't want to become a berliner .
his idea of fun involves fish and freezing cold showers , not jelly doughnuts and screaming children .
but he had no saying in the whole matter and he is now the most famous living berliner , an overnight celebrity , a symbol of the fight against global warming and the hairiest celebrity ever to make the cover of vanity fair .
a new website called youknut - in reference to the popular internet video sharing site youtube - has been set up as a place for kunt fans to share their stories , songs and video about their favorite berliner .
one user posted a poem called " knut , oh knut , " while another used the site to announce he was looking for the nice girl he had met on the subway who wore the youknut badge .
and the cynics thought that there was no place for poetry or love in today 's world ?
the dark side of fame real celebrities always polarize .
think paris hilton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , knut , what a guy !
another german website , ominously called kill-knut.com , is built on the knowledge that the public almost always has a love-hate relationship with objects of their desire .
it invites its visitors to play online games involving their puffy white hero .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .
new age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff practically brought the berlin wall down now , there is knut - berlin 's cuddly sensation , the polar bear who was rejected by his mother , but adopted by an entire city .
unlike jfk and david hasselhoff , knut did n't want to become a berliner .
his idea of fun involves fish and freezing cold showers , not jelly doughnuts and screaming children .
but he had no saying in the whole matter and he is now the most famous living berliner , an overnight celebrity , a symbol of the fight against global warming and the hairiest celebrity ever to make the cover of vanity fair .
a new website called youknut - in reference to the popular internet video sharing site youtube - has been set up as a place for kunt fans to share their stories , songs and video about their favorite berliner .
one user posted a poem called " knut , oh knut , " while another used the site to announce he was looking for the nice girl he had met on the subway who wore the youknut badge .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .
new age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff practically brought the berlin wall down now , there is knut - berlin 's cuddly sensation , the polar bear who was rejected by his mother , but adopted by an entire city .
unlike jfk and david hasselhoff , knut did n't want to become a berliner .
his idea of fun involves fish and freezing cold showers , not jelly doughnuts and screaming children .
but he had no saying in the whole matter and he is now the most famous living berliner , an overnight celebrity , a symbol of the fight against global warming and the hairiest celebrity ever to make the cover of vanity fair .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "
an unprecedented deployment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants the osce to get involved putin said the missile defense plan , if carried out , would mark an unprecedented deployment in europe of us strategic weaponry and said this was an issue that should be of concern not just in us-russian bilateral relations but on the continent as a whole .
" in one way or another , this affects the interests of all european states including those that are not members of nato , " putin said .
the russian leader said the matter should be taken up by the vienna-based organization for security and cooperation -lrb- osce -rrb- , a body that moscow has for years accused of veering from its original mission to deal with security matters in europe toward promotion of a us political agenda .
" it is time to give the activities of the osce some real content , to turn the face of the organization toward the problems that really concern the people of europe instead of only looking to build -lrb- political -rrb- blocs in the post-soviet space , " putin said . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense secretary winds up missile shield push in germany the united states will continue to consult with its allies and russia on washington 's plans to install a missile shield in europe , us defense secretary robert gates said in berlin .

" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "

" in one way or another , this affects the interests of all european states including those that are not members of nato , " putin said .
the russian leader said the matter should be taken up by the vienna-based organization for security and cooperation -lrb- osce -rrb- , a body that moscow has for years accused of veering from its original mission to deal with security matters in europe toward promotion of a us political agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.04.2007 german beekeepers fighting for the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bee populations have been devastated - the reason why is unclear bee populations in the us have dramatically dropped over the last six months .
german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .

this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .
here we almost look after every single colony . "
age factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honey as well as wax and royal jelly are products that come from beekeeping on the other hand , german apiary faces its own difficulties .
" beekeepers here tend to be loners , " said schricker , who has been studying bees since becoming a student of zoology in the 1960s .
" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .
politicians have n't realized the value of honey bees . "
age is also a major issue .
friedrich said federation members are , on average , 60 years old , while most of the people taking up the hobby also tend to be 40 and over .
the mobility required in today 's society makes it difficult to persuade young people to take up the hobby , she said .
" the age structure remains a problem , " friedrich said .
" the tendency is positive .
more women are joining .
up to now it has always tended to be a bit of a male domain .
but more beekeepers are dying than are taking up the hobby .
if we are to keep it alive , we need lots of new people . "
across the country , a whole variety of courses are on offer to introduce people all ages to beekeeping .
in bavaria , a leasing scheme has been launched to allow potential beekeepers to try out the pastime .
city bees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recruitment drive is on to find young beekeepers and although beekeeping has traditionally been very much a rural pastime that does not mean that city dwellers have to be excluded .
" even in berlin people keep bees , " schricker said .
" in allotments , on rooftop gardens and even on their balconies . "
a berlin bee has even been bred especially to suit urban conditions .
" it has certain characteristics such as docility and it is also attracted to blossom that you can find in the city - tree blossom mainly , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "
an unprecedented deployment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants the osce to get involved putin said the missile defense plan , if carried out , would mark an unprecedented deployment in europe of us strategic weaponry and said this was an issue that should be of concern not just in us-russian bilateral relations but on the continent as a whole .
" in one way or another , this affects the interests of all european states including those that are not members of nato , " putin said .
the russian leader said the matter should be taken up by the vienna-based organization for security and cooperation -lrb- osce -rrb- , a body that moscow has for years accused of veering from its original mission to deal with security matters in europe toward promotion of a us political agenda .
" it is time to give the activities of the osce some real content , to turn the face of the organization toward the problems that really concern the people of europe instead of only looking to build -lrb- political -rrb- blocs in the post-soviet space , " putin said . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense secretary winds up missile shield push in germany the united states will continue to consult with its allies and russia on washington 's plans to install a missile shield in europe , us defense secretary robert gates said in berlin .

how about monty python 's " always look on the bright side of life , " for an unfailing morale boost ?
creedence clearwater revival 's " bad moon rising " for a touch of celestial rockabilly ?
or the rolling stones ' " 2,000 light years from home " for occasional consolation that someone else has felt as alienated as you ?

understandably , there is even more media attention being paid to the osasuna-sevilla semi than to the espanyol-bremen tie .

understandably , there is even more media attention being paid to the osasuna-sevilla semi than to the espanyol-bremen tie .
but that 's just fine for werder 's opponents who are focused purely on getting a result at home and preventing the free-scoring germans from getting a vital away goal .

we will do out utmost to claim both titles , in the league and in the uefa cup , " said diego .

jose maria del nido , the ambitious president of sevilla , pointed out on monday , that his priority is to qualify for the champions league rather than retain the uefa cup or win the spanish king 's cup .
" the champions league is a strategic , sporting and economic objective which will permit us to increase our budget by about 30 per cent , " he claimed .

now the tense calm that had reigned in their nearly 18 months in power is history .
the spat between the long-time rivals came to a head when volker kauder , the christian democrats ' parliamentary group leader and a member of merkel 's inner circle , accused social democrats of grandstanding at germany 's expense .
" the spd is damaging the country , " he told news channel n24 after leading social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- went on the attack over conservative proposals to slash corporate taxes and eliminate the inheritance tax .
a member of the spd 's board , andreas nahles , shot back on rbb radio that it was " unbelievable " that the christian democrats would call for the tax cuts in direct violation of the government 's original coalition agreement .
merkel enjoys limelight during its tenure , the " grand coalition " - the product of an inconclusive national election - merkel has deftly set the agenda and quashed dissent , sending her approval ratings soaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been feted in europe and elsewhere at the same time , the german economy - europe 's largest - has made a robust recovery , joblessness is falling and the public deficit is shrinking .
merkel has also basked in the limelight of the dual presidencies of the european union and the group of eight club of wealthy nations that she assumed in january .
off their game at the same time , the social democrats have struggled to seize on issues that resonate with their rank-and-file members and appeal to centrist voters .
the party has plummeted to just 27 percent backing in opinion polls versus 34 percent for merkel 's conservatives .
" the spd is now futilely trying to boost its profile on any number of issues , " laurenz meyer of the cdu 's parliamentary group gloated in an interview with the daily leipziger volkszeitung .
" the poll numbers are apparently taking their toll . "
the conservatives have used their advantage to go on the offensive on a range of issues , often catching the social democrats off guard .
guenther beckstein , the powerful conservative state interior minister in bavaria , infuriated social democrats when he said they would share the blame for a future terrorist attack in germany for opposing cdu plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen seems to have taken some pages from the spd 's book the parties have also reached an impasse on the spd 's call for a minimum wage in certain sectors .
the cdu argues it would be a job-killer .
and the conservative family affairs minister ursula von der leyen , a media-savvy mother of seven , has upstaged the social democrats with ambitious plans for expanding state-funded child care and family leave .
political paralysis " the spd is slowly realizing that the cdu / csu will not grant it any more major successes , " said the berlin daily tagesspiegel .
vice chancellor franz müntefering of the social democrats told public broadcaster zdf he was nevertheless confident the coalition would see out its four-year term , to 2009 .
" but we have to do better than we have done in recent weeks .
that 's for sure , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering recognizes that his party is losing the game as the social democrats cope with sinking poll ratings and the right-wing christian union parties dream of a future coalition with a smaller , less troublesome king-maker party , the result has been political paralysis in berlin .
" the cdu / csu and the spd are united by just one thought : when might be the right time to leave the coalition , citing a reason that could be made plausible ? " the center-left daily süddeutsche zeitung said .
" the hamburg -lrb- city-state -rrb- elections in february 2008 , just after a series of other state elections , are at the center of these considerations . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi warplanes turned guernica into a landscape of pain and destruction the attack on april 26 , 1937 leveled three-quarters of the historic town , killing hundreds of the roughly 6,000 people which called it home at the time .

history of a painting today , marking the 70th anniversary of the attack by the nazi 's condor legion on the basque town , an exhibition at the wall museum in berlin entitled " pablo picasso .
guernica .
history of a painting " explores the genesis of a unique work that is considered by many as modern art 's most powerful anti-war symbol .
" picasso created a painting that is still very moving , " said director of the berlin wall museum alexandra hildebrandt .
" it does n't show airplanes or enemies .
it 's filled with dead and injured bodies .
it could 've carried the name of ' dresden ' or ' hiroshima . " '
" thanks to picasso 's famous painting , guernica 's name has not been forgotten , which is what happened to many other places with a similar destiny , " hildebrandt said .
the berlin exhibition , which opened on wednesday , has been set up by spanish book publisher and curator jacobo armero .
bildunterschrift : picasso 's " guernica " is a testimony to the power of art a symbol of national pride for many basques " guernica " is an important symbol of their national identity as the town is considered the centre of their cultural traditions .
the town was once home to an oak tree which spanish kings would stand beneath and vow to respect an ancient code giving the independent-minded basques special rights .
the tree survived the bombing but died during a heat wave in 2003 and was replaced two years later .
after franco won the civil war and established a dictatorship , picasso arranged for the museum of modern art -lrb- moma -rrb- in new york keep the painting for as long as he was in power .
during the vietnam war , the room housing " guernica " at the us museum became the site of occasional anti-war vigils .
franco died in 1975 - two years after picasso - and in 1981 the painting arrived in newly democratic spain where it was housed first in an annex of madrid 's prado museum before being moved to the reina sofia , which is named after spain 's current queen .
around the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people died in the bombing of guernica the mural , which is 3.5 metres -lrb- 11 feet -rrb- tall and 7.8 metres wide , was exhibited in more than 50 different palces around the world between 1937 and 1957 , including brazil , germany and the united states .
the frequent moves during this time damaged the painting and it is now very fragile , the head of the museum 's conservation department , jorge garcia , told afp last year .
" it is unthinkable to wrap it up again , anyone who desires this is crazy , " he said at the time .
the 70th anniversary of the bombing has also led to renewed calls for picasso 's painting to be put on display in the town .
museum directors and the central government in madrid turned down the request , saying the painting was to fragile to be moved .

now , he is going into television . former germany boss jürgen klinsmann revealed on thursday he is set to return to coaching and will be spending the summer considering job offers - from both clubs and countries . despite german press reports on thursday stating klinsmann had effectively ruled himself out of coaching english premiership champions chelsea by taking a job with german tv , the 42-year old insists he wants to coach again . klinsmann will work as an analyst and commentator for pay-tv channel arena for the next two years and will fly to germany from his home in california for major bundesliga games . the arena network has confirmed that klinsmann will get his own show on a two-year contract starting next season .
the show will feature commentary and analysis around bundesliga matches and important games in foreign leagues . " i do n't see myself as the classic tv expert , " said klinsmann , " but rather as an observer who enjoys football as much as the fans do . " competing for the star coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi was no stranger to tv during his tenure as coach but the ex-german striker insists he is also ready to coach again after taking a break having led germany to third-place at last year 's world cup on home soil . " whatever happens , i want to get back into the coaching game .
we 'll have to see whether that happens sooner or later , " klinsmann said at a press conference organised by arena . he said he has told his new employers he may be taking up a coaching role in the future after receiving offers " from teams and from national federations . " " i made sure arena are aware of that , so if i accepted a coaching post , our collaboration can be suspended at any time , " specified klinsmann .
" there are a certain number of proposals from clubs and national federations on the table , i am going to wait until this summer to analyse and sort out the offers to make a decision . " klinsmann would not specify which jobs he is considering , but he has been tipped to succeed jose mourinho at chelsea . tired , emotional and burnt out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching took a lot out of klinsi - but he will be back and the former tottenham , inter milan and bayern munich forward explained why he stood down as german coach , saying he was " burned out " after two years in charge and needed to " recharge his batteries " . " it was necessary that i took a break after the world cup , it was difficult for my family .
during the last 10 months , i have enjoyed a normal family life and i also took time to assess the world cup . " klinsmann had also been in talks with the united states soccer federation last year over its bid to replace incumbent us coach bruce arena with the california-based german soccer hero .
but in december , klinsmann gave up on the idea when it became clear that he would have no control over team matters .
bob bradley is now the interim boss of the us-team as it searches for a permanent replacement . earlier this year , klinsmann had also been informally approached by the australian team , according to australian media reports .
klinsmann was reported to have discussed real estate but also football business with peter lowy , the son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy . although the tv contract has put his career as a football coach on hold for at least two years , the charismatic klinsi recently dropped a hint that he might be back for the world cup 2010 .
" who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said at a fifa conference in berlin . from underdog to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with a german national hero klinsmann became a national hero when he led the german team to third place in last year 's world cup .

he added that " after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " his new job as a television commentator is bound to afford the legendary klinsmann a more comfortable daily routine . in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , klinsmann endured scathing criticism from the tabloid press and some of his colleagues in the business .
critics viewed klinsmann 's coaching strategy with contempt , as he recruited many younger players into the team and was known for his unorthodox training methods .
klinsmann was also chided for his decision to commute to germany from california . but germany 's strong showing in the world cup took most observers - including germany fans - by surprise and silenced even the most relentless critics .
klinsmann subsequently became known as the " golden bomber " for his blonde hair and aggressive playing tactics . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said when it was over .
" we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . "
for that achievement , klinsmann was awarded the medal of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- by the german government . as a player , klinsmann claimed a world cup title in 1990 , when germany beat argentina 1-0 , and went on to play for france , italy and england .

now , he is going into television . former germany boss jürgen klinsmann revealed on thursday he is set to return to coaching and will be spending the summer considering job offers - from both clubs and countries . despite german press reports on thursday stating klinsmann had effectively ruled himself out of coaching english premiership champions chelsea by taking a job with german tv , the 42-year old insists he wants to coach again . klinsmann will work as an analyst and commentator for pay-tv channel arena for the next two years and will fly to germany from his home in california for major bundesliga games . the arena network has confirmed that klinsmann will get his own show on a two-year contract starting next season .
the show will feature commentary and analysis around bundesliga matches and important games in foreign leagues . " i do n't see myself as the classic tv expert , " said klinsmann , " but rather as an observer who enjoys football as much as the fans do . " competing for the star coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi was no stranger to tv during his tenure as coach but the ex-german striker insists he is also ready to coach again after taking a break having led germany to third-place at last year 's world cup on home soil . " whatever happens , i want to get back into the coaching game .
we 'll have to see whether that happens sooner or later , " klinsmann said at a press conference organised by arena . he said he has told his new employers he may be taking up a coaching role in the future after receiving offers " from teams and from national federations . " " i made sure arena are aware of that , so if i accepted a coaching post , our collaboration can be suspended at any time , " specified klinsmann .
" there are a certain number of proposals from clubs and national federations on the table , i am going to wait until this summer to analyse and sort out the offers to make a decision . " klinsmann would not specify which jobs he is considering , but he has been tipped to succeed jose mourinho at chelsea . tired , emotional and burnt out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching took a lot out of klinsi - but he will be back and the former tottenham , inter milan and bayern munich forward explained why he stood down as german coach , saying he was " burned out " after two years in charge and needed to " recharge his batteries " . " it was necessary that i took a break after the world cup , it was difficult for my family .
during the last 10 months , i have enjoyed a normal family life and i also took time to assess the world cup . " klinsmann had also been in talks with the united states soccer federation last year over its bid to replace incumbent us coach bruce arena with the california-based german soccer hero .
but in december , klinsmann gave up on the idea when it became clear that he would have no control over team matters .
bob bradley is now the interim boss of the us-team as it searches for a permanent replacement . earlier this year , klinsmann had also been informally approached by the australian team , according to australian media reports .
klinsmann was reported to have discussed real estate but also football business with peter lowy , the son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy . although the tv contract has put his career as a football coach on hold for at least two years , the charismatic klinsi recently dropped a hint that he might be back for the world cup 2010 .
" who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said at a fifa conference in berlin . from underdog to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with a german national hero klinsmann became a national hero when he led the german team to third place in last year 's world cup .
but he stepped down as germany head coach four days after the tournament , saying it was time to move on . klinsmann , who lives with his wife and two children in california , said then that his " big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them . "
he added that " after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " his new job as a television commentator is bound to afford the legendary klinsmann a more comfortable daily routine . in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , klinsmann endured scathing criticism from the tabloid press and some of his colleagues in the business .
critics viewed klinsmann 's coaching strategy with contempt , as he recruited many younger players into the team and was known for his unorthodox training methods .
klinsmann was also chided for his decision to commute to germany from california . but germany 's strong showing in the world cup took most observers - including germany fans - by surprise and silenced even the most relentless critics .
klinsmann subsequently became known as the " golden bomber " for his blonde hair and aggressive playing tactics . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said when it was over .
" we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . "
for that achievement , klinsmann was awarded the medal of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- by the german government . as a player , klinsmann claimed a world cup title in 1990 , when germany beat argentina 1-0 , and went on to play for france , italy and england .

during the last 10 months , i have enjoyed a normal family life and i also took time to assess the world cup . " klinsmann had also been in talks with the united states soccer federation last year over its bid to replace incumbent us coach bruce arena with the california-based german soccer hero .
but in december , klinsmann gave up on the idea when it became clear that he would have no control over team matters .
bob bradley is now the interim boss of the us-team as it searches for a permanent replacement . earlier this year , klinsmann had also been informally approached by the australian team , according to australian media reports .
klinsmann was reported to have discussed real estate but also football business with peter lowy , the son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy . although the tv contract has put his career as a football coach on hold for at least two years , the charismatic klinsi recently dropped a hint that he might be back for the world cup 2010 .
" who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said at a fifa conference in berlin . from underdog to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with a german national hero klinsmann became a national hero when he led the german team to third place in last year 's world cup .
but he stepped down as germany head coach four days after the tournament , saying it was time to move on . klinsmann , who lives with his wife and two children in california , said then that his " big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them . "
he added that " after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " his new job as a television commentator is bound to afford the legendary klinsmann a more comfortable daily routine . in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , klinsmann endured scathing criticism from the tabloid press and some of his colleagues in the business .
critics viewed klinsmann 's coaching strategy with contempt , as he recruited many younger players into the team and was known for his unorthodox training methods .
klinsmann was also chided for his decision to commute to germany from california . but germany 's strong showing in the world cup took most observers - including germany fans - by surprise and silenced even the most relentless critics .
klinsmann subsequently became known as the " golden bomber " for his blonde hair and aggressive playing tactics . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said when it was over .
" we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . "
for that achievement , klinsmann was awarded the medal of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- by the german government . as a player , klinsmann claimed a world cup title in 1990 , when germany beat argentina 1-0 , and went on to play for france , italy and england .
after a brief stint as a striker for california 's orange county blue star , klinsmann retired in 1998 and began his career as a coach . dw staff -lrb- ab / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .

members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , who were present at a meeting of the committee on wednesday , reported fritsche ’ s comments to the press .
representatives from all political parties criticized the highly controversial practice as unlawful .
germany ’ s commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , told afp news service he thinks the practice is anti-constitutional , and said the matter would be looked into immediately .
meanwhile , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called for a change in the law for online computer monitoring .
spying allowed by schily the chancellor ’ s office said that in light of terrorism threats , examining pc hard drives is an " important intelligence tool . "
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far is too far ?
government spies have been accessing private data via the internet computer-monitoring by germany ’ s interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been possible since the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it , in june , 2005 .
according to the chancellor ’ s office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
social democratic interior committee chairman , sebastian edathy , told afp that schily ’ s regulations were " not a sustainable -lrb- legal -rrb- basis . "
the number of searches undertaken were only " in the single digits , " he said , but added that the parliament needed to give a " clear sign " that there are still insufficient legal grounds for carrying out such searches .
he also said he could imagine allowing such monitoring in particularly grievous cases , but then only under oversight of the court .
schäuble : ' let 's look at article 13 ' interior minister schäuble told parliament that online data searches should not be allowed without a legal foundation .
if the searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy , " then let ’ s think about whether we want to expand article 13 , " he said .
following the german federal court ’ s decision , schäuble had lobbied hard for a legal provision to allow police to do on-line searches .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are absolutely necessary , but they need a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
the social democrats reproached them that the statements were meant to imply the spd is opposed to online searches , although " they themselves started the searches . "
opposition is outspoken bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat schily signed work decrees on spying in 2005 green party interior expert silke stokar told afp news service that the " secret working decrees " acted to bypass parliament .
" it is simply anti-constitutional , " she said .
greens party chief claudia roth said both intelligence agencies , the bfv and bnd , clearly consider " civil rights and informational self-determination from the perspective of a wrecking company . "
max stadler , interior expert from the liberal fdp party , called for the german government to terminate the searches instantly .
" lawmakers should keep their hands off of online searches , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "
an unprecedented deployment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants the osce to get involved putin said the missile defense plan , if carried out , would mark an unprecedented deployment in europe of us strategic weaponry and said this was an issue that should be of concern not just in us-russian bilateral relations but on the continent as a whole .
" in one way or another , this affects the interests of all european states including those that are not members of nato , " putin said .
the russian leader said the matter should be taken up by the vienna-based organization for security and cooperation -lrb- osce -rrb- , a body that moscow has for years accused of veering from its original mission to deal with security matters in europe toward promotion of a us political agenda .
" it is time to give the activities of the osce some real content , to turn the face of the organization toward the problems that really concern the people of europe instead of only looking to build -lrb- political -rrb- blocs in the post-soviet space , " putin said . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense secretary winds up missile shield push in germany the united states will continue to consult with its allies and russia on washington 's plans to install a missile shield in europe , us defense secretary robert gates said in berlin .

german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .
here we almost look after every single colony . "
age factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honey as well as wax and royal jelly are products that come from beekeeping on the other hand , german apiary faces its own difficulties .
" beekeepers here tend to be loners , " said schricker , who has been studying bees since becoming a student of zoology in the 1960s .
" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .
politicians have n't realized the value of honey bees . "
age is also a major issue .
friedrich said federation members are , on average , 60 years old , while most of the people taking up the hobby also tend to be 40 and over .
the mobility required in today 's society makes it difficult to persuade young people to take up the hobby , she said .
" the age structure remains a problem , " friedrich said .
" the tendency is positive .
more women are joining .
up to now it has always tended to be a bit of a male domain .
but more beekeepers are dying than are taking up the hobby .
if we are to keep it alive , we need lots of new people . "
across the country , a whole variety of courses are on offer to introduce people all ages to beekeeping .
in bavaria , a leasing scheme has been launched to allow potential beekeepers to try out the pastime .
city bees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recruitment drive is on to find young beekeepers and although beekeeping has traditionally been very much a rural pastime that does not mean that city dwellers have to be excluded .
" even in berlin people keep bees , " schricker said .
" in allotments , on rooftop gardens and even on their balconies . "
a berlin bee has even been bred especially to suit urban conditions .
" it has certain characteristics such as docility and it is also attracted to blossom that you can find in the city - tree blossom mainly , " he said .
while people may not have to live in the country to become a beekeeper , a dollop of idealism helps .
the profits that can be made from selling hand-harvested honey tend to be limited .
" it 's a nice hobby , " schricker said .
" you also have to appreciate the social value too .
keeping bees is a very good way to react to climate change .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .

but he had no saying in the whole matter and he is now the most famous living berliner , an overnight celebrity , a symbol of the fight against global warming and the hairiest celebrity ever to make the cover of vanity fair .
a new website called youknut - in reference to the popular internet video sharing site youtube - has been set up as a place for kunt fans to share their stories , songs and video about their favorite berliner .
one user posted a poem called " knut , oh knut , " while another used the site to announce he was looking for the nice girl he had met on the subway who wore the youknut badge .

another german website , ominously called kill-knut.com , is built on the knowledge that the public almost always has a love-hate relationship with objects of their desire .
it invites its visitors to play online games involving their puffy white hero .
one is called " kill knut , " the other - " feed knut . "
the choice is yours .
if you are a hormonally imbalanced teenager or a disturbed person with unresolved aggression issues , you will try to shoot as many polar bears as possible .
if , on the other hand , you are an environmentally-conscious softie who eats organic food , wears sandals and hugs trees as a matter of principle , you can earn your game points by throwing fish at hyperactive polar bears .
for each polar bear shot or fed , you get one point .
the game statistics shows that cyber-killers seem more determined than cyber-feeders .
on april 26 , the reigning top " polar bear killer " had earned 39,400 points , whereas his " feeder " counterpart had collected only 30,000 .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .
new age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff practically brought the berlin wall down now , there is knut - berlin 's cuddly sensation , the polar bear who was rejected by his mother , but adopted by an entire city .
unlike jfk and david hasselhoff , knut did n't want to become a berliner .
his idea of fun involves fish and freezing cold showers , not jelly doughnuts and screaming children .
but he had no saying in the whole matter and he is now the most famous living berliner , an overnight celebrity , a symbol of the fight against global warming and the hairiest celebrity ever to make the cover of vanity fair .
a new website called youknut - in reference to the popular internet video sharing site youtube - has been set up as a place for kunt fans to share their stories , songs and video about their favorite berliner .
one user posted a poem called " knut , oh knut , " while another used the site to announce he was looking for the nice girl he had met on the subway who wore the youknut badge .
and the cynics thought that there was no place for poetry or love in today 's world ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.04.2007 german beekeepers fighting for the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bee populations have been devastated - the reason why is unclear bee populations in the us have dramatically dropped over the last six months .
german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .
here we almost look after every single colony . "
age factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honey as well as wax and royal jelly are products that come from beekeeping on the other hand , german apiary faces its own difficulties .
" beekeepers here tend to be loners , " said schricker , who has been studying bees since becoming a student of zoology in the 1960s .
" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .
politicians have n't realized the value of honey bees . "
age is also a major issue .
friedrich said federation members are , on average , 60 years old , while most of the people taking up the hobby also tend to be 40 and over .
the mobility required in today 's society makes it difficult to persuade young people to take up the hobby , she said .
" the age structure remains a problem , " friedrich said .
" the tendency is positive .
more women are joining .
up to now it has always tended to be a bit of a male domain .
but more beekeepers are dying than are taking up the hobby .
if we are to keep it alive , we need lots of new people . "
across the country , a whole variety of courses are on offer to introduce people all ages to beekeeping .
in bavaria , a leasing scheme has been launched to allow potential beekeepers to try out the pastime .
city bees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recruitment drive is on to find young beekeepers and although beekeeping has traditionally been very much a rural pastime that does not mean that city dwellers have to be excluded .
" even in berlin people keep bees , " schricker said .
" in allotments , on rooftop gardens and even on their balconies . "
a berlin bee has even been bred especially to suit urban conditions .
" it has certain characteristics such as docility and it is also attracted to blossom that you can find in the city - tree blossom mainly , " he said .
while people may not have to live in the country to become a beekeeper , a dollop of idealism helps .
the profits that can be made from selling hand-harvested honey tend to be limited .
" it 's a nice hobby , " schricker said .
" you also have to appreciate the social value too .
keeping bees is a very good way to react to climate change .
here on the ground it 's a way each one of us can do something for the future .

now the tense calm that had reigned in their nearly 18 months in power is history .
the spat between the long-time rivals came to a head when volker kauder , the christian democrats ' parliamentary group leader and a member of merkel 's inner circle , accused social democrats of grandstanding at germany 's expense .
" the spd is damaging the country , " he told news channel n24 after leading social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- went on the attack over conservative proposals to slash corporate taxes and eliminate the inheritance tax .
a member of the spd 's board , andreas nahles , shot back on rbb radio that it was " unbelievable " that the christian democrats would call for the tax cuts in direct violation of the government 's original coalition agreement .
merkel enjoys limelight during its tenure , the " grand coalition " - the product of an inconclusive national election - merkel has deftly set the agenda and quashed dissent , sending her approval ratings soaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been feted in europe and elsewhere at the same time , the german economy - europe 's largest - has made a robust recovery , joblessness is falling and the public deficit is shrinking .
merkel has also basked in the limelight of the dual presidencies of the european union and the group of eight club of wealthy nations that she assumed in january .
off their game at the same time , the social democrats have struggled to seize on issues that resonate with their rank-and-file members and appeal to centrist voters .
the party has plummeted to just 27 percent backing in opinion polls versus 34 percent for merkel 's conservatives .
" the spd is now futilely trying to boost its profile on any number of issues , " laurenz meyer of the cdu 's parliamentary group gloated in an interview with the daily leipziger volkszeitung .
" the poll numbers are apparently taking their toll . "
the conservatives have used their advantage to go on the offensive on a range of issues , often catching the social democrats off guard .
guenther beckstein , the powerful conservative state interior minister in bavaria , infuriated social democrats when he said they would share the blame for a future terrorist attack in germany for opposing cdu plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen seems to have taken some pages from the spd 's book the parties have also reached an impasse on the spd 's call for a minimum wage in certain sectors .
the cdu argues it would be a job-killer .
and the conservative family affairs minister ursula von der leyen , a media-savvy mother of seven , has upstaged the social democrats with ambitious plans for expanding state-funded child care and family leave .
political paralysis " the spd is slowly realizing that the cdu / csu will not grant it any more major successes , " said the berlin daily tagesspiegel .
vice chancellor franz müntefering of the social democrats told public broadcaster zdf he was nevertheless confident the coalition would see out its four-year term , to 2009 .
" but we have to do better than we have done in recent weeks .
that 's for sure , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering recognizes that his party is losing the game as the social democrats cope with sinking poll ratings and the right-wing christian union parties dream of a future coalition with a smaller , less troublesome king-maker party , the result has been political paralysis in berlin .
" the cdu / csu and the spd are united by just one thought : when might be the right time to leave the coalition , citing a reason that could be made plausible ? " the center-left daily süddeutsche zeitung said .
" the hamburg -lrb- city-state -rrb- elections in february 2008 , just after a series of other state elections , are at the center of these considerations . "
despite the friction , few observers thought the government would fall .
" the coalition will not collapse now , but the aversion is growing , " the left-leaning daily frankfurter rundschau wrote . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top german politicians argue over measures to fight terrorism german politicians are at odds over a minister 's remark that the presumption of innocence does n't apply to suspected terrorists , as the cabinet on wednesday decided on new measures in the fight against terror .

now the tense calm that had reigned in their nearly 18 months in power is history .
the spat between the long-time rivals came to a head when volker kauder , the christian democrats ' parliamentary group leader and a member of merkel 's inner circle , accused social democrats of grandstanding at germany 's expense .
" the spd is damaging the country , " he told news channel n24 after leading social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- went on the attack over conservative proposals to slash corporate taxes and eliminate the inheritance tax .
a member of the spd 's board , andreas nahles , shot back on rbb radio that it was " unbelievable " that the christian democrats would call for the tax cuts in direct violation of the government 's original coalition agreement .
merkel enjoys limelight during its tenure , the " grand coalition " - the product of an inconclusive national election - merkel has deftly set the agenda and quashed dissent , sending her approval ratings soaring .

off their game at the same time , the social democrats have struggled to seize on issues that resonate with their rank-and-file members and appeal to centrist voters .
the party has plummeted to just 27 percent backing in opinion polls versus 34 percent for merkel 's conservatives .
" the spd is now futilely trying to boost its profile on any number of issues , " laurenz meyer of the cdu 's parliamentary group gloated in an interview with the daily leipziger volkszeitung .
" the poll numbers are apparently taking their toll . "
the conservatives have used their advantage to go on the offensive on a range of issues , often catching the social democrats off guard .
guenther beckstein , the powerful conservative state interior minister in bavaria , infuriated social democrats when he said they would share the blame for a future terrorist attack in germany for opposing cdu plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen seems to have taken some pages from the spd 's book the parties have also reached an impasse on the spd 's call for a minimum wage in certain sectors .

political paralysis " the spd is slowly realizing that the cdu / csu will not grant it any more major successes , " said the berlin daily tagesspiegel .

members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , who were present at a meeting of the committee on wednesday , reported fritsche ’ s comments to the press .
representatives from all political parties criticized the highly controversial practice as unlawful .
germany ’ s commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , told afp news service he thinks the practice is anti-constitutional , and said the matter would be looked into immediately .
meanwhile , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called for a change in the law for online computer monitoring .
spying allowed by schily the chancellor ’ s office said that in light of terrorism threats , examining pc hard drives is an " important intelligence tool . "
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far is too far ?
government spies have been accessing private data via the internet computer-monitoring by germany ’ s interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been possible since the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it , in june , 2005 .
according to the chancellor ’ s office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
social democratic interior committee chairman , sebastian edathy , told afp that schily ’ s regulations were " not a sustainable -lrb- legal -rrb- basis . "
the number of searches undertaken were only " in the single digits , " he said , but added that the parliament needed to give a " clear sign " that there are still insufficient legal grounds for carrying out such searches .
he also said he could imagine allowing such monitoring in particularly grievous cases , but then only under oversight of the court .
schäuble : ' let 's look at article 13 ' interior minister schäuble told parliament that online data searches should not be allowed without a legal foundation .
if the searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy , " then let ’ s think about whether we want to expand article 13 , " he said .
following the german federal court ’ s decision , schäuble had lobbied hard for a legal provision to allow police to do on-line searches .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are absolutely necessary , but they need a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
the social democrats reproached them that the statements were meant to imply the spd is opposed to online searches , although " they themselves started the searches . "
opposition is outspoken bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat schily signed work decrees on spying in 2005 green party interior expert silke stokar told afp news service that the " secret working decrees " acted to bypass parliament .
" it is simply anti-constitutional , " she said .
greens party chief claudia roth said both intelligence agencies , the bfv and bnd , clearly consider " civil rights and informational self-determination from the perspective of a wrecking company . "
max stadler , interior expert from the liberal fdp party , called for the german government to terminate the searches instantly .
" lawmakers should keep their hands off of online searches , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
fdp parliamentarian gisela piltz said the budget for searches should be blocked .

members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , who were present at a meeting of the committee on wednesday , reported fritsche ’ s comments to the press .
representatives from all political parties criticized the highly controversial practice as unlawful .
germany ’ s commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , told afp news service he thinks the practice is anti-constitutional , and said the matter would be looked into immediately .
meanwhile , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called for a change in the law for online computer monitoring .
spying allowed by schily the chancellor ’ s office said that in light of terrorism threats , examining pc hard drives is an " important intelligence tool . "
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far is too far ?
government spies have been accessing private data via the internet computer-monitoring by germany ’ s interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been possible since the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it , in june , 2005 .
according to the chancellor ’ s office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
social democratic interior committee chairman , sebastian edathy , told afp that schily ’ s regulations were " not a sustainable -lrb- legal -rrb- basis . "
the number of searches undertaken were only " in the single digits , " he said , but added that the parliament needed to give a " clear sign " that there are still insufficient legal grounds for carrying out such searches .
he also said he could imagine allowing such monitoring in particularly grievous cases , but then only under oversight of the court .
schäuble : ' let 's look at article 13 ' interior minister schäuble told parliament that online data searches should not be allowed without a legal foundation .
if the searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy , " then let ’ s think about whether we want to expand article 13 , " he said .
following the german federal court ’ s decision , schäuble had lobbied hard for a legal provision to allow police to do on-line searches .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are absolutely necessary , but they need a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
the social democrats reproached them that the statements were meant to imply the spd is opposed to online searches , although " they themselves started the searches . "
opposition is outspoken bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat schily signed work decrees on spying in 2005 green party interior expert silke stokar told afp news service that the " secret working decrees " acted to bypass parliament .

greens party chief claudia roth said both intelligence agencies , the bfv and bnd , clearly consider " civil rights and informational self-determination from the perspective of a wrecking company . "
max stadler , interior expert from the liberal fdp party , called for the german government to terminate the searches instantly .
" lawmakers should keep their hands off of online searches , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .
new age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff practically brought the berlin wall down now , there is knut - berlin 's cuddly sensation , the polar bear who was rejected by his mother , but adopted by an entire city .
unlike jfk and david hasselhoff , knut did n't want to become a berliner .
his idea of fun involves fish and freezing cold showers , not jelly doughnuts and screaming children .
but he had no saying in the whole matter and he is now the most famous living berliner , an overnight celebrity , a symbol of the fight against global warming and the hairiest celebrity ever to make the cover of vanity fair .
a new website called youknut - in reference to the popular internet video sharing site youtube - has been set up as a place for kunt fans to share their stories , songs and video about their favorite berliner .
one user posted a poem called " knut , oh knut , " while another used the site to announce he was looking for the nice girl he had met on the subway who wore the youknut badge .
and the cynics thought that there was no place for poetry or love in today 's world ?
the dark side of fame real celebrities always polarize .
think paris hilton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , knut , what a guy !
another german website , ominously called kill-knut.com , is built on the knowledge that the public almost always has a love-hate relationship with objects of their desire .
it invites its visitors to play online games involving their puffy white hero .
one is called " kill knut , " the other - " feed knut . "
the choice is yours .
if you are a hormonally imbalanced teenager or a disturbed person with unresolved aggression issues , you will try to shoot as many polar bears as possible .
if , on the other hand , you are an environmentally-conscious softie who eats organic food , wears sandals and hugs trees as a matter of principle , you can earn your game points by throwing fish at hyperactive polar bears .
for each polar bear shot or fed , you get one point .
the game statistics shows that cyber-killers seem more determined than cyber-feeders .
on april 26 , the reigning top " polar bear killer " had earned 39,400 points , whereas his " feeder " counterpart had collected only 30,000 .
if knut grows up to be a bitter old polar bear , it should come as no surprise at all . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germans might have a reputation of being a little grim and glum , but they 're not all sourpusses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.04.2007 german beekeepers fighting for the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bee populations have been devastated - the reason why is unclear bee populations in the us have dramatically dropped over the last six months .
german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .
here we almost look after every single colony . "
age factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honey as well as wax and royal jelly are products that come from beekeeping on the other hand , german apiary faces its own difficulties .
" beekeepers here tend to be loners , " said schricker , who has been studying bees since becoming a student of zoology in the 1960s .
" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .
politicians have n't realized the value of honey bees . "
age is also a major issue .
friedrich said federation members are , on average , 60 years old , while most of the people taking up the hobby also tend to be 40 and over .
the mobility required in today 's society makes it difficult to persuade young people to take up the hobby , she said .
" the age structure remains a problem , " friedrich said .
" the tendency is positive .
more women are joining .
up to now it has always tended to be a bit of a male domain .
but more beekeepers are dying than are taking up the hobby .
if we are to keep it alive , we need lots of new people . "
across the country , a whole variety of courses are on offer to introduce people all ages to beekeeping .
in bavaria , a leasing scheme has been launched to allow potential beekeepers to try out the pastime .
city bees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recruitment drive is on to find young beekeepers and although beekeeping has traditionally been very much a rural pastime that does not mean that city dwellers have to be excluded .
" even in berlin people keep bees , " schricker said .
" in allotments , on rooftop gardens and even on their balconies . "
a berlin bee has even been bred especially to suit urban conditions .
" it has certain characteristics such as docility and it is also attracted to blossom that you can find in the city - tree blossom mainly , " he said .
while people may not have to live in the country to become a beekeeper , a dollop of idealism helps .
the profits that can be made from selling hand-harvested honey tend to be limited .
" it 's a nice hobby , " schricker said .
" you also have to appreciate the social value too .
keeping bees is a very good way to react to climate change .
here on the ground it 's a way each one of us can do something for the future .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi warplanes turned guernica into a landscape of pain and destruction the attack on april 26 , 1937 leveled three-quarters of the historic town , killing hundreds of the roughly 6,000 people which called it home at the time .
" in the panel on which i am working , which i shall call guernica , and in all my recent works of art , i clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk spain in an ocean of pain and death , " picasso was quoted as saying as he worked on the mural .
history of a painting today , marking the 70th anniversary of the attack by the nazi 's condor legion on the basque town , an exhibition at the wall museum in berlin entitled " pablo picasso .
guernica .
history of a painting " explores the genesis of a unique work that is considered by many as modern art 's most powerful anti-war symbol .
" picasso created a painting that is still very moving , " said director of the berlin wall museum alexandra hildebrandt .
" it does n't show airplanes or enemies .
it 's filled with dead and injured bodies .
it could 've carried the name of ' dresden ' or ' hiroshima . " '
" thanks to picasso 's famous painting , guernica 's name has not been forgotten , which is what happened to many other places with a similar destiny , " hildebrandt said .
the berlin exhibition , which opened on wednesday , has been set up by spanish book publisher and curator jacobo armero .
bildunterschrift : picasso 's " guernica " is a testimony to the power of art a symbol of national pride for many basques " guernica " is an important symbol of their national identity as the town is considered the centre of their cultural traditions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.04.2007 german beekeepers fighting for the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bee populations have been devastated - the reason why is unclear bee populations in the us have dramatically dropped over the last six months .
german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .
here we almost look after every single colony . "
age factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honey as well as wax and royal jelly are products that come from beekeeping on the other hand , german apiary faces its own difficulties .
" beekeepers here tend to be loners , " said schricker , who has been studying bees since becoming a student of zoology in the 1960s .
" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .
politicians have n't realized the value of honey bees . "
age is also a major issue .
friedrich said federation members are , on average , 60 years old , while most of the people taking up the hobby also tend to be 40 and over .
the mobility required in today 's society makes it difficult to persuade young people to take up the hobby , she said .
" the age structure remains a problem , " friedrich said .
" the tendency is positive .
more women are joining .
up to now it has always tended to be a bit of a male domain .
but more beekeepers are dying than are taking up the hobby .
if we are to keep it alive , we need lots of new people . "
across the country , a whole variety of courses are on offer to introduce people all ages to beekeeping .
in bavaria , a leasing scheme has been launched to allow potential beekeepers to try out the pastime .
city bees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recruitment drive is on to find young beekeepers and although beekeeping has traditionally been very much a rural pastime that does not mean that city dwellers have to be excluded .
" even in berlin people keep bees , " schricker said .
" in allotments , on rooftop gardens and even on their balconies . "
a berlin bee has even been bred especially to suit urban conditions .
" it has certain characteristics such as docility and it is also attracted to blossom that you can find in the city - tree blossom mainly , " he said .
while people may not have to live in the country to become a beekeeper , a dollop of idealism helps .
the profits that can be made from selling hand-harvested honey tend to be limited .
" it 's a nice hobby , " schricker said .
" you also have to appreciate the social value too .
keeping bees is a very good way to react to climate change .
here on the ground it 's a way each one of us can do something for the future .

now , he is going into television . former germany boss jürgen klinsmann revealed on thursday he is set to return to coaching and will be spending the summer considering job offers - from both clubs and countries . despite german press reports on thursday stating klinsmann had effectively ruled himself out of coaching english premiership champions chelsea by taking a job with german tv , the 42-year old insists he wants to coach again . klinsmann will work as an analyst and commentator for pay-tv channel arena for the next two years and will fly to germany from his home in california for major bundesliga games . the arena network has confirmed that klinsmann will get his own show on a two-year contract starting next season .
the show will feature commentary and analysis around bundesliga matches and important games in foreign leagues . " i do n't see myself as the classic tv expert , " said klinsmann , " but rather as an observer who enjoys football as much as the fans do . " competing for the star coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi was no stranger to tv during his tenure as coach but the ex-german striker insists he is also ready to coach again after taking a break having led germany to third-place at last year 's world cup on home soil . " whatever happens , i want to get back into the coaching game .
we 'll have to see whether that happens sooner or later , " klinsmann said at a press conference organised by arena . he said he has told his new employers he may be taking up a coaching role in the future after receiving offers " from teams and from national federations . " " i made sure arena are aware of that , so if i accepted a coaching post , our collaboration can be suspended at any time , " specified klinsmann .
" there are a certain number of proposals from clubs and national federations on the table , i am going to wait until this summer to analyse and sort out the offers to make a decision . " klinsmann would not specify which jobs he is considering , but he has been tipped to succeed jose mourinho at chelsea . tired , emotional and burnt out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching took a lot out of klinsi - but he will be back and the former tottenham , inter milan and bayern munich forward explained why he stood down as german coach , saying he was " burned out " after two years in charge and needed to " recharge his batteries " . " it was necessary that i took a break after the world cup , it was difficult for my family .
during the last 10 months , i have enjoyed a normal family life and i also took time to assess the world cup . " klinsmann had also been in talks with the united states soccer federation last year over its bid to replace incumbent us coach bruce arena with the california-based german soccer hero .
but in december , klinsmann gave up on the idea when it became clear that he would have no control over team matters .
bob bradley is now the interim boss of the us-team as it searches for a permanent replacement . earlier this year , klinsmann had also been informally approached by the australian team , according to australian media reports .
klinsmann was reported to have discussed real estate but also football business with peter lowy , the son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy . although the tv contract has put his career as a football coach on hold for at least two years , the charismatic klinsi recently dropped a hint that he might be back for the world cup 2010 .
" who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said at a fifa conference in berlin . from underdog to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with a german national hero klinsmann became a national hero when he led the german team to third place in last year 's world cup .
but he stepped down as germany head coach four days after the tournament , saying it was time to move on . klinsmann , who lives with his wife and two children in california , said then that his " big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them . "
he added that " after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " his new job as a television commentator is bound to afford the legendary klinsmann a more comfortable daily routine . in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , klinsmann endured scathing criticism from the tabloid press and some of his colleagues in the business .
critics viewed klinsmann 's coaching strategy with contempt , as he recruited many younger players into the team and was known for his unorthodox training methods .
klinsmann was also chided for his decision to commute to germany from california . but germany 's strong showing in the world cup took most observers - including germany fans - by surprise and silenced even the most relentless critics .
klinsmann subsequently became known as the " golden bomber " for his blonde hair and aggressive playing tactics . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said when it was over .
" we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . "
for that achievement , klinsmann was awarded the medal of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- by the german government . as a player , klinsmann claimed a world cup title in 1990 , when germany beat argentina 1-0 , and went on to play for france , italy and england .
after a brief stint as a striker for california 's orange county blue star , klinsmann retired in 1998 and began his career as a coach . dw staff -lrb- ab / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "
an unprecedented deployment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants the osce to get involved putin said the missile defense plan , if carried out , would mark an unprecedented deployment in europe of us strategic weaponry and said this was an issue that should be of concern not just in us-russian bilateral relations but on the continent as a whole .
" in one way or another , this affects the interests of all european states including those that are not members of nato , " putin said .
the russian leader said the matter should be taken up by the vienna-based organization for security and cooperation -lrb- osce -rrb- , a body that moscow has for years accused of veering from its original mission to deal with security matters in europe toward promotion of a us political agenda .
" it is time to give the activities of the osce some real content , to turn the face of the organization toward the problems that really concern the people of europe instead of only looking to build -lrb- political -rrb- blocs in the post-soviet space , " putin said . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense secretary winds up missile shield push in germany the united states will continue to consult with its allies and russia on washington 's plans to install a missile shield in europe , us defense secretary robert gates said in berlin .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "

the show will feature commentary and analysis around bundesliga matches and important games in foreign leagues . " i do n't see myself as the classic tv expert , " said klinsmann , " but rather as an observer who enjoys football as much as the fans do .

we 'll have to see whether that happens sooner or later , " klinsmann said at a press conference organised by arena . he said he has told his new employers he may be taking up a coaching role in the future after receiving offers " from teams and from national federations . " " i made sure arena are aware of that , so if i accepted a coaching post , our collaboration can be suspended at any time , " specified klinsmann .

" it was necessary that i took a break after the world cup , it was difficult for my family .
during the last 10 months , i have enjoyed a normal family life and i also took time to assess the world cup . " klinsmann had also been in talks with the united states soccer federation last year over its bid to replace incumbent us coach bruce arena with the california-based german soccer hero .

bob bradley is now the interim boss of the us-team as it searches for a permanent replacement . earlier this year , klinsmann had also been informally approached by the australian team , according to australian media reports .
klinsmann was reported to have discussed real estate but also football business with peter lowy , the son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy . although the tv contract has put his career as a football coach on hold for at least two years , the charismatic klinsi recently dropped a hint that he might be back for the world cup 2010 .

he added that " after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " his new job as a television commentator is bound to afford the legendary klinsmann a more comfortable daily routine . in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , klinsmann endured scathing criticism from the tabloid press and some of his colleagues in the business .
critics viewed klinsmann 's coaching strategy with contempt , as he recruited many younger players into the team and was known for his unorthodox training methods .
klinsmann was also chided for his decision to commute to germany from california . but germany 's strong showing in the world cup took most observers - including germany fans - by surprise and silenced even the most relentless critics .

" klinsmann would not specify which jobs he is considering , but he has been tipped to succeed jose mourinho at chelsea . tired , emotional and burnt out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching took a lot out of klinsi - but he will be back and the former tottenham , inter milan and bayern munich forward explained why he stood down as german coach , saying he was " burned out " after two years in charge and needed to " recharge his batteries " . " it was necessary that i took a break after the world cup , it was difficult for my family .
during the last 10 months , i have enjoyed a normal family life and i also took time to assess the world cup . " klinsmann had also been in talks with the united states soccer federation last year over its bid to replace incumbent us coach bruce arena with the california-based german soccer hero .
but in december , klinsmann gave up on the idea when it became clear that he would have no control over team matters .
bob bradley is now the interim boss of the us-team as it searches for a permanent replacement . earlier this year , klinsmann had also been informally approached by the australian team , according to australian media reports .
klinsmann was reported to have discussed real estate but also football business with peter lowy , the son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy . although the tv contract has put his career as a football coach on hold for at least two years , the charismatic klinsi recently dropped a hint that he might be back for the world cup 2010 .
" who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said at a fifa conference in berlin . from underdog to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with a german national hero klinsmann became a national hero when he led the german team to third place in last year 's world cup .
but he stepped down as germany head coach four days after the tournament , saying it was time to move on . klinsmann , who lives with his wife and two children in california , said then that his " big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them . "
he added that " after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " his new job as a television commentator is bound to afford the legendary klinsmann a more comfortable daily routine . in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , klinsmann endured scathing criticism from the tabloid press and some of his colleagues in the business .
critics viewed klinsmann 's coaching strategy with contempt , as he recruited many younger players into the team and was known for his unorthodox training methods .
klinsmann was also chided for his decision to commute to germany from california . but germany 's strong showing in the world cup took most observers - including germany fans - by surprise and silenced even the most relentless critics .
klinsmann subsequently became known as the " golden bomber " for his blonde hair and aggressive playing tactics . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said when it was over .
" we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . "
for that achievement , klinsmann was awarded the medal of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- by the german government . as a player , klinsmann claimed a world cup title in 1990 , when germany beat argentina 1-0 , and went on to play for france , italy and england .
after a brief stint as a striker for california 's orange county blue star , klinsmann retired in 1998 and began his career as a coach . dw staff -lrb- ab / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .

" read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .
what we found in many of the incidents is that the shooters were , actually , treated unjustly .
in erfurt , -lrb- the shooter robert -rrb- steinhäuser had to leave school in the 12th grade .
and he was kicked out for quite a minor infraction .
at this point , he had nothing to do ; he was totally lost .
in emsdetten , the shooter was treated unfairly by his peers .

" read a sign outside the erfurt school after the shooting in 2002 on the fifth anniversary of germany 's worst school massacre , dw-world.de spoke to jens hoffmann , a psychologist whose research focuses on the detection and prevention of mass killings in schools and businesses . five years ago in the eastern german town of erfurt , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser went on a shooting rampage , killing 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman before turning the weapon on himself .
the event sent shock waves through the country and sparked widespread soul-searching on topics from teenage alienation and violent video games through mass media and gun control .
just last year , another school shooting took place in emsdetten in northern germany , leaving 37 injured and the 18 year old gunman dead .
jens hoffmann is a psychologist whose project at the technical university of darmstadt – ironically , the german sister school of virginia tech university , which saw its own horrific killing spree on april 16 - developed an early detection method to identify those at risk for mass violence .
he teaches the method to law enforcement agencies , schools and businesses .
dw-world.de : dr. hoffmann , what does your project and method do ?
jens hoffmann : after the school shooting in erfurt in 2002 , we began to wonder if anything could be done about it .
we found that in the united states there was already quite a lot of research on early warning signals about these attackers .
so we analyzed german cases and we found just about the same signals .
they were almost identical .
after that , we developed instruments to analyze the communication of people who are estranged , and their other behaviors , and the best way to intervene .
now we mostly offer two-day workshops for school psychologists , policemen , and people working in schools and companies .
we teach them how to make risk assessments in their own organizations .
briefly , what do you tell people to look out for ?
first , something must have gone wrong for the attacker .
he has a problem and he ca n't get over it .
and he is very angry .
they are always very depressive and very angry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann : ' five years ago , no one was interested ' then they start to think about a violent solution for their problem , so they talk about violent things .
they do something we call " leaking , " giving direct or indirect signals , like the plays the -lrb- virginia tech -rrb- attacker wrote before he attacked .
people were aware that he wrote very violent things .
then they start to prepare their attacks .
they start to think , " when can i do it ? "
they talk more in detail about it .
and then finally , they come out with a statement that something big is going to happen .
if they have friends they tell them , " do n't go to the high school on this day . "
so we have quite a lot of signals , and the closer we come to the attack , the more sure we can be that this person may see a violent attack as an answer to his problem .
what should people do if they recognize a crisis ?
people preparing for an attack like this might start giving away their possessions to friends ; they engage in what we call " final act behavior . "
the school shooter last year in emsdetten gave away his favorite gun to a friend .
another late warning signal that shows a very high risk is that they might talk to friends or peers about attacks by other school shooters .
so it is important that if you are worried about someone , you have to ask the people around them if they have seen any of these signs .
like if they are desperate , and say they do n't know how to go on .
it often seems clear in retrospect that someone was on the brink , but these events keep happening anyway .
why is that ?
well , many events have , actually , been stopped through prevention .
in the united states there are very good programs .
in the case of virginia tech , they just had bad luck , actually , that there was n't a case manager there .
we need more ‘ threat managers ' in schools and organizations who can recognize the risk signals .
they can say " there may be someone in crisis here . "
and if we understand that these people are in a crisis - that 's why they do these attacks , because they are in crisis - the earlier on they get help , the less risk that something will happen .
the first thing a threat manager should do is talk to the person that people are worried about .
and in most of the cases there is nothing behind it and everything is ok .
so you teach prevention ?
yes , its very much about behavior-based prevention .
not in the classical psychological way of looking at what are the people saying .
its much more hands on : what do we need to look at in an organization , what do people say or do that we should perhaps be worried about ?
what are the warning signals ?
what are people saying ?
very often people who are desperate are more dangerous than people who are saying , ‘ i 'm going to kill someone . '
it is a new way of dealing with the field of threat assessment and threat management .
we 've learned a lot from our colleagues in the united states on this .
trying to raise flags about killing sprees is quite a gruesome topic .
how has your work been received in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emsdetten shooter made a goodbye speech on the internet - in english right after erfurt , in 2002 , no one was interested .
we had to fund the programs with our own money .
but then there was emsdetten and that lead to huge interest .
nobody thinks this is actually going to happen where they live .
and before , nobody believed our message : that there are always warning signals , and that these can be detected .
but this has changed now .
what would it take to make these detection methods widespread ?
people just need to be taught about the risk models , about the dynamics behind that .
they do n't need to be psychologists .
you need to train people to know what to look for – just one , two , or three people in an organization , who could turn around and train the other people .
the most important thing is that such a program be supported from the top .
because you have to have the structure , the people have to have some time to make the effort .
interestingly , because of the events at its partner school virginia tech , the tu darmstadt is putting this kind of training program into place .
how big a role does the media play in causing events like erfurt ?
the terrible thing is , this is a new form of violence , due to the fact of the media and the internet .
it 's a new way for desperate , mostly young men - only 4 percent have been women - to " be someone . "
they feel lost , they feel people have behaved unfairly to them , and they need some form of revenge to show that they are someone .
this is quite new .
they always look at columbine .
almost every school shooter saw columbine as some sort of blueprint .
they read about it , and they identified with the columbine killers .
and the newest terrible thing is to leave some sort of final message .
the school shooter in emsdetten did it , too .
they put it into the internet , send it out to the media , and they can fantasize before they are dead that afterward , everyone will hear them , everyone will see them .
the us made a horrible mistake when it published the videos of the virginia school shooter .
it 's the worst thing they could have done .
now there is a higher likelihood of a copycat crime .
we tend to think of erfurt-type school shootings as a modern phenomenon .
yet i 've seen references to killing sprees going back to the 1920s .
is this really an age-old issue ?
well , the earlier cases were people from outside who attacked the schools .
before the middle of the 1990s , there were almost no school-shooter cases like those we know today , with young killers who are in school , or were in the school .
around 1992 or 1995 , you begin to have a terrible new dimension of this sort of crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe 's romantic hero werther set off his own series of copycat crimes we know from earlier psychological research that there is something called the " werther effect , " named after the goethe book -lrb- the sorrows of young werther , about a romantic character who shot himself in the head , published in 1774 – eds . -rrb-
even back then there were a series of copycat suicides , where young men would be found shot , dressed like werther , or they were found dead with the book next to them .
so the mass-media effect is an old one , it probably dates back to the first printed books .
but what is new is that in every room , there is now internet access .
you can get lots and lots of information .
you have video sequences , you can see the attack on columbine , you know a lot about these attackers .
and the newest dimension is that you can make your final statement to the world .
its amazing : the school shooter in emsdetten gave a speech in english , even though he was a german , because he said " i want to know that the whole world hears my story . "
so yes , we have a new dimension because of mass media , and because of a long tradition that began 200 years earlier .
but there is a new quality to it .
why do you think schools are so often the focal point of these shootings ?
why not other public places - restaurants or theaters ?
schools , courthouses , they are common targets .
these are organizations that have a big influence on other people .
if you have a problem in school or in court , or your workplace … it has a huge influence on your life .
it is very much about identity , which may be at risk .
what you find especially with people who are very desperate , who do n't know how to cope with things and feel angry , is that they feel unfairly treated .
in fact a big aspect of prevention may be to focus on making sure people are dealt with fairly .
what we found in many of the incidents is that the shooters were , actually , treated unjustly .
in erfurt , -lrb- the shooter robert -rrb- steinhäuser had to leave school in the 12th grade .
and he was kicked out for quite a minor infraction .
at this point , he had nothing to do ; he was totally lost .
in emsdetten , the shooter was treated unfairly by his peers .
making procedures to deal with these could be a big step toward toward prevention . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virginia shooting causes shockwaves in germany 's erfurt the shock of the virginia shooting massacre is being echoed in the eastern german city of erfurt , where there were calls for tighter gun control laws after a student shot dead 16 people at his high school five years ago .

but in last weekend 's loss to stuttgart , munich ran out of luck - to many fans ' delight . with nineteen bundesliga titles to their name , bayern munich are used to lording it over the rest of the league .
munich haters often refer to their new stadium , the allianzarena as the " arrogance arena , " and bayern president franz beckenbauer once dismissed the uefa cup as a competition for losers . but the uefa cup - and not , as is customary , the champions league - is precisely where bayern would be if the season ended today .
five points behind third-place stuttgart , once-mighty munich will struggle to salvage anything from this season . and the prospect of seeing the bundesliga 's titan drop into the ranks of the also-rans for the first time in more than a decade has many fans rubbing their hands with glee . the tabloid bild newspaper described the team as " idiots " and " losers in lederhosen " after their desultory performance in stuttgart .
and the bz newspaper wrote : " they used to brag that they were stronger than ox .
but now they 're the ones getting gored .

but in last weekend 's loss to stuttgart , munich ran out of luck - to many fans ' delight . with nineteen bundesliga titles to their name , bayern munich are used to lording it over the rest of the league .
munich haters often refer to their new stadium , the allianzarena as the " arrogance arena , " and bayern president franz beckenbauer once dismissed the uefa cup as a competition for losers . but the uefa cup - and not , as is customary , the champions league - is precisely where bayern would be if the season ended today .
five points behind third-place stuttgart , once-mighty munich will struggle to salvage anything from this season . and the prospect of seeing the bundesliga 's titan drop into the ranks of the also-rans for the first time in more than a decade has many fans rubbing their hands with glee . the tabloid bild newspaper described the team as " idiots " and " losers in lederhosen " after their desultory performance in stuttgart .
and the bz newspaper wrote : " they used to brag that they were stronger than ox .
but now they 're the ones getting gored .

dw 's karl zawadzky comments on what the leadership crisis means for germany 's biggest electronics company . those who thought that supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer would be the last to go in connection with the siemens corruption scandal have been proven wrong : chief executive klaus kleinfeld will give up his post , too .
and he 's unlikely to be the last sacrifice in the executive suite .
siemens managerial board members are facing federal prosecutors ; one active member spent time in police custody as did a former board member .
in an open power struggle , the supervisory board refused to extend kleinfeld 's contract .
kleinfeld had no choice but to announce his voluntary resignation .
thus , he avoided getting fired .
the fate of top professionals at this globally active company is not the issue .
the issue is siemens itself .
the way the crisis has been managed is just as scandalous as the actual events that caused it .
up to 400 million euros -lrb- $ 540 million -rrb- - a gigantic sum - were embezzled for bribes to win massive contracts in countries prone to corruption .
investigators are feverishly searching for proof of corruption , for the perpetrators and for those responsible .
so far , no one believes that long-time ceo von pierer or his successor , kleinfeld , was personally involved in the scandal or even that they were aware of the bribes .
but they are nevertheless not free of responsibility .
how could millions and millions disappear into shady channels without the boss knowing anything about it ?
if that was the case , then there was a lack of control and control mechanisms .
perhaps the company 's executives did n't look too closely , because then an otherwise prevalent practice that led so nicely to large contracts would n't have worked anymore ?
that 's just a suspicion .
but it 's enough .
on top of it all comes a scandal within a scandal : siemens violated german law by putting millions of euros into the foundation of an employer-friendly organization to represent workers which was meant to undermine the trade union .
divide and conquer was the strategy .
it 's true that without a thorough clean-up at the top , siemens wo n't be able to make a credible new start .
however , the employers ' representatives in the supervisory board behaved extremely unprofessionally , causing the company further damage .
with nearly 500,000 employees , plants , joint ventures and offices in practically every country in the world , siemens is one of the biggest global companies - and now it has no leadership .
the concern is desperately searching for a new ceo .
that provides an ideal opportunity for carpetbaggers who long ago first suggested breaking up the company and selling off its individual parts .

now , he is going into television . former germany boss jürgen klinsmann revealed on thursday he is set to return to coaching and will be spending the summer considering job offers - from both clubs and countries . despite german press reports on thursday stating klinsmann had effectively ruled himself out of coaching english premiership champions chelsea by taking a job with german tv , the 42-year old insists he wants to coach again . klinsmann will work as an analyst and commentator for pay-tv channel arena for the next two years and will fly to germany from his home in california for major bundesliga games . the arena network has confirmed that klinsmann will get his own show on a two-year contract starting next season .
the show will feature commentary and analysis around bundesliga matches and important games in foreign leagues . " i do n't see myself as the classic tv expert , " said klinsmann , " but rather as an observer who enjoys football as much as the fans do . " competing for the star coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi was no stranger to tv during his tenure as coach but the ex-german striker insists he is also ready to coach again after taking a break having led germany to third-place at last year 's world cup on home soil . " whatever happens , i want to get back into the coaching game .
we 'll have to see whether that happens sooner or later , " klinsmann said at a press conference organised by arena . he said he has told his new employers he may be taking up a coaching role in the future after receiving offers " from teams and from national federations . " " i made sure arena are aware of that , so if i accepted a coaching post , our collaboration can be suspended at any time , " specified klinsmann .
" there are a certain number of proposals from clubs and national federations on the table , i am going to wait until this summer to analyse and sort out the offers to make a decision . " klinsmann would not specify which jobs he is considering , but he has been tipped to succeed jose mourinho at chelsea . tired , emotional and burnt out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching took a lot out of klinsi - but he will be back and the former tottenham , inter milan and bayern munich forward explained why he stood down as german coach , saying he was " burned out " after two years in charge and needed to " recharge his batteries " . " it was necessary that i took a break after the world cup , it was difficult for my family .
during the last 10 months , i have enjoyed a normal family life and i also took time to assess the world cup . " klinsmann had also been in talks with the united states soccer federation last year over its bid to replace incumbent us coach bruce arena with the california-based german soccer hero .
but in december , klinsmann gave up on the idea when it became clear that he would have no control over team matters .
bob bradley is now the interim boss of the us-team as it searches for a permanent replacement . earlier this year , klinsmann had also been informally approached by the australian team , according to australian media reports .
klinsmann was reported to have discussed real estate but also football business with peter lowy , the son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy . although the tv contract has put his career as a football coach on hold for at least two years , the charismatic klinsi recently dropped a hint that he might be back for the world cup 2010 .
" who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said at a fifa conference in berlin . from underdog to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with a german national hero klinsmann became a national hero when he led the german team to third place in last year 's world cup .
but he stepped down as germany head coach four days after the tournament , saying it was time to move on . klinsmann , who lives with his wife and two children in california , said then that his " big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them . "
he added that " after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " his new job as a television commentator is bound to afford the legendary klinsmann a more comfortable daily routine . in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , klinsmann endured scathing criticism from the tabloid press and some of his colleagues in the business .
critics viewed klinsmann 's coaching strategy with contempt , as he recruited many younger players into the team and was known for his unorthodox training methods .
klinsmann was also chided for his decision to commute to germany from california . but germany 's strong showing in the world cup took most observers - including germany fans - by surprise and silenced even the most relentless critics .
klinsmann subsequently became known as the " golden bomber " for his blonde hair and aggressive playing tactics . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said when it was over .
" we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . "
for that achievement , klinsmann was awarded the medal of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- by the german government . as a player , klinsmann claimed a world cup title in 1990 , when germany beat argentina 1-0 , and went on to play for france , italy and england .
after a brief stint as a striker for california 's orange county blue star , klinsmann retired in 1998 and began his career as a coach . dw staff -lrb- ab / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .

german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .
here we almost look after every single colony . "
age factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honey as well as wax and royal jelly are products that come from beekeeping on the other hand , german apiary faces its own difficulties .
" beekeepers here tend to be loners , " said schricker , who has been studying bees since becoming a student of zoology in the 1960s .
" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .
politicians have n't realized the value of honey bees . "
age is also a major issue .
friedrich said federation members are , on average , 60 years old , while most of the people taking up the hobby also tend to be 40 and over .
the mobility required in today 's society makes it difficult to persuade young people to take up the hobby , she said .
" the age structure remains a problem , " friedrich said .
" the tendency is positive .
more women are joining .
up to now it has always tended to be a bit of a male domain .
but more beekeepers are dying than are taking up the hobby .
if we are to keep it alive , we need lots of new people . "
across the country , a whole variety of courses are on offer to introduce people all ages to beekeeping .
in bavaria , a leasing scheme has been launched to allow potential beekeepers to try out the pastime .
city bees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recruitment drive is on to find young beekeepers and although beekeeping has traditionally been very much a rural pastime that does not mean that city dwellers have to be excluded .
" even in berlin people keep bees , " schricker said .
" in allotments , on rooftop gardens and even on their balconies . "
a berlin bee has even been bred especially to suit urban conditions .
" it has certain characteristics such as docility and it is also attracted to blossom that you can find in the city - tree blossom mainly , " he said .
while people may not have to live in the country to become a beekeeper , a dollop of idealism helps .
the profits that can be made from selling hand-harvested honey tend to be limited .
" it 's a nice hobby , " schricker said .
" you also have to appreciate the social value too .
keeping bees is a very good way to react to climate change .
here on the ground it 's a way each one of us can do something for the future .

now , he is going into television . former germany boss jürgen klinsmann revealed on thursday he is set to return to coaching and will be spending the summer considering job offers - from both clubs and countries . despite german press reports on thursday stating klinsmann had effectively ruled himself out of coaching english premiership champions chelsea by taking a job with german tv , the 42-year old insists he wants to coach again . klinsmann will work as an analyst and commentator for pay-tv channel arena for the next two years and will fly to germany from his home in california for major bundesliga games . the arena network has confirmed that klinsmann will get his own show on a two-year contract starting next season .
the show will feature commentary and analysis around bundesliga matches and important games in foreign leagues . " i do n't see myself as the classic tv expert , " said klinsmann , " but rather as an observer who enjoys football as much as the fans do . " competing for the star coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi was no stranger to tv during his tenure as coach but the ex-german striker insists he is also ready to coach again after taking a break having led germany to third-place at last year 's world cup on home soil . " whatever happens , i want to get back into the coaching game .
we 'll have to see whether that happens sooner or later , " klinsmann said at a press conference organised by arena . he said he has told his new employers he may be taking up a coaching role in the future after receiving offers " from teams and from national federations . " " i made sure arena are aware of that , so if i accepted a coaching post , our collaboration can be suspended at any time , " specified klinsmann .
" there are a certain number of proposals from clubs and national federations on the table , i am going to wait until this summer to analyse and sort out the offers to make a decision . " klinsmann would not specify which jobs he is considering , but he has been tipped to succeed jose mourinho at chelsea . tired , emotional and burnt out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching took a lot out of klinsi - but he will be back and the former tottenham , inter milan and bayern munich forward explained why he stood down as german coach , saying he was " burned out " after two years in charge and needed to " recharge his batteries " . " it was necessary that i took a break after the world cup , it was difficult for my family .
during the last 10 months , i have enjoyed a normal family life and i also took time to assess the world cup . " klinsmann had also been in talks with the united states soccer federation last year over its bid to replace incumbent us coach bruce arena with the california-based german soccer hero .
but in december , klinsmann gave up on the idea when it became clear that he would have no control over team matters .
bob bradley is now the interim boss of the us-team as it searches for a permanent replacement . earlier this year , klinsmann had also been informally approached by the australian team , according to australian media reports .
klinsmann was reported to have discussed real estate but also football business with peter lowy , the son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy . although the tv contract has put his career as a football coach on hold for at least two years , the charismatic klinsi recently dropped a hint that he might be back for the world cup 2010 .
" who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said at a fifa conference in berlin . from underdog to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with a german national hero klinsmann became a national hero when he led the german team to third place in last year 's world cup .
but he stepped down as germany head coach four days after the tournament , saying it was time to move on . klinsmann , who lives with his wife and two children in california , said then that his " big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them . "
he added that " after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " his new job as a television commentator is bound to afford the legendary klinsmann a more comfortable daily routine . in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , klinsmann endured scathing criticism from the tabloid press and some of his colleagues in the business .
critics viewed klinsmann 's coaching strategy with contempt , as he recruited many younger players into the team and was known for his unorthodox training methods .
klinsmann was also chided for his decision to commute to germany from california . but germany 's strong showing in the world cup took most observers - including germany fans - by surprise and silenced even the most relentless critics .
klinsmann subsequently became known as the " golden bomber " for his blonde hair and aggressive playing tactics . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said when it was over .
" we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . "
for that achievement , klinsmann was awarded the medal of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- by the german government . as a player , klinsmann claimed a world cup title in 1990 , when germany beat argentina 1-0 , and went on to play for france , italy and england .
after a brief stint as a striker for california 's orange county blue star , klinsmann retired in 1998 and began his career as a coach . dw staff -lrb- ab / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .

now , he is going into television . former germany boss jürgen klinsmann revealed on thursday he is set to return to coaching and will be spending the summer considering job offers - from both clubs and countries . despite german press reports on thursday stating klinsmann had effectively ruled himself out of coaching english premiership champions chelsea by taking a job with german tv , the 42-year old insists he wants to coach again . klinsmann will work as an analyst and commentator for pay-tv channel arena for the next two years and will fly to germany from his home in california for major bundesliga games . the arena network has confirmed that klinsmann will get his own show on a two-year contract starting next season .
the show will feature commentary and analysis around bundesliga matches and important games in foreign leagues . " i do n't see myself as the classic tv expert , " said klinsmann , " but rather as an observer who enjoys football as much as the fans do . " competing for the star coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi was no stranger to tv during his tenure as coach but the ex-german striker insists he is also ready to coach again after taking a break having led germany to third-place at last year 's world cup on home soil . " whatever happens , i want to get back into the coaching game .
we 'll have to see whether that happens sooner or later , " klinsmann said at a press conference organised by arena . he said he has told his new employers he may be taking up a coaching role in the future after receiving offers " from teams and from national federations . " " i made sure arena are aware of that , so if i accepted a coaching post , our collaboration can be suspended at any time , " specified klinsmann .
" there are a certain number of proposals from clubs and national federations on the table , i am going to wait until this summer to analyse and sort out the offers to make a decision . " klinsmann would not specify which jobs he is considering , but he has been tipped to succeed jose mourinho at chelsea . tired , emotional and burnt out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching took a lot out of klinsi - but he will be back and the former tottenham , inter milan and bayern munich forward explained why he stood down as german coach , saying he was " burned out " after two years in charge and needed to " recharge his batteries " . " it was necessary that i took a break after the world cup , it was difficult for my family .
during the last 10 months , i have enjoyed a normal family life and i also took time to assess the world cup . " klinsmann had also been in talks with the united states soccer federation last year over its bid to replace incumbent us coach bruce arena with the california-based german soccer hero .
but in december , klinsmann gave up on the idea when it became clear that he would have no control over team matters .
bob bradley is now the interim boss of the us-team as it searches for a permanent replacement . earlier this year , klinsmann had also been informally approached by the australian team , according to australian media reports .
klinsmann was reported to have discussed real estate but also football business with peter lowy , the son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy . although the tv contract has put his career as a football coach on hold for at least two years , the charismatic klinsi recently dropped a hint that he might be back for the world cup 2010 .
" who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said at a fifa conference in berlin . from underdog to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with a german national hero klinsmann became a national hero when he led the german team to third place in last year 's world cup .
but he stepped down as germany head coach four days after the tournament , saying it was time to move on . klinsmann , who lives with his wife and two children in california , said then that his " big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them . "
he added that " after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " his new job as a television commentator is bound to afford the legendary klinsmann a more comfortable daily routine . in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , klinsmann endured scathing criticism from the tabloid press and some of his colleagues in the business .
critics viewed klinsmann 's coaching strategy with contempt , as he recruited many younger players into the team and was known for his unorthodox training methods .
klinsmann was also chided for his decision to commute to germany from california . but germany 's strong showing in the world cup took most observers - including germany fans - by surprise and silenced even the most relentless critics .
klinsmann subsequently became known as the " golden bomber " for his blonde hair and aggressive playing tactics . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said when it was over .
" we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . "
for that achievement , klinsmann was awarded the medal of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- by the german government . as a player , klinsmann claimed a world cup title in 1990 , when germany beat argentina 1-0 , and went on to play for france , italy and england .
after a brief stint as a striker for california 's orange county blue star , klinsmann retired in 1998 and began his career as a coach . dw staff -lrb- ab / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .

members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , who were present at a meeting of the committee on wednesday , reported fritsche ’ s comments to the press .
representatives from all political parties criticized the highly controversial practice as unlawful .
germany ’ s commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , told afp news service he thinks the practice is anti-constitutional , and said the matter would be looked into immediately .
meanwhile , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called for a change in the law for online computer monitoring .

according to the chancellor ’ s office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
social democratic interior committee chairman , sebastian edathy , told afp that schily ’ s regulations were " not a sustainable -lrb- legal -rrb- basis . "
the number of searches undertaken were only " in the single digits , " he said , but added that the parliament needed to give a " clear sign " that there are still insufficient legal grounds for carrying out such searches .
he also said he could imagine allowing such monitoring in particularly grievous cases , but then only under oversight of the court .
schäuble : ' let 's look at article 13 ' interior minister schäuble told parliament that online data searches should not be allowed without a legal foundation .
if the searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy , " then let ’ s think about whether we want to expand article 13 , " he said .
following the german federal court ’ s decision , schäuble had lobbied hard for a legal provision to allow police to do on-line searches .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "

the spat between the long-time rivals came to a head when volker kauder , the christian democrats ' parliamentary group leader and a member of merkel 's inner circle , accused social democrats of grandstanding at germany 's expense .
" the spd is damaging the country , " he told news channel n24 after leading social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- went on the attack over conservative proposals to slash corporate taxes and eliminate the inheritance tax .
a member of the spd 's board , andreas nahles , shot back on rbb radio that it was " unbelievable " that the christian democrats would call for the tax cuts in direct violation of the government 's original coalition agreement .

merkel has also basked in the limelight of the dual presidencies of the european union and the group of eight club of wealthy nations that she assumed in january .
off their game at the same time , the social democrats have struggled to seize on issues that resonate with their rank-and-file members and appeal to centrist voters .
the party has plummeted to just 27 percent backing in opinion polls versus 34 percent for merkel 's conservatives .
" the spd is now futilely trying to boost its profile on any number of issues , " laurenz meyer of the cdu 's parliamentary group gloated in an interview with the daily leipziger volkszeitung .
" the poll numbers are apparently taking their toll . "
the conservatives have used their advantage to go on the offensive on a range of issues , often catching the social democrats off guard .
guenther beckstein , the powerful conservative state interior minister in bavaria , infuriated social democrats when he said they would share the blame for a future terrorist attack in germany for opposing cdu plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .

political paralysis " the spd is slowly realizing that the cdu / csu will not grant it any more major successes , " said the berlin daily tagesspiegel .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .
a question of compliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's speech could raise the stakes in russia 's security dispute with the west putin said russia , which did ratify the new treaty , had been complying with it on a unilateral basis and today had virtually no military forces deployed in the northwest and european areas of the country despite being the only cfe signatory with both northern and southern flanks to protect .
members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "
" this gives us every reason to say that our partners are acting in this situation incorrectly at a very minimum , " putin said in comments interrupted at one point by applause from the deputies from the state duma and the federation council gathered at the kremlin for the speech .
testy rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is concerned about nato 's expansion in eastern europe russia and the west have been disputing application of the adapted cfe treaty for years with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith .
but putin 's warning ratcheted the testy rhetoric up to the top level of the state and coincided with a rapid chilling in relations between russia and the united states over us plans to deploy elements of its new missile defense system in two former warsaw pact states near russia 's border .
the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "
an unprecedented deployment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants the osce to get involved putin said the missile defense plan , if carried out , would mark an unprecedented deployment in europe of us strategic weaponry and said this was an issue that should be of concern not just in us-russian bilateral relations but on the continent as a whole .
" in one way or another , this affects the interests of all european states including those that are not members of nato , " putin said .
the russian leader said the matter should be taken up by the vienna-based organization for security and cooperation -lrb- osce -rrb- , a body that moscow has for years accused of veering from its original mission to deal with security matters in europe toward promotion of a us political agenda .
" it is time to give the activities of the osce some real content , to turn the face of the organization toward the problems that really concern the people of europe instead of only looking to build -lrb- political -rrb- blocs in the post-soviet space , " putin said . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense secretary winds up missile shield push in germany the united states will continue to consult with its allies and russia on washington 's plans to install a missile shield in europe , us defense secretary robert gates said in berlin .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi warplanes turned guernica into a landscape of pain and destruction the attack on april 26 , 1937 leveled three-quarters of the historic town , killing hundreds of the roughly 6,000 people which called it home at the time .
" in the panel on which i am working , which i shall call guernica , and in all my recent works of art , i clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk spain in an ocean of pain and death , " picasso was quoted as saying as he worked on the mural .
history of a painting today , marking the 70th anniversary of the attack by the nazi 's condor legion on the basque town , an exhibition at the wall museum in berlin entitled " pablo picasso .
guernica .
history of a painting " explores the genesis of a unique work that is considered by many as modern art 's most powerful anti-war symbol .
" picasso created a painting that is still very moving , " said director of the berlin wall museum alexandra hildebrandt .
" it does n't show airplanes or enemies .
it 's filled with dead and injured bodies .
it could 've carried the name of ' dresden ' or ' hiroshima . " '
" thanks to picasso 's famous painting , guernica 's name has not been forgotten , which is what happened to many other places with a similar destiny , " hildebrandt said .
the berlin exhibition , which opened on wednesday , has been set up by spanish book publisher and curator jacobo armero .
bildunterschrift : picasso 's " guernica " is a testimony to the power of art a symbol of national pride for many basques " guernica " is an important symbol of their national identity as the town is considered the centre of their cultural traditions .
the town was once home to an oak tree which spanish kings would stand beneath and vow to respect an ancient code giving the independent-minded basques special rights .
the tree survived the bombing but died during a heat wave in 2003 and was replaced two years later .
after franco won the civil war and established a dictatorship , picasso arranged for the museum of modern art -lrb- moma -rrb- in new york keep the painting for as long as he was in power .
during the vietnam war , the room housing " guernica " at the us museum became the site of occasional anti-war vigils .
franco died in 1975 - two years after picasso - and in 1981 the painting arrived in newly democratic spain where it was housed first in an annex of madrid 's prado museum before being moved to the reina sofia , which is named after spain 's current queen .
around the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people died in the bombing of guernica the mural , which is 3.5 metres -lrb- 11 feet -rrb- tall and 7.8 metres wide , was exhibited in more than 50 different palces around the world between 1937 and 1957 , including brazil , germany and the united states .
the frequent moves during this time damaged the painting and it is now very fragile , the head of the museum 's conservation department , jorge garcia , told afp last year .
" it is unthinkable to wrap it up again , anyone who desires this is crazy , " he said at the time .
the 70th anniversary of the bombing has also led to renewed calls for picasso 's painting to be put on display in the town .
museum directors and the central government in madrid turned down the request , saying the painting was to fragile to be moved .
basque government officials said they would now try to have the painting moved to guernica in time for the 75th anniversary of the attack . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin exhibition explores art and science of pain a new exhibition in berlin aims to explore the many facets of human pain .

members of the us-led nato bloc have tied ratification of the adapted 1999 cfe treaty to withdrawal of russian forces from the ex-soviet republics of georgia and moldova , efforts which russia says have been under way and which are bilateral issues unrelated to the cfe pact .
" what about them ? "
putin said , referring to the nato countries which have not ratified the treaty .
" our partners have not even ratified the treaty . "

the russian president took direct aim at the us missile plans and linked it directly to the cfe treaty , stating : " it is high time for our partners to deliver their contribution to arms reduction , not just in word but in deed . "

members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , who were present at a meeting of the committee on wednesday , reported fritsche ’ s comments to the press .
representatives from all political parties criticized the highly controversial practice as unlawful .
germany ’ s commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , told afp news service he thinks the practice is anti-constitutional , and said the matter would be looked into immediately .
meanwhile , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called for a change in the law for online computer monitoring .
spying allowed by schily the chancellor ’ s office said that in light of terrorism threats , examining pc hard drives is an " important intelligence tool . "
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far is too far ?
government spies have been accessing private data via the internet computer-monitoring by germany ’ s interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been possible since the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it , in june , 2005 .
according to the chancellor ’ s office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
social democratic interior committee chairman , sebastian edathy , told afp that schily ’ s regulations were " not a sustainable -lrb- legal -rrb- basis . "
the number of searches undertaken were only " in the single digits , " he said , but added that the parliament needed to give a " clear sign " that there are still insufficient legal grounds for carrying out such searches .
he also said he could imagine allowing such monitoring in particularly grievous cases , but then only under oversight of the court .
schäuble : ' let 's look at article 13 ' interior minister schäuble told parliament that online data searches should not be allowed without a legal foundation .
if the searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy , " then let ’ s think about whether we want to expand article 13 , " he said .
following the german federal court ’ s decision , schäuble had lobbied hard for a legal provision to allow police to do on-line searches .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are absolutely necessary , but they need a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
the social democrats reproached them that the statements were meant to imply the spd is opposed to online searches , although " they themselves started the searches . "
opposition is outspoken bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat schily signed work decrees on spying in 2005 green party interior expert silke stokar told afp news service that the " secret working decrees " acted to bypass parliament .
" it is simply anti-constitutional , " she said .
greens party chief claudia roth said both intelligence agencies , the bfv and bnd , clearly consider " civil rights and informational self-determination from the perspective of a wrecking company . "
max stadler , interior expert from the liberal fdp party , called for the german government to terminate the searches instantly .
" lawmakers should keep their hands off of online searches , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
fdp parliamentarian gisela piltz said the budget for searches should be blocked .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general wants to hear more " nato allies attach great importance to the conventional forces in europe treaty ... it is important that the adapted cfe is ratified , " said scheffer at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in oslo .
scheffer said he had no doubt that president putin 's comments would be discussed at a meeting between nato foreign ministers and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in oslo later on thursday .
" i expect sergei lavrov to explain the words of his president , " scheffer said .
earlier on thursday , putin told the russian parliament in his annual state of the nation address that " it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence to this treaty until it has been ratified by all nato countries . "
" i suggest this issue be raised in the russia-nato council and , in the event there is no progress in negotiation , that we consider terminating our obligations under the cfe , " putin said .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact .
it was adapted in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact and the enlargement of nato , but nato states have not yet ratified the new pact .

now the tense calm that had reigned in their nearly 18 months in power is history .
the spat between the long-time rivals came to a head when volker kauder , the christian democrats ' parliamentary group leader and a member of merkel 's inner circle , accused social democrats of grandstanding at germany 's expense .
" the spd is damaging the country , " he told news channel n24 after leading social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- went on the attack over conservative proposals to slash corporate taxes and eliminate the inheritance tax .
a member of the spd 's board , andreas nahles , shot back on rbb radio that it was " unbelievable " that the christian democrats would call for the tax cuts in direct violation of the government 's original coalition agreement .
merkel enjoys limelight during its tenure , the " grand coalition " - the product of an inconclusive national election - merkel has deftly set the agenda and quashed dissent , sending her approval ratings soaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been feted in europe and elsewhere at the same time , the german economy - europe 's largest - has made a robust recovery , joblessness is falling and the public deficit is shrinking .
merkel has also basked in the limelight of the dual presidencies of the european union and the group of eight club of wealthy nations that she assumed in january .
off their game at the same time , the social democrats have struggled to seize on issues that resonate with their rank-and-file members and appeal to centrist voters .
the party has plummeted to just 27 percent backing in opinion polls versus 34 percent for merkel 's conservatives .
" the spd is now futilely trying to boost its profile on any number of issues , " laurenz meyer of the cdu 's parliamentary group gloated in an interview with the daily leipziger volkszeitung .
" the poll numbers are apparently taking their toll . "
the conservatives have used their advantage to go on the offensive on a range of issues , often catching the social democrats off guard .
guenther beckstein , the powerful conservative state interior minister in bavaria , infuriated social democrats when he said they would share the blame for a future terrorist attack in germany for opposing cdu plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen seems to have taken some pages from the spd 's book the parties have also reached an impasse on the spd 's call for a minimum wage in certain sectors .
the cdu argues it would be a job-killer .
and the conservative family affairs minister ursula von der leyen , a media-savvy mother of seven , has upstaged the social democrats with ambitious plans for expanding state-funded child care and family leave .
political paralysis " the spd is slowly realizing that the cdu / csu will not grant it any more major successes , " said the berlin daily tagesspiegel .
vice chancellor franz müntefering of the social democrats told public broadcaster zdf he was nevertheless confident the coalition would see out its four-year term , to 2009 .
" but we have to do better than we have done in recent weeks .
that 's for sure , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering recognizes that his party is losing the game as the social democrats cope with sinking poll ratings and the right-wing christian union parties dream of a future coalition with a smaller , less troublesome king-maker party , the result has been political paralysis in berlin .
" the cdu / csu and the spd are united by just one thought : when might be the right time to leave the coalition , citing a reason that could be made plausible ? " the center-left daily süddeutsche zeitung said .
" the hamburg -lrb- city-state -rrb- elections in february 2008 , just after a series of other state elections , are at the center of these considerations . "
despite the friction , few observers thought the government would fall .
" the coalition will not collapse now , but the aversion is growing , " the left-leaning daily frankfurter rundschau wrote . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top german politicians argue over measures to fight terrorism german politicians are at odds over a minister 's remark that the presumption of innocence does n't apply to suspected terrorists , as the cabinet on wednesday decided on new measures in the fight against terror .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .
new age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff practically brought the berlin wall down now , there is knut - berlin 's cuddly sensation , the polar bear who was rejected by his mother , but adopted by an entire city .
unlike jfk and david hasselhoff , knut did n't want to become a berliner .
his idea of fun involves fish and freezing cold showers , not jelly doughnuts and screaming children .
but he had no saying in the whole matter and he is now the most famous living berliner , an overnight celebrity , a symbol of the fight against global warming and the hairiest celebrity ever to make the cover of vanity fair .
a new website called youknut - in reference to the popular internet video sharing site youtube - has been set up as a place for kunt fans to share their stories , songs and video about their favorite berliner .
one user posted a poem called " knut , oh knut , " while another used the site to announce he was looking for the nice girl he had met on the subway who wore the youknut badge .

now , he is going into television . former germany boss jürgen klinsmann revealed on thursday he is set to return to coaching and will be spending the summer considering job offers - from both clubs and countries . despite german press reports on thursday stating klinsmann had effectively ruled himself out of coaching english premiership champions chelsea by taking a job with german tv , the 42-year old insists he wants to coach again . klinsmann will work as an analyst and commentator for pay-tv channel arena for the next two years and will fly to germany from his home in california for major bundesliga games . the arena network has confirmed that klinsmann will get his own show on a two-year contract starting next season .
the show will feature commentary and analysis around bundesliga matches and important games in foreign leagues . " i do n't see myself as the classic tv expert , " said klinsmann , " but rather as an observer who enjoys football as much as the fans do . " competing for the star coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi was no stranger to tv during his tenure as coach but the ex-german striker insists he is also ready to coach again after taking a break having led germany to third-place at last year 's world cup on home soil . " whatever happens , i want to get back into the coaching game .
we 'll have to see whether that happens sooner or later , " klinsmann said at a press conference organised by arena . he said he has told his new employers he may be taking up a coaching role in the future after receiving offers " from teams and from national federations . " " i made sure arena are aware of that , so if i accepted a coaching post , our collaboration can be suspended at any time , " specified klinsmann .
" there are a certain number of proposals from clubs and national federations on the table , i am going to wait until this summer to analyse and sort out the offers to make a decision . " klinsmann would not specify which jobs he is considering , but he has been tipped to succeed jose mourinho at chelsea . tired , emotional and burnt out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching took a lot out of klinsi - but he will be back and the former tottenham , inter milan and bayern munich forward explained why he stood down as german coach , saying he was " burned out " after two years in charge and needed to " recharge his batteries " . " it was necessary that i took a break after the world cup , it was difficult for my family .
during the last 10 months , i have enjoyed a normal family life and i also took time to assess the world cup . " klinsmann had also been in talks with the united states soccer federation last year over its bid to replace incumbent us coach bruce arena with the california-based german soccer hero .
but in december , klinsmann gave up on the idea when it became clear that he would have no control over team matters .
bob bradley is now the interim boss of the us-team as it searches for a permanent replacement . earlier this year , klinsmann had also been informally approached by the australian team , according to australian media reports .
klinsmann was reported to have discussed real estate but also football business with peter lowy , the son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy . although the tv contract has put his career as a football coach on hold for at least two years , the charismatic klinsi recently dropped a hint that he might be back for the world cup 2010 .
" who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said at a fifa conference in berlin . from underdog to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with a german national hero klinsmann became a national hero when he led the german team to third place in last year 's world cup .
but he stepped down as germany head coach four days after the tournament , saying it was time to move on . klinsmann , who lives with his wife and two children in california , said then that his " big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them . "
he added that " after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " his new job as a television commentator is bound to afford the legendary klinsmann a more comfortable daily routine . in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , klinsmann endured scathing criticism from the tabloid press and some of his colleagues in the business .
critics viewed klinsmann 's coaching strategy with contempt , as he recruited many younger players into the team and was known for his unorthodox training methods .
klinsmann was also chided for his decision to commute to germany from california . but germany 's strong showing in the world cup took most observers - including germany fans - by surprise and silenced even the most relentless critics .
klinsmann subsequently became known as the " golden bomber " for his blonde hair and aggressive playing tactics . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said when it was over .
" we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . "
for that achievement , klinsmann was awarded the medal of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- by the german government . as a player , klinsmann claimed a world cup title in 1990 , when germany beat argentina 1-0 , and went on to play for france , italy and england .
after a brief stint as a striker for california 's orange county blue star , klinsmann retired in 1998 and began his career as a coach . dw staff -lrb- ab / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .

bremen are the only non-spanish team left with osasuna meeting sevilla in the other semi . never before has spain managed to have three teams in the uefa semis , and the public interest in the competition is higher than ever , particularly since the proud football nation has no team left in the champions league .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.04.2007 german beekeepers fighting for the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bee populations have been devastated - the reason why is unclear bee populations in the us have dramatically dropped over the last six months .
german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .
here we almost look after every single colony . "
age factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honey as well as wax and royal jelly are products that come from beekeeping on the other hand , german apiary faces its own difficulties .
" beekeepers here tend to be loners , " said schricker , who has been studying bees since becoming a student of zoology in the 1960s .
" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .
politicians have n't realized the value of honey bees . "
age is also a major issue .
friedrich said federation members are , on average , 60 years old , while most of the people taking up the hobby also tend to be 40 and over .
the mobility required in today 's society makes it difficult to persuade young people to take up the hobby , she said .
" the age structure remains a problem , " friedrich said .
" the tendency is positive .
more women are joining .
up to now it has always tended to be a bit of a male domain .
but more beekeepers are dying than are taking up the hobby .
if we are to keep it alive , we need lots of new people . "
across the country , a whole variety of courses are on offer to introduce people all ages to beekeeping .
in bavaria , a leasing scheme has been launched to allow potential beekeepers to try out the pastime .
city bees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recruitment drive is on to find young beekeepers and although beekeeping has traditionally been very much a rural pastime that does not mean that city dwellers have to be excluded .
" even in berlin people keep bees , " schricker said .
" in allotments , on rooftop gardens and even on their balconies . "
a berlin bee has even been bred especially to suit urban conditions .
" it has certain characteristics such as docility and it is also attracted to blossom that you can find in the city - tree blossom mainly , " he said .
while people may not have to live in the country to become a beekeeper , a dollop of idealism helps .
the profits that can be made from selling hand-harvested honey tend to be limited .
" it 's a nice hobby , " schricker said .
" you also have to appreciate the social value too .
keeping bees is a very good way to react to climate change .
here on the ground it 's a way each one of us can do something for the future .

members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , who were present at a meeting of the committee on wednesday , reported fritsche ’ s comments to the press .
representatives from all political parties criticized the highly controversial practice as unlawful .
germany ’ s commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , told afp news service he thinks the practice is anti-constitutional , and said the matter would be looked into immediately .
meanwhile , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called for a change in the law for online computer monitoring .
spying allowed by schily the chancellor ’ s office said that in light of terrorism threats , examining pc hard drives is an " important intelligence tool . "
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far is too far ?
government spies have been accessing private data via the internet computer-monitoring by germany ’ s interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been possible since the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it , in june , 2005 .
according to the chancellor ’ s office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
social democratic interior committee chairman , sebastian edathy , told afp that schily ’ s regulations were " not a sustainable -lrb- legal -rrb- basis . "
the number of searches undertaken were only " in the single digits , " he said , but added that the parliament needed to give a " clear sign " that there are still insufficient legal grounds for carrying out such searches .
he also said he could imagine allowing such monitoring in particularly grievous cases , but then only under oversight of the court .
schäuble : ' let 's look at article 13 ' interior minister schäuble told parliament that online data searches should not be allowed without a legal foundation .
if the searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy , " then let ’ s think about whether we want to expand article 13 , " he said .
following the german federal court ’ s decision , schäuble had lobbied hard for a legal provision to allow police to do on-line searches .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are absolutely necessary , but they need a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
the social democrats reproached them that the statements were meant to imply the spd is opposed to online searches , although " they themselves started the searches . "
opposition is outspoken bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat schily signed work decrees on spying in 2005 green party interior expert silke stokar told afp news service that the " secret working decrees " acted to bypass parliament .
" it is simply anti-constitutional , " she said .
greens party chief claudia roth said both intelligence agencies , the bfv and bnd , clearly consider " civil rights and informational self-determination from the perspective of a wrecking company . "
max stadler , interior expert from the liberal fdp party , called for the german government to terminate the searches instantly .
" lawmakers should keep their hands off of online searches , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.04.2007 german beekeepers fighting for the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bee populations have been devastated - the reason why is unclear bee populations in the us have dramatically dropped over the last six months .
german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .
here we almost look after every single colony . "
age factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honey as well as wax and royal jelly are products that come from beekeeping on the other hand , german apiary faces its own difficulties .
" beekeepers here tend to be loners , " said schricker , who has been studying bees since becoming a student of zoology in the 1960s .
" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .
politicians have n't realized the value of honey bees . "
age is also a major issue .
friedrich said federation members are , on average , 60 years old , while most of the people taking up the hobby also tend to be 40 and over .
the mobility required in today 's society makes it difficult to persuade young people to take up the hobby , she said .
" the age structure remains a problem , " friedrich said .
" the tendency is positive .
more women are joining .
up to now it has always tended to be a bit of a male domain .
but more beekeepers are dying than are taking up the hobby .
if we are to keep it alive , we need lots of new people . "
across the country , a whole variety of courses are on offer to introduce people all ages to beekeeping .
in bavaria , a leasing scheme has been launched to allow potential beekeepers to try out the pastime .
city bees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recruitment drive is on to find young beekeepers and although beekeeping has traditionally been very much a rural pastime that does not mean that city dwellers have to be excluded .
" even in berlin people keep bees , " schricker said .
" in allotments , on rooftop gardens and even on their balconies . "
a berlin bee has even been bred especially to suit urban conditions .
" it has certain characteristics such as docility and it is also attracted to blossom that you can find in the city - tree blossom mainly , " he said .
while people may not have to live in the country to become a beekeeper , a dollop of idealism helps .
the profits that can be made from selling hand-harvested honey tend to be limited .
" it 's a nice hobby , " schricker said .
" you also have to appreciate the social value too .
keeping bees is a very good way to react to climate change .
here on the ground it 's a way each one of us can do something for the future .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .
new age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff practically brought the berlin wall down now , there is knut - berlin 's cuddly sensation , the polar bear who was rejected by his mother , but adopted by an entire city .
unlike jfk and david hasselhoff , knut did n't want to become a berliner .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .
new age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff practically brought the berlin wall down now , there is knut - berlin 's cuddly sensation , the polar bear who was rejected by his mother , but adopted by an entire city .
unlike jfk and david hasselhoff , knut did n't want to become a berliner .

bremen are the only non-spanish team left with osasuna meeting sevilla in the other semi . never before has spain managed to have three teams in the uefa semis , and the public interest in the competition is higher than ever , particularly since the proud football nation has no team left in the champions league .
understandably , there is even more media attention being paid to the osasuna-sevilla semi than to the espanyol-bremen tie .
but that 's just fine for werder 's opponents who are focused purely on getting a result at home and preventing the free-scoring germans from getting a vital away goal .
defender daniel jarque said on monday that " we have to stop them from scoring here . "
jarque added that " we really have to enjoy games like this , this is what we are footballers for . "
free-scoring werder a challenge for any team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espanyol midfielder moises hurtado , for his part , said on tuesday that " werder bremen are the big favourite to win the uefa cup ... they have an enormous offensive capacity and they are coming from the champions league . "
bremen were only narrowly eliminated in a tough champions league group with chelsea and barcelona .
boasting world cup top scorer miroslav klose and brazilian playmaker diego , bremen have overcome an early-spring slump and are in fine form again , on the heels of bundesliga leaders schalke and ready to deliver in the uefa cup as well .
" we are highly motivated .
every player dreams of these big matches .
we will do out utmost to claim both titles , in the league and in the uefa cup , " said diego .
klose said bremen has " no reason to hide " as the germans aim to take a first step towards preventing a final between two teams from one league which last came in 1998 when inter milan beat fellow- italians lazio .

sevilla coach juande ramos should have his entire squad available , given that andres palop , renato , adriano and frederic kanoute are all now fit and raring to go .
jose maria del nido , the ambitious president of sevilla , pointed out on monday , that his priority is to qualify for the champions league rather than retain the uefa cup or win the spanish king 's cup .
" the champions league is a strategic , sporting and economic objective which will permit us to increase our budget by about 30 per cent , " he claimed .
" the uefa cup and the king 's cup are important but our priority has to be getting in the champions league . "
sevilla are currently second in " la liga " , after thrashing athletic bilbao 4-1 on sunday .
osasuna 's only doubt concerns iranian international javad nekounam , who has been out since march 30 with a twisted knee .
midfielders francisco punal and ludovic delporte are both fit again after lengthy layoffs .
osasuna coach jose angel ziganda rested several key players in sunday 's 1-0 away to deportivo coruna , most notably enrique corrales , roberto soldado and savo milosevic .
osasuna defender carlos cuellar said on tuesday that sevilla are " a good team " but added that " we are certainly not afraid of them . "

german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .

beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .

" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .

age is also a major issue .
friedrich said federation members are , on average , 60 years old , while most of the people taking up the hobby also tend to be 40 and over .
the mobility required in today 's society makes it difficult to persuade young people to take up the hobby , she said .
" the age structure remains a problem , " friedrich said .
" the tendency is positive .
more women are joining .
up to now it has always tended to be a bit of a male domain .
but more beekeepers are dying than are taking up the hobby .
if we are to keep it alive , we need lots of new people . "
across the country , a whole variety of courses are on offer to introduce people all ages to beekeeping .
in bavaria , a leasing scheme has been launched to allow potential beekeepers to try out the pastime .
city bees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recruitment drive is on to find young beekeepers and although beekeeping has traditionally been very much a rural pastime that does not mean that city dwellers have to be excluded .

german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .
here we almost look after every single colony . "
age factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honey as well as wax and royal jelly are products that come from beekeeping on the other hand , german apiary faces its own difficulties .
" beekeepers here tend to be loners , " said schricker , who has been studying bees since becoming a student of zoology in the 1960s .
" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .

now the tense calm that had reigned in their nearly 18 months in power is history .
the spat between the long-time rivals came to a head when volker kauder , the christian democrats ' parliamentary group leader and a member of merkel 's inner circle , accused social democrats of grandstanding at germany 's expense .
" the spd is damaging the country , " he told news channel n24 after leading social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- went on the attack over conservative proposals to slash corporate taxes and eliminate the inheritance tax .
a member of the spd 's board , andreas nahles , shot back on rbb radio that it was " unbelievable " that the christian democrats would call for the tax cuts in direct violation of the government 's original coalition agreement .
merkel enjoys limelight during its tenure , the " grand coalition " - the product of an inconclusive national election - merkel has deftly set the agenda and quashed dissent , sending her approval ratings soaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been feted in europe and elsewhere at the same time , the german economy - europe 's largest - has made a robust recovery , joblessness is falling and the public deficit is shrinking .
merkel has also basked in the limelight of the dual presidencies of the european union and the group of eight club of wealthy nations that she assumed in january .
off their game at the same time , the social democrats have struggled to seize on issues that resonate with their rank-and-file members and appeal to centrist voters .
the party has plummeted to just 27 percent backing in opinion polls versus 34 percent for merkel 's conservatives .
" the spd is now futilely trying to boost its profile on any number of issues , " laurenz meyer of the cdu 's parliamentary group gloated in an interview with the daily leipziger volkszeitung .
" the poll numbers are apparently taking their toll . "
the conservatives have used their advantage to go on the offensive on a range of issues , often catching the social democrats off guard .
guenther beckstein , the powerful conservative state interior minister in bavaria , infuriated social democrats when he said they would share the blame for a future terrorist attack in germany for opposing cdu plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen seems to have taken some pages from the spd 's book the parties have also reached an impasse on the spd 's call for a minimum wage in certain sectors .
the cdu argues it would be a job-killer .
and the conservative family affairs minister ursula von der leyen , a media-savvy mother of seven , has upstaged the social democrats with ambitious plans for expanding state-funded child care and family leave .
political paralysis " the spd is slowly realizing that the cdu / csu will not grant it any more major successes , " said the berlin daily tagesspiegel .
vice chancellor franz müntefering of the social democrats told public broadcaster zdf he was nevertheless confident the coalition would see out its four-year term , to 2009 .
" but we have to do better than we have done in recent weeks .
that 's for sure , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering recognizes that his party is losing the game as the social democrats cope with sinking poll ratings and the right-wing christian union parties dream of a future coalition with a smaller , less troublesome king-maker party , the result has been political paralysis in berlin .
" the cdu / csu and the spd are united by just one thought : when might be the right time to leave the coalition , citing a reason that could be made plausible ? " the center-left daily süddeutsche zeitung said .
" the hamburg -lrb- city-state -rrb- elections in february 2008 , just after a series of other state elections , are at the center of these considerations . "
despite the friction , few observers thought the government would fall .

political paralysis " the spd is slowly realizing that the cdu / csu will not grant it any more major successes , " said the berlin daily tagesspiegel .

" the cdu / csu and the spd are united by just one thought : when might be the right time to leave the coalition , citing a reason that could be made plausible ? " the center-left daily süddeutsche zeitung said .
" the hamburg -lrb- city-state -rrb- elections in february 2008 , just after a series of other state elections , are at the center of these considerations . "
despite the friction , few observers thought the government would fall .

he added that " after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " his new job as a television commentator is bound to afford the legendary klinsmann a more comfortable daily routine . in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , klinsmann endured scathing criticism from the tabloid press and some of his colleagues in the business .
critics viewed klinsmann 's coaching strategy with contempt , as he recruited many younger players into the team and was known for his unorthodox training methods .
klinsmann was also chided for his decision to commute to germany from california . but germany 's strong showing in the world cup took most observers - including germany fans - by surprise and silenced even the most relentless critics .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi warplanes turned guernica into a landscape of pain and destruction the attack on april 26 , 1937 leveled three-quarters of the historic town , killing hundreds of the roughly 6,000 people which called it home at the time .
" in the panel on which i am working , which i shall call guernica , and in all my recent works of art , i clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk spain in an ocean of pain and death , " picasso was quoted as saying as he worked on the mural .
history of a painting today , marking the 70th anniversary of the attack by the nazi 's condor legion on the basque town , an exhibition at the wall museum in berlin entitled " pablo picasso .
guernica .
history of a painting " explores the genesis of a unique work that is considered by many as modern art 's most powerful anti-war symbol .
" picasso created a painting that is still very moving , " said director of the berlin wall museum alexandra hildebrandt .
" it does n't show airplanes or enemies .
it 's filled with dead and injured bodies .
it could 've carried the name of ' dresden ' or ' hiroshima . " '
" thanks to picasso 's famous painting , guernica 's name has not been forgotten , which is what happened to many other places with a similar destiny , " hildebrandt said .
the berlin exhibition , which opened on wednesday , has been set up by spanish book publisher and curator jacobo armero .
bildunterschrift : picasso 's " guernica " is a testimony to the power of art a symbol of national pride for many basques " guernica " is an important symbol of their national identity as the town is considered the centre of their cultural traditions .
the town was once home to an oak tree which spanish kings would stand beneath and vow to respect an ancient code giving the independent-minded basques special rights .
the tree survived the bombing but died during a heat wave in 2003 and was replaced two years later .
after franco won the civil war and established a dictatorship , picasso arranged for the museum of modern art -lrb- moma -rrb- in new york keep the painting for as long as he was in power .
during the vietnam war , the room housing " guernica " at the us museum became the site of occasional anti-war vigils .
franco died in 1975 - two years after picasso - and in 1981 the painting arrived in newly democratic spain where it was housed first in an annex of madrid 's prado museum before being moved to the reina sofia , which is named after spain 's current queen .
around the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people died in the bombing of guernica the mural , which is 3.5 metres -lrb- 11 feet -rrb- tall and 7.8 metres wide , was exhibited in more than 50 different palces around the world between 1937 and 1957 , including brazil , germany and the united states .
the frequent moves during this time damaged the painting and it is now very fragile , the head of the museum 's conservation department , jorge garcia , told afp last year .
" it is unthinkable to wrap it up again , anyone who desires this is crazy , " he said at the time .
the 70th anniversary of the bombing has also led to renewed calls for picasso 's painting to be put on display in the town .
museum directors and the central government in madrid turned down the request , saying the painting was to fragile to be moved .
basque government officials said they would now try to have the painting moved to guernica in time for the 75th anniversary of the attack . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin exhibition explores art and science of pain a new exhibition in berlin aims to explore the many facets of human pain .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi warplanes turned guernica into a landscape of pain and destruction the attack on april 26 , 1937 leveled three-quarters of the historic town , killing hundreds of the roughly 6,000 people which called it home at the time .
" in the panel on which i am working , which i shall call guernica , and in all my recent works of art , i clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk spain in an ocean of pain and death , " picasso was quoted as saying as he worked on the mural .
history of a painting today , marking the 70th anniversary of the attack by the nazi 's condor legion on the basque town , an exhibition at the wall museum in berlin entitled " pablo picasso .
guernica .
history of a painting " explores the genesis of a unique work that is considered by many as modern art 's most powerful anti-war symbol .
" picasso created a painting that is still very moving , " said director of the berlin wall museum alexandra hildebrandt .
" it does n't show airplanes or enemies .
it 's filled with dead and injured bodies .
it could 've carried the name of ' dresden ' or ' hiroshima . " '
" thanks to picasso 's famous painting , guernica 's name has not been forgotten , which is what happened to many other places with a similar destiny , " hildebrandt said .
the berlin exhibition , which opened on wednesday , has been set up by spanish book publisher and curator jacobo armero .
bildunterschrift : picasso 's " guernica " is a testimony to the power of art a symbol of national pride for many basques " guernica " is an important symbol of their national identity as the town is considered the centre of their cultural traditions .
the town was once home to an oak tree which spanish kings would stand beneath and vow to respect an ancient code giving the independent-minded basques special rights .
the tree survived the bombing but died during a heat wave in 2003 and was replaced two years later .
after franco won the civil war and established a dictatorship , picasso arranged for the museum of modern art -lrb- moma -rrb- in new york keep the painting for as long as he was in power .
during the vietnam war , the room housing " guernica " at the us museum became the site of occasional anti-war vigils .
franco died in 1975 - two years after picasso - and in 1981 the painting arrived in newly democratic spain where it was housed first in an annex of madrid 's prado museum before being moved to the reina sofia , which is named after spain 's current queen .
around the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people died in the bombing of guernica the mural , which is 3.5 metres -lrb- 11 feet -rrb- tall and 7.8 metres wide , was exhibited in more than 50 different palces around the world between 1937 and 1957 , including brazil , germany and the united states .
the frequent moves during this time damaged the painting and it is now very fragile , the head of the museum 's conservation department , jorge garcia , told afp last year .
" it is unthinkable to wrap it up again , anyone who desires this is crazy , " he said at the time .
the 70th anniversary of the bombing has also led to renewed calls for picasso 's painting to be put on display in the town .
museum directors and the central government in madrid turned down the request , saying the painting was to fragile to be moved .
basque government officials said they would now try to have the painting moved to guernica in time for the 75th anniversary of the attack . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin exhibition explores art and science of pain a new exhibition in berlin aims to explore the many facets of human pain .

now the tense calm that had reigned in their nearly 18 months in power is history .
the spat between the long-time rivals came to a head when volker kauder , the christian democrats ' parliamentary group leader and a member of merkel 's inner circle , accused social democrats of grandstanding at germany 's expense .
" the spd is damaging the country , " he told news channel n24 after leading social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- went on the attack over conservative proposals to slash corporate taxes and eliminate the inheritance tax .
a member of the spd 's board , andreas nahles , shot back on rbb radio that it was " unbelievable " that the christian democrats would call for the tax cuts in direct violation of the government 's original coalition agreement .
merkel enjoys limelight during its tenure , the " grand coalition " - the product of an inconclusive national election - merkel has deftly set the agenda and quashed dissent , sending her approval ratings soaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been feted in europe and elsewhere at the same time , the german economy - europe 's largest - has made a robust recovery , joblessness is falling and the public deficit is shrinking .
merkel has also basked in the limelight of the dual presidencies of the european union and the group of eight club of wealthy nations that she assumed in january .
off their game at the same time , the social democrats have struggled to seize on issues that resonate with their rank-and-file members and appeal to centrist voters .
the party has plummeted to just 27 percent backing in opinion polls versus 34 percent for merkel 's conservatives .
" the spd is now futilely trying to boost its profile on any number of issues , " laurenz meyer of the cdu 's parliamentary group gloated in an interview with the daily leipziger volkszeitung .
" the poll numbers are apparently taking their toll . "
the conservatives have used their advantage to go on the offensive on a range of issues , often catching the social democrats off guard .
guenther beckstein , the powerful conservative state interior minister in bavaria , infuriated social democrats when he said they would share the blame for a future terrorist attack in germany for opposing cdu plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen seems to have taken some pages from the spd 's book the parties have also reached an impasse on the spd 's call for a minimum wage in certain sectors .
the cdu argues it would be a job-killer .
and the conservative family affairs minister ursula von der leyen , a media-savvy mother of seven , has upstaged the social democrats with ambitious plans for expanding state-funded child care and family leave .
political paralysis " the spd is slowly realizing that the cdu / csu will not grant it any more major successes , " said the berlin daily tagesspiegel .
vice chancellor franz müntefering of the social democrats told public broadcaster zdf he was nevertheless confident the coalition would see out its four-year term , to 2009 .
" but we have to do better than we have done in recent weeks .
that 's for sure , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering recognizes that his party is losing the game as the social democrats cope with sinking poll ratings and the right-wing christian union parties dream of a future coalition with a smaller , less troublesome king-maker party , the result has been political paralysis in berlin .

a member of the spd 's board , andreas nahles , shot back on rbb radio that it was " unbelievable " that the christian democrats would call for the tax cuts in direct violation of the government 's original coalition agreement .
merkel enjoys limelight during its tenure , the " grand coalition " - the product of an inconclusive national election - merkel has deftly set the agenda and quashed dissent , sending her approval ratings soaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been feted in europe and elsewhere at the same time , the german economy - europe 's largest - has made a robust recovery , joblessness is falling and the public deficit is shrinking .
merkel has also basked in the limelight of the dual presidencies of the european union and the group of eight club of wealthy nations that she assumed in january .
off their game at the same time , the social democrats have struggled to seize on issues that resonate with their rank-and-file members and appeal to centrist voters .
the party has plummeted to just 27 percent backing in opinion polls versus 34 percent for merkel 's conservatives .
" the spd is now futilely trying to boost its profile on any number of issues , " laurenz meyer of the cdu 's parliamentary group gloated in an interview with the daily leipziger volkszeitung .
" the poll numbers are apparently taking their toll . "
the conservatives have used their advantage to go on the offensive on a range of issues , often catching the social democrats off guard .
guenther beckstein , the powerful conservative state interior minister in bavaria , infuriated social democrats when he said they would share the blame for a future terrorist attack in germany for opposing cdu plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen seems to have taken some pages from the spd 's book the parties have also reached an impasse on the spd 's call for a minimum wage in certain sectors .
the cdu argues it would be a job-killer .
and the conservative family affairs minister ursula von der leyen , a media-savvy mother of seven , has upstaged the social democrats with ambitious plans for expanding state-funded child care and family leave .
political paralysis " the spd is slowly realizing that the cdu / csu will not grant it any more major successes , " said the berlin daily tagesspiegel .
vice chancellor franz müntefering of the social democrats told public broadcaster zdf he was nevertheless confident the coalition would see out its four-year term , to 2009 .
" but we have to do better than we have done in recent weeks .
that 's for sure , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering recognizes that his party is losing the game as the social democrats cope with sinking poll ratings and the right-wing christian union parties dream of a future coalition with a smaller , less troublesome king-maker party , the result has been political paralysis in berlin .
" the cdu / csu and the spd are united by just one thought : when might be the right time to leave the coalition , citing a reason that could be made plausible ? " the center-left daily süddeutsche zeitung said .
" the hamburg -lrb- city-state -rrb- elections in february 2008 , just after a series of other state elections , are at the center of these considerations . "
despite the friction , few observers thought the government would fall .
" the coalition will not collapse now , but the aversion is growing , " the left-leaning daily frankfurter rundschau wrote . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top german politicians argue over measures to fight terrorism german politicians are at odds over a minister 's remark that the presumption of innocence does n't apply to suspected terrorists , as the cabinet on wednesday decided on new measures in the fight against terror .

kill knut ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he need a therapist when he grows up ?
knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .
he is no doubt up there with jfk and david hasselhoff in the berlin hall of fame .
but fame - as celebrities often like to point out - comes at a high price . three events in berlin 's rich and tumultuous history have left particular marks on its stature as a cosmopolitan city in the twentieth century .
first , there was that famous cold war-era speech in which youthful and dashing american president john fitzgerald kennedy almost broke his tongue calling himself a berliner - in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy in berlin - still a legend despite what some overzealous , self-proclaimed experts on german grammar wanted you to think for years , kennedy 's use of the indefinite article in " ich bin ein berliner " did not make him sound as a weirdo who thought he was a jelly doughnut .
the truth of the matter is that in 1963 , berliners found kennedy 's american accent charming .
they felt his statement was a powerful message of support for the city painfully lacerated by a wall .
then , there was former baywatch chief lifeguard david hasselhof , who in 1989 - the year in which the berlin wall finally fell - said that he felt " a bit sad " that he did n't find his picture hanging on the walls of the museum at checkpoint charlie .
after all , the us actor said his song " looking for freedom " - which was , indeed , a big hit in germany and which he got to sing on top of the crumbling wall - helped unite the country .
everybody - even the man who saved lives with curvaceous pamela anderson - wants to be a berliner .
new age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff practically brought the berlin wall down now , there is knut - berlin 's cuddly sensation , the polar bear who was rejected by his mother , but adopted by an entire city .
unlike jfk and david hasselhoff , knut did n't want to become a berliner .
his idea of fun involves fish and freezing cold showers , not jelly doughnuts and screaming children .
but he had no saying in the whole matter and he is now the most famous living berliner , an overnight celebrity , a symbol of the fight against global warming and the hairiest celebrity ever to make the cover of vanity fair .
a new website called youknut - in reference to the popular internet video sharing site youtube - has been set up as a place for kunt fans to share their stories , songs and video about their favorite berliner .
one user posted a poem called " knut , oh knut , " while another used the site to announce he was looking for the nice girl he had met on the subway who wore the youknut badge .
and the cynics thought that there was no place for poetry or love in today 's world ?
the dark side of fame real celebrities always polarize .

the choice is yours .
if you are a hormonally imbalanced teenager or a disturbed person with unresolved aggression issues , you will try to shoot as many polar bears as possible .

for each polar bear shot or fed , you get one point .

now , he is going into television . former germany boss jürgen klinsmann revealed on thursday he is set to return to coaching and will be spending the summer considering job offers - from both clubs and countries . despite german press reports on thursday stating klinsmann had effectively ruled himself out of coaching english premiership champions chelsea by taking a job with german tv , the 42-year old insists he wants to coach again . klinsmann will work as an analyst and commentator for pay-tv channel arena for the next two years and will fly to germany from his home in california for major bundesliga games . the arena network has confirmed that klinsmann will get his own show on a two-year contract starting next season .
the show will feature commentary and analysis around bundesliga matches and important games in foreign leagues . " i do n't see myself as the classic tv expert , " said klinsmann , " but rather as an observer who enjoys football as much as the fans do . " competing for the star coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi was no stranger to tv during his tenure as coach but the ex-german striker insists he is also ready to coach again after taking a break having led germany to third-place at last year 's world cup on home soil . " whatever happens , i want to get back into the coaching game .
we 'll have to see whether that happens sooner or later , " klinsmann said at a press conference organised by arena . he said he has told his new employers he may be taking up a coaching role in the future after receiving offers " from teams and from national federations . " " i made sure arena are aware of that , so if i accepted a coaching post , our collaboration can be suspended at any time , " specified klinsmann .
" there are a certain number of proposals from clubs and national federations on the table , i am going to wait until this summer to analyse and sort out the offers to make a decision . " klinsmann would not specify which jobs he is considering , but he has been tipped to succeed jose mourinho at chelsea . tired , emotional and burnt out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching took a lot out of klinsi - but he will be back and the former tottenham , inter milan and bayern munich forward explained why he stood down as german coach , saying he was " burned out " after two years in charge and needed to " recharge his batteries " . " it was necessary that i took a break after the world cup , it was difficult for my family .
during the last 10 months , i have enjoyed a normal family life and i also took time to assess the world cup . " klinsmann had also been in talks with the united states soccer federation last year over its bid to replace incumbent us coach bruce arena with the california-based german soccer hero .
but in december , klinsmann gave up on the idea when it became clear that he would have no control over team matters .
bob bradley is now the interim boss of the us-team as it searches for a permanent replacement . earlier this year , klinsmann had also been informally approached by the australian team , according to australian media reports .
klinsmann was reported to have discussed real estate but also football business with peter lowy , the son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy . although the tv contract has put his career as a football coach on hold for at least two years , the charismatic klinsi recently dropped a hint that he might be back for the world cup 2010 .
" who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said at a fifa conference in berlin . from underdog to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with a german national hero klinsmann became a national hero when he led the german team to third place in last year 's world cup .
but he stepped down as germany head coach four days after the tournament , saying it was time to move on . klinsmann , who lives with his wife and two children in california , said then that his " big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them . "
he added that " after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " his new job as a television commentator is bound to afford the legendary klinsmann a more comfortable daily routine . in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , klinsmann endured scathing criticism from the tabloid press and some of his colleagues in the business .
critics viewed klinsmann 's coaching strategy with contempt , as he recruited many younger players into the team and was known for his unorthodox training methods .
klinsmann was also chided for his decision to commute to germany from california . but germany 's strong showing in the world cup took most observers - including germany fans - by surprise and silenced even the most relentless critics .
klinsmann subsequently became known as the " golden bomber " for his blonde hair and aggressive playing tactics . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said when it was over .
" we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . "
for that achievement , klinsmann was awarded the medal of merit -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- by the german government . as a player , klinsmann claimed a world cup title in 1990 , when germany beat argentina 1-0 , and went on to play for france , italy and england .
after a brief stint as a striker for california 's orange county blue star , klinsmann retired in 1998 and began his career as a coach . dw staff -lrb- ab / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .

german beekeepers have also faced losses in recent years .
but here fears are greater that the tradition of beekeeping could face extinction . no one knows the exact reason for the us crisis , which has led to more than a quarter of the country 's bee colonies being wiped out .
losses of a similar proportion were reported in germany four years ago and a monitoring system was set up in an ongoing attempt to find an answer to the mystery .
this year , burkhard schricker , from the free university in berlin , said reported deaths were on average under 10 percent .
" in germany that is quite normal , " he said .
" the situation has been exaggerated . "
the panic inspired by these reports reflects , however , the importance of the honey bee .
in germany alone , the agricultural value of the pollination work done by bees amounts to some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.41 billion -rrb- , according to schricker .
" the honeybee is , after cows and pigs , the third most important animal in agricultural terms , " he said .
invaluable workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to pollination , they 're really the bees knees environmentally , the insects ' work is invaluable .
" they also pollinate wild plants , " schricker said .
" if that did n't happen any more there would be soil erosion and no feed more for our animals .
in just a few years the landscape would n't be green anymore , but brown . "
beekeepers here in germany have been facing problems since the 1980s when the varroa mite , one possible contributing fact to the " colony collapse disorder " reported in the us , was inadvertently introduced .
the parasites suck on the bees ' larvae and weaken their immune system , spreading parasites into the bargain .
this has resulted in the re-emergence of diseases that disappeared long ago .
pesticides and antibiotics used to treat feedstuffs and agricultural products also threaten bee colonies .
the danger posed by gm crops still has yet to be determined .
labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping can be a time consuming , but extremely rewarding hobby unlike in the united states , beekeeping in germany often tends to be a labor of love .
petra friedrich of the german beekeepers ' federation said her organization has some 81,000 members on its books - all of them small-scale or hobby beekeepers with an average of nine bee colonies per member .
only some 500 to 600 professional beekeepers exist in germany as a whole , despite the national love of honey .
only 20 percent of the honey consumed here is also domestically produced .
the nature of beekeeping in germany has helped keep the lid on some of the problems , schricker said .
" in america they are all professional beekeepers who move around with their bees and make money by pollinating crops , " he added .
" they are not as concerned with the wellbeing of their bees .
that is there is not the same degree of care and supervision .
here we almost look after every single colony . "
age factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honey as well as wax and royal jelly are products that come from beekeeping on the other hand , german apiary faces its own difficulties .
" beekeepers here tend to be loners , " said schricker , who has been studying bees since becoming a student of zoology in the 1960s .
" that means they do n't have such a strong lobby .
there is n't really any public funding .
politicians have n't realized the value of honey bees . "
age is also a major issue .
friedrich said federation members are , on average , 60 years old , while most of the people taking up the hobby also tend to be 40 and over .
the mobility required in today 's society makes it difficult to persuade young people to take up the hobby , she said .
" the age structure remains a problem , " friedrich said .
" the tendency is positive .
more women are joining .
up to now it has always tended to be a bit of a male domain .
but more beekeepers are dying than are taking up the hobby .
if we are to keep it alive , we need lots of new people . "
across the country , a whole variety of courses are on offer to introduce people all ages to beekeeping .
in bavaria , a leasing scheme has been launched to allow potential beekeepers to try out the pastime .
city bees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recruitment drive is on to find young beekeepers and although beekeeping has traditionally been very much a rural pastime that does not mean that city dwellers have to be excluded .
" even in berlin people keep bees , " schricker said .
" in allotments , on rooftop gardens and even on their balconies . "
a berlin bee has even been bred especially to suit urban conditions .
" it has certain characteristics such as docility and it is also attracted to blossom that you can find in the city - tree blossom mainly , " he said .
while people may not have to live in the country to become a beekeeper , a dollop of idealism helps .
the profits that can be made from selling hand-harvested honey tend to be limited .
" it 's a nice hobby , " schricker said .
" you also have to appreciate the social value too .
keeping bees is a very good way to react to climate change .

one would n't mind being crooner neil diamond , a couple could imagine being scandinavian , and another had an embarrassing moment with shaving foam .
as the assembly election looms , we asked the four main party leaders the questions they have never faced before .
welcome to the hidden worlds of rhodri morgan , ieuan wyn jones , mike german and nick bourne .
enter with caution ...
here are the answers to 10 probing , impertinent and quite possibly daft inquiries from mr german , the leader of the liberal democrats in the assembly , and mr bourne , his conservative counterpart .
and in 24 hours we will shine a light into the unseen hinterland of welsh labour leader rhodri morgan and plaid cymru leader ieuan wyn jones .
come back if you dare ...
mike german , liberal democrat mike german 's pupils missed their ferry when he slept in 1 .
in which period of your life were you happiest and why ?
when i was at school - but i did n't know it then ! 2 .
which film role would you most be most comfortable in ?
eric porter 's role in the day of the jackal .
he played colonel rodin , who hunted down edward fox 's character -lrb- the jackal -rrb- , saving de gaulle and hopes for algerian independence .
3 .
what music do you play to get in a good mood ?
abba .
i do n't know anyone who does n't smile when they hear songs like super trouper or dancing queen .
4 .
who would you be in stars in their eyes ?
i would be the compere , i think .
5 .
what is the most embarrassing thing you 've ever done or said ?
when i was a teacher , i organised a 53-seat coach to take pupils to france for three days on an early ferry .
the coach turned up with 52 people on board outside my house , as i had slept in .
as we arrived in portsmouth , we could see the boat leaving its berth .
mike german could imagine taking on danish nationality 6 .
if you left politics tomorrow - what would be your alternative career ? -lrb- no previous careers allowed ! -rrb-
a stage manager .
7 .
if you had to be another nationality , what would you like to be , and why ?
danish .
the social values and quality of life have produced a very harmonious small nation .
8 .
what hidden talent do you have that might surprise us ?
i am an expert map reader .
9 .
what are you really bad at ?
stopping work .
10 .
what non-political aspect of modern life really irritates you ?
bad manners .
nick bourne , conservative nick bourne had a hugh grant-style embarrassing moment at a wedding 1 .
in which period of your life were you happiest and why ?
i am fortunate to always have been generally happy .
i think it would be invidious to single out any particular time .
i am very happy at the moment in the assembly doing a job that i enjoy .
2 .
which film role would you be most comfortable in ?
some people in the conservative party would probably cast me as don corleone in the godfather , but i would much prefer the part of atticus finch played by gregory peck in to kill a mockingbird .
3 .
what music do you please to get in a good mood ?
john denver .
4 .
who would you be in stars in their eyes ?
i do n't think i would be much good in stars in their eyes , but possibly neil diamond .
5 .
what is the most embarrassing thing you 've ever done or said ?
it was very embarrassing at a friend 's wedding when i went up and spoke to the bride , loudly addressing her in the name of his former long-term girlfriend .
nick bourne prefers the atticus finch -lrb- l -rrb- model to don corleone 6 .
if you left politics tomorrow what would be your alternative career -lrb- no previous careers allowed -rrb- ?
i have always greatly envied michael palin 's present career of travelling around the world to exotic and sometimes outlandish destinations and being paid , and have greatly enjoyed programmes like around the world in 80 days , pole to pole and sahara .
7 .
if you had to be another nationality what would you like to be and why ?
i have always had a great liking for france and , perhaps curiously for a brit , greatly like the french .
from an early age i used to go to france to stay with my french pen friend , i am still in touch with her even now , and i love holidaying in france - a country with all those wines and cheeses certainly ca n't be all bad ! 8 .
what hidden talent do you have that might surprise us ?
hard to know whether it would surprise people , but i have won cups for playing badminton in the dim and distant past .
9 .
what are you really bad at ?
queuing .
10 .
what non-political aspect of modern life really irritates you ?
telephone lines of large organisations -lrb- whether in the public or private sector -rrb- where the customer / client is deemed to be far less important than the organisation and kept waiting for ages and ages listening to vivaldi 's four seasons or beethoven 's pastoral symphony .

the hub would collect energy from wave turbines off st ives bay and meet 3 % of cornwall 's electricity needs .
the regional development agency -lrb- rda -rrb- which supplied the final funding said it would make the south west a world leader in wave energy technology .
the hub could be built in 2008 if ministers give it planning permission .
power from up to 40 floating wave energy devices located 10 miles -lrb- 16km -rrb- off st ives bay would come ashore via a 15-mile -lrb- 24km -rrb- cable to a new national grid sub station .
surfing risk the plans are now subject to final government and european union approval .
nick harrington , of the rda , described the funding as a major step forward .
" it 's not the last decision to be made , but it does demonstrate the rda itself now feels the project is far enough developed that it can give its seal of approval to it going ahead , " he told bbc news .
the project is expected to generate £ 76m over 25 years for the regional economy , and create at least 170 jobs .
mr harrington said : " from our point of view , this is about creating a new industry .
" you know , cornwall sadly needs new industry to compensate for the loss of mining over the last few decades and it is an opportunity to use the resources off the coast to really establish a position for cornwall right at the start of a new industry . "
three wave device developers have been chosen to work with the south west rda on the project .
bwea , the trade association representing the wind , wave and tidal energy industries , backed the project , saying it was crucial for the success of wave energy development .
some surfers are worried the wave devices could take energy from the waves and reduce wave heights by up to 10 % , putting the surfing industry in cornwall at risk .
but the environmental campaign group , surfers against sewage , said it supported the project .

the hub would collect energy from wave turbines off st ives bay and meet 3 % of cornwall 's electricity needs .
the regional development agency -lrb- rda -rrb- which supplied the final funding said it would make the south west a world leader in wave energy technology .
the hub could be built in 2008 if ministers give it planning permission .
power from up to 40 floating wave energy devices located 10 miles -lrb- 16km -rrb- off st ives bay would come ashore via a 15-mile -lrb- 24km -rrb- cable to a new national grid sub station .

nick harrington , of the rda , described the funding as a major step forward .
" it 's not the last decision to be made , but it does demonstrate the rda itself now feels the project is far enough developed that it can give its seal of approval to it going ahead , " he told bbc news .
the project is expected to generate £ 76m over 25 years for the regional economy , and create at least 170 jobs .
power would be collected from floating wave energy devices mr harrington said : " from our point of view , this is about creating a new industry .
" you know , cornwall sadly needs new industry to compensate for the loss of mining over the last few decades and it is an opportunity to use the resources off the coast to really establish a position for cornwall right at the start of a new industry . "
three wave device developers have been chosen to work with the south west rda on the project .

the hub would collect energy from wave turbines off st ives bay and meet 3 % of cornwall 's electricity needs .
the regional development agency -lrb- rda -rrb- which supplied the final funding said it would make the south west a world leader in wave energy technology .
the hub could be built in 2008 if ministers give it planning permission .
power from up to 40 floating wave energy devices located 10 miles -lrb- 16km -rrb- off st ives bay would come ashore via a 15-mile -lrb- 24km -rrb- cable to a new national grid sub station .
surfing risk the plans are now subject to final government and european union approval .
nick harrington , of the rda , described the funding as a major step forward .
" it 's not the last decision to be made , but it does demonstrate the rda itself now feels the project is far enough developed that it can give its seal of approval to it going ahead , " he told bbc news .
the project is expected to generate £ 76m over 25 years for the regional economy , and create at least 170 jobs .
power would be collected from floating wave energy devices mr harrington said : " from our point of view , this is about creating a new industry .
" you know , cornwall sadly needs new industry to compensate for the loss of mining over the last few decades and it is an opportunity to use the resources off the coast to really establish a position for cornwall right at the start of a new industry . "
three wave device developers have been chosen to work with the south west rda on the project .
bwea , the trade association representing the wind , wave and tidal energy industries , backed the project , saying it was crucial for the success of wave energy development .

he is expected to discuss strengthening bilateral ties and co-operation over north korea during talks with president george w bush at camp david on friday .
mr abe broke with tradition when he became prime minister in september , by visiting china and south korea before the us , japan 's closest ally .
his trip follows a furore over his recent comments on wwii sex slaves .
mr abe provoked an angry reaction in march after questioning whether there was any proof that the japanese military kidnapped women to work as sex slaves during the war .
i will express my stance with an iron will of seeking a solution to the abduction issue prime minister shinzo abe he has since stated several times that he stands by an official 1993 statement in which japan acknowledged the imperial army set up and ran brothels for its wartime troops .
but he has expressed his opposition to a resolution currently going through the us congress , which calls on japan to make a formal apology over the use of so-called comfort women .
mr abe was expected to be greeted in washington by protesters over the issue - a rare sight for visiting japanese leaders to the us , kyodo news agency reports .
' iron will ' before leaving for the us , mr abe said he hoped to build a relationship with mr bush " in which we can discuss everything frankly " .
" the japan-us alliance is the cornerstone of japan 's diplomacy and national security and as unshakable , irreplaceable allies , we need to build a firm relationship of trust , " he told reporters .

he said he would discuss the need to " find a solution to the issues of nuclear arms , missiles and abductions " in co-operation with other nations .
" i will express my stance with an iron will of seeking a solution to the abduction issue , " he went on .
high on the agenda will also be the two countries ' military relationship , as well as climate change , iraq and japan 's decision to ease restrictions on us beef imports .
correspondents say mr abe 's visit will be subdued in comparison to that of his flamboyant predecessor junichiro koizumi , who had a close relationship with mr bush .
on mr koizumi 's last visit before leaving office , he wowed americans with an elvis presley impersonation on a sideline visit to graceland .
mr abe chose to broaden japanese diplomacy when he took office , by breaking with a tradition that the new japanese prime minister 's first overseas visit be to washington .
instead , he went to china and south korea in a bid to ease strained ties .
he met mr bush for the first time in november , on the sidelines of a pacific rim summit in vietnam .
mr abe 's visit to the us will also include a trip to the arlington national cemetery and dinner at the white house before he leaves for a five-nation tour of the middle east .

big name stars will also be in the spotlight during the 12-day festival , during which more than 150 films will be screened .
former vice president al gore launched the event in new york , introducing seven shorts on climate change put together by a number of well-known directors .
bristol-based aardman animation has made one of them - and there are also contributions from two british directors , jonathan glazer and kevin macdonald .
the films can be seen as a rebuke to what many bush administration critics claim is the us president 's intransigence when it comes to effectively addressing global warming .
in addition to climate change , there are films that focus on iraq , the us treatment of prisoners in afghanistan and guantanamo bay . "
we are a festival that started because of an act of war " jane rosenthal tribeca 's co-founders , robert de niro and jane rosenthal , say the festival 's commitment to political films is connected to its origins - founded in the wake of the 11 september attacks which devastated the local neighbourhood .
" we are a festival that started because of an act of war , " says rosenthal , adding that " film-makers can sometimes break through with a message and point of view that politicians ca n't " .
de niro remembers the dark days following 11 september 2001 , when he felt that a film festival was the only way to revitalise the neighbourhood where he lived .
the actor and director says : " it was grim - we had always talked about doing a festival , and just kicked it around , and somehow this seemed obviously the right time to do it - and that was it , we just jumped in . "
but he does n't want the festival to be seen as just a political showcase .
" it 's political and it 's a lot of things , " says de niro , who hopes it will be " all things to all people " .
" i know it 's impossible , but that 's what we 're trying - and some things will work and some things wo n't , " he adds .
the festival aims to be a celebration of music and culture , with special events including street fairs and drive-in movie screenings .
this year , for the first time , there is also a series of sports films .
with al gore hosting the opening night gala , there may have been a groan from his critics who view it as a cynical effort to use an entertainment-related event to advance a political agenda .
but at tribeca , gore certainly has more supporters than detractors . "
i 'm not a figurehead .
i feel very strongly about everything , and so in that way i 'm very much part of it " robert de niro on his tribeca role " climate change is such a huge issue that you sometimes feel overwhelmed by it , " says rosenthal .
" the good news is that with all of these films , it gives you a good message about what you can do as an individual and what we can do to really change the world around us . "
in its first five years the tribeca festival has become a sprawling celebration , with screening venues in some cases several miles from its ground zero origins .
in the past there were complaints that there were too many films - and many journalists covering the festival found it lacked focus .
this year there has been a modest reduction in screenings .
the films being presented run the gamut from edgy indie works and obscure non-english language pictures to mass-market populist fare .
the festival is even participating in a citywide promotional spider-man 3 week .
tobey maguire and kirsten dunst will arrive in new york for the film 's us premiere , following an eight city international publicity tour .
although tribeca purists want to make sure the festival is n't hijacked by hollywood , de niro does n't see the spider-man hoopla as a bad thing .
" spider-man helps raise awareness and helps the attention that the festival gets , so that 's the good thing about it , " he says .
de niro enjoys a lot of respect for getting the festival off the ground and giving it momentum .
questions have been raised over whether he is doing more than just lending his name , but he maintains that he works closely with rosenthal .
" i 'm there .
i 'm not a figurehead .
i feel very strongly about everything , and so in that way i 'm very much part of it . "
since 2002 , the festival has attracted over one and a half million visitors and pumped more than $ 325m into the local economy .
on helping to revive the neighbourhood few would challenge the claim that the festival has had a positive impact .
many see the event growing in status on the world calendar .
while it still may be eclipsed by cannes , venice , berlin , london , sundance and toronto , many industry professionals have praised the festival 's commitment to world cinema .

big name stars will also be in the spotlight during the 12-day festival , during which more than 150 films will be screened .
former vice president al gore launched the event in new york , introducing seven shorts on climate change put together by a number of well-known directors .
bristol-based aardman animation has made one of them - and there are also contributions from two british directors , jonathan glazer and kevin macdonald .
the films can be seen as a rebuke to what many bush administration critics claim is the us president 's intransigence when it comes to effectively addressing global warming .
in addition to climate change , there are films that focus on iraq , the us treatment of prisoners in afghanistan and guantanamo bay .
we are a festival that started because of an act of war jane rosenthal tribeca 's co-founders , robert de niro and jane rosenthal , say the festival 's commitment to political films is connected to its origins - founded in the wake of the 11 september attacks which devastated the local neighbourhood .
" we are a festival that started because of an act of war , " says rosenthal , adding that " film-makers can sometimes break through with a message and point of view that politicians ca n't " .
de niro remembers the dark days following 11 september 2001 , when he felt that a film festival was the only way to revitalise the neighbourhood where he lived .
the actor and director says : " it was grim - we had always talked about doing a festival , and just kicked it around , and somehow this seemed obviously the right time to do it - and that was it , we just jumped in . "
gore 's an inconvenient truth won best documentary at the oscars but he does n't want the festival to be seen as just a political showcase .
" it 's political and it 's a lot of things , " says de niro , who hopes it will be " all things to all people " .
" i know it 's impossible , but that 's what we 're trying - and some things will work and some things wo n't , " he adds .
the festival aims to be a celebration of music and culture , with special events including street fairs and drive-in movie screenings .
this year , for the first time , there is also a series of sports films .
with al gore hosting the opening night gala , there may have been a groan from his critics who view it as a cynical effort to use an entertainment-related event to advance a political agenda .
but at tribeca , gore certainly has more supporters than detractors .
i 'm not a figurehead .
i feel very strongly about everything , and so in that way i 'm very much part of it robert de niro on his tribeca role " climate change is such a huge issue that you sometimes feel overwhelmed by it , " says rosenthal .
" the good news is that with all of these films , it gives you a good message about what you can do as an individual and what we can do to really change the world around us . "
in its first five years the tribeca festival has become a sprawling celebration , with screening venues in some cases several miles from its ground zero origins .
in the past there were complaints that there were too many films - and many journalists covering the festival found it lacked focus .
this year there has been a modest reduction in screenings .
the films being presented run the gamut from edgy indie works and obscure non-english language pictures to mass-market populist fare .
the festival is even participating in a citywide promotional spider-man 3 week .
tobey maguire and kirsten dunst will arrive in new york for the film 's us premiere , following an eight city international publicity tour .
tobey maguire reprises the superhero role in spider-man 3 although tribeca purists want to make sure the festival is n't hijacked by hollywood , de niro does n't see the spider-man hoopla as a bad thing .
" spider-man helps raise awareness and helps the attention that the festival gets , so that 's the good thing about it , " he says .
de niro enjoys a lot of respect for getting the festival off the ground and giving it momentum .
questions have been raised over whether he is doing more than just lending his name , but he maintains that he works closely with rosenthal .
" i 'm there .
i 'm not a figurehead .
i feel very strongly about everything , and so in that way i 'm very much part of it . "
since 2002 , the festival has attracted over one and a half million visitors and pumped more than $ 325m into the local economy .
on helping to revive the neighbourhood few would challenge the claim that the festival has had a positive impact .
many see the event growing in status on the world calendar .
while it still may be eclipsed by cannes , venice , berlin , london , sundance and toronto , many industry professionals have praised the festival 's commitment to world cinema .

the world 's second-largest maker of nand flash chips , it made a net profit of 137.4bn yen -lrb- £ 576.7m ; $ 1.16bn -rrb- for the year to march 2007 .
although the price of the chips fell 60 % , their strong sales compensated .
toshiba said it also benefited from good profit growth in its other units , such as power plant group westinghouse .
' further price cuts ' total sales at the japanese firm , which also makes televisions and household appliances rose 12.2 % to 7.12 trillion yen .
toshiba predicted that for the present year , net profit will fall 17.4 % partly because of consolidation at westinghouse , which it bought from british nuclear fuel .
the price of nand flash chips have fallen due to intense competition in the sector .
toshiba estimates prices will fall another 50 % this year .

they say it is a victory for the rights of ordinary bangladeshis .
on wednesday the government lifted restrictions on former prime ministers and bitter rivals , khaleda zia and sheikh hasina .
the restrictions were part of sweeping measures the government said were needed to fight corruption .
sheikh hasina , the leader of the awami league was no longer banned from returning from abroad , a government statement said .
" my gratitude to the people of bangladesh , the world media , world leaders and the friends of bangladesh .
everybody put pressure on the government , and because of that pressure they have withdrawn the ban , " she told the bbc 's world today programme .
the government also said there were no restrictions on the movements of khaleda zia , head of the bangladesh nationalist party -lrb- bnp -rrb- , who has been held under virtual house arrest in dhaka .
she has reportedly been under pressure to go into exile in saudi arabia .
' rights reasserted ' " it 's a people 's victory , " the bnp 's hannan shah said , reuters news agency reports .
the awami league 's general secretary , abdul jalil said : " it has been reasserted that people 's democratic and fundamental rights can not be robbed . "
the interim government 's u-turn has also been broadly welcomed in the press .
wednesday 's statement said that the government 's efforts to stop sheikh hasina from returning to bangladesh were being lifted " in view of the views expressed in the media and different quarters " .
sheikh hasina was prevented from flying back to dhaka on sunday .
she still faces murder charges after awami league members allegedly killed members of a rival political party during protests in dhaka last year against the caretaker government prior to the imposition of a state of emergency .
the statement made no reference to comments by the us state department earlier on wednesday that democracy in bangladesh was under threat .
" if the caretaker government does not take right decisions , there is a real threat to bangladesh democracy and nobody wants to see that , " spokesman sean mccormack said .
the government 's statement went on to say that - contrary to media reports - there had never been any pressure on bangladesh nationalist party -lrb- bnp -rrb- leader khaleda zia to leave the country , and there were no restrictions on her freedom of movement .
it is not clear whether wednesday 's announcement means that the two women will be free to resume their political careers and take part in elections which the government says will be held as soon as corruption in the country has been eradicated .
khaleda zia 's family said last week that they had been told to prepare for imminent exile in saudi arabia , but the saudi arabian government reportedly declined to allow her into the kingdom - apparently because it was reluctant to take in an unwilling guest .
attempts by the government to find another country for her to be exiled seem to have failed .
' clout ' khaleda zia 's son , tareque rahman , is one of around 160 politicians , businessmen and civil servants who have been arrested by the military-backed caretaker government on corruption charges .
the drive against corruption seems to have been welcomed by many ordinary bangladeshis tired of seeing politicians and their relatives siphoning off the country 's wealth .
the bbc 's john sudworth in dhaka says that after days of political manoeuvring with the intention of sending the country 's two most powerful political leaders into exile , the emergency government has seemingly backed down .
he says that the government seems to have badly misjudged the mood of the people .
it has argued that reform of the political system would be impossible while the two former prime ministers are still on the scene .
our correspondent says the two women seem to have won this particular battle with the government - which is perhaps a sign of just how much political clout they still wield .

the two main opposition parties in bangladesh have welcomed the interim government 's decision not to force their leaders into exile .
they say it is a victory for the rights of ordinary bangladeshis .
on wednesday the government lifted restrictions on former prime ministers and bitter rivals , khaleda zia and sheikh hasina .
the restrictions were part of sweeping measures the government said were needed to fight corruption .
sheikh hasina , the leader of the awami league was no longer banned from returning from abroad , a government statement said .
" my gratitude to the people of bangladesh , the world media , world leaders and the friends of bangladesh .
everybody put pressure on the government , and because of that pressure they have withdrawn the ban , " she told the bbc 's world today programme .
the government also said there were no restrictions on the movements of khaleda zia , head of the bangladesh nationalist party -lrb- bnp -rrb- , who has been held under virtual house arrest in dhaka .
she has reportedly been under pressure to go into exile in saudi arabia .
' rights reasserted ' " it 's a people 's victory , " the bnp 's hannan shah said , reuters news agency reports .
the military-backed government says it wants an end to corruption the awami league 's general secretary , abdul jalil said : " it has been reasserted that people 's democratic and fundamental rights can not be robbed . "
the interim government 's u-turn has also been broadly welcomed in the press .
wednesday 's statement said that the government 's efforts to stop sheikh hasina from returning to bangladesh were being lifted " in view of the views expressed in the media and different quarters " .
sheikh hasina was prevented from flying back to dhaka on sunday .
she still faces murder charges after awami league members allegedly killed members of a rival political party during protests in dhaka last year against the caretaker government prior to the imposition of a state of emergency .
the statement made no reference to comments by the us state department earlier on wednesday that democracy in bangladesh was under threat .
" if the caretaker government does not take right decisions , there is a real threat to bangladesh democracy and nobody wants to see that , " spokesman sean mccormack said .
sheikh hasina says the murder charges are baseless the government 's statement went on to say that - contrary to media reports - there had never been any pressure on bangladesh nationalist party -lrb- bnp -rrb- leader khaleda zia to leave the country , and there were no restrictions on her freedom of movement .
it is not clear whether wednesday 's announcement means that the two women will be free to resume their political careers and take part in elections which the government says will be held as soon as corruption in the country has been eradicated .
khaleda zia 's family said last week that they had been told to prepare for imminent exile in saudi arabia , but the saudi arabian government reportedly declined to allow her into the kingdom - apparently because it was reluctant to take in an unwilling guest .
attempts by the government to find another country for her to be exiled seem to have failed .
' clout ' khaleda zia 's son , tareque rahman , is one of around 160 politicians , businessmen and civil servants who have been arrested by the military-backed caretaker government on corruption charges .
the drive against corruption seems to have been welcomed by many ordinary bangladeshis tired of seeing politicians and their relatives siphoning off the country 's wealth .
the bbc 's john sudworth in dhaka says that after days of political manoeuvring with the intention of sending the country 's two most powerful political leaders into exile , the emergency government has seemingly backed down .
he says that the government seems to have badly misjudged the mood of the people .
it has argued that reform of the political system would be impossible while the two former prime ministers are still on the scene .
our correspondent says the two women seem to have won this particular battle with the government - which is perhaps a sign of just how much political clout they still wield .

doctors would select embryos free from a gene which carries a greater risk of the cancer , but which does not necessarily mean it will develop .
paul serhal of university college hospital , london , is applying to test for the brca1 gene .
the human fertilisation and embryology authority has agreed it in principle .
approval may come within the next few months .
" designer babies " until recently , the screening - called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- - was approved only for genes that always cause diseases when inherited , such as in cystic fibrosis .
in 2004 , the hfea awarded experts at university college hospital a licence to screen for a bowel cancer that does not normally develop until the late teens or early adulthood . "

however , it still has to approve each application on a " case by case " basis - something these couples are still waiting for .
critics say if the hfea does give the go ahead it is a continued journey down a slippery slope to " designer babies " .
there is concern that in the future embryos could be screened for non-lethal and even trivial conditions .
also , the procedure means that affected embryos are created and then destroyed .
choice any applications to the hfea would go through a " peer review " , being examined by other scientists before a licence would be awarded , he added .
helen and matthew are one of the two couples hoping to receive the test .
helen , 22 and from bedford , told the times newspaper : " i have lived much of my life with cancer and death , and the fear that i might have to face it and might pass on the risk to my children .
" this gives us a chance to make sure that our daughters wo n't have the same experience . "
paul serhal told radio 4 's today programme : " what we are doing here is giving parents an option to spare their children the trauma that they had to go through and eradicate this genetic transmission that has been happening from generation to generation . "
josephine quintavalle of comment on reproductive ethics said : " this is not an acceptable way forward.it is not a solution to breast cancer and not a cure .
" it 's already leading in the direction of a quest for perfection . "
dr sarah rawlings of breakthrough breast cancer said : " the decision to use embryonic screening for diseases like breast cancer is a complex and very personal issue .
" women with a family history of breast cancer tell us that what might be right for one woman may not be the best option for another .
" it 's important for anyone affected to have access to appropriate information and support so they can make the right choice for them . "
pgd involves genetically testing an embryo in a laboratory .

in 2004 , the hfea awarded experts at university college hospital a licence to screen for a bowel cancer that does not normally develop until the late teens or early adulthood .
what we are doing here is giving parents an option to spare their children the trauma that they had to go through helen , a woman who hopes to be able to take up the screening q & a : pgd last may , the watchdog ruled it acceptable for doctors to screen embryos for genes such as brca1 , which raise the risk of cancer in adulthood by 60-80 % .
however , it still has to approve each application on a " case by case " basis - something these couples are still waiting for .
critics say if the hfea does give the go ahead it is a continued journey down a slippery slope to " designer babies " .
there is concern that in the future embryos could be screened for non-lethal and even trivial conditions .
also , the procedure means that affected embryos are created and then destroyed .
choice any applications to the hfea would go through a " peer review " , being examined by other scientists before a licence would be awarded , he added .
helen and matthew are one of the two couples hoping to receive the test .
helen , 22 and from bedford , told the times newspaper : " i have lived much of my life with cancer and death , and the fear that i might have to face it and might pass on the risk to my children .
" this gives us a chance to make sure that our daughters wo n't have the same experience . "
paul serhal told radio 4 's today programme : " what we are doing here is giving parents an option to spare their children the trauma that they had to go through and eradicate this genetic transmission that has been happening from generation to generation . "
josephine quintavalle of comment on reproductive ethics said : " this is not an acceptable way forward.it is not a solution to breast cancer and not a cure .
" it 's already leading in the direction of a quest for perfection . "
dr sarah rawlings of breakthrough breast cancer said : " the decision to use embryonic screening for diseases like breast cancer is a complex and very personal issue .
" women with a family history of breast cancer tell us that what might be right for one woman may not be the best option for another .
" it 's important for anyone affected to have access to appropriate information and support so they can make the right choice for them . "
pgd involves genetically testing an embryo in a laboratory .
in order to achieve this , couples have in vitro fertilisation -lrb- ivf -rrb- treatment followed by an additional genetic testing stage .

this wider study will run alongside its continuing investigation into the banks ' charges for unauthorised overdrafts and bounced cheques .

health protection agency -lrb- hpa -rrb- data showed 55,681 cases were reported among over 65s in 2006 - up 8 % in a year .
mrsa cases continued their downward trend , but they are not falling quickly enough to meet next year 's target .
the hpa said c. difficile rates were " very high " and the patients association called for more to be done to protect patients from bugs .
hospital bugs c. difficile is a bacterium found in the gut of up to 3 % of healthy adults and 66 % of infants , although it rarely causes problems certain antibiotics can disturb the normal balance , allowing the bug to thrive and causing severe diarrhoea and in some cases severe inflammation of the bowel which can be life threatening mrsa stands for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , but is shorthand for any strain of staphylococcus bacteria which is resistant to one or more conventional antibiotics .
mrsa infections can cause a broad range of symptoms depending on the part of the body that is infected quick guide : hospital bugs patients association spokeswoman katherine murphy said : " too many people are dying from these infections .
we must learn from other countries such as holland which have got infection rates close to zero .
" that is what we should be aiming for .
we need to make nhs chief executives more accountable and ring-fence infection control budgets as it is to easy to raid them when there are cuts . "
she also said all patients should be screened - at the moment only those at highest risk are routinely tested as they enter hospital .
in november 2004 , then health secretary john reid pledged mrsa rates would be halved by april 2008 .
but government memo , sent to ministers by a department of health official last year , predicted it would only be cut by a third by then .
the same memo said c. difficile , a stomach bug which can cause potentially life-threatening bowel inflammation problems , was now " endemic throughout the health service , with virtually all trusts reporting cases " .
targets ministers have asked nhs trusts to set their own targets to reduce c. difficile rates .
the latest figures confirm the problems - although the rate of increase in c. difficile is slowing .
from 2004 to 2005 , there was a 17 % rise compared to the 8 % being reported last year .
there were 1,542 mrsa bloodstream infections from october to december 2006 - 7 % down on the previous quarter .
the hpa does not look at deaths although figures from 2004 show that mrsa was mentioned on over 1,000 death certificates in england and wales , while c difficile was listed on over 2,000 .
dr mark enright , an expert on infections from imperial college london , said : " c. difficile has hit the nhs out of nowhere and we are still getting our head around dealing with it . "
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said : " the government has badly let down nhs staff and the patients they care for . "
and lib dem health spokesman norman lamb said " tougher action was needed " .
but the department of health said " progress " was being made , although more work was needed .
a spokesman added : " patients deserve to be treated in a safe clean environment and have the highest standards of care every time . "

more than 250,000 ps3 owners have enrolled their console in the folding @ home project which uses it to study the shapes proteins assume .
so many have signed up that the project has carried out a year 's worth of research in a month .
proteins that do not fold correctly have been implicated in diseases such as alzheimers and bse .
speedy science the folding @ home -lrb- f @ h -rrb- project uses idle machines , be they pcs or game consoles , to simulate how proteins , the building blocks of life , assume the forms that play key roles in living tissue .
a better understanding of these folded forms could help tackle disease or help manipulate or mimic these vital structures .
the project , like many others , tries to solve hugely complicated problems by splitting them up into thousands of much smaller tasks .
by harnessing thousands of idle machines to do hundreds of thousands of these smaller tasks it becomes possible to do analysis that would take years to complete on a single supercomputer .
" thanks to ps3 , we have performed simulations in the first few weeks that would normally take us more than a year to calculate , " said vijay pande , associate professor of chemistry at stanford university and leader of the folding @ home project .
sony signed up to f @ h in march and those that have downloaded the program have , at their busiest , racked up a total computing power of more than 700 teraflops .
the average computational power delivered by these users is about 400 teraflops .

more than 250,000 ps3 owners have enrolled their console in the folding @ home project which uses it to study the shapes proteins assume .
so many have signed up that the project has carried out a year 's worth of research in a month .
proteins that do not fold correctly have been implicated in diseases such as alzheimers and bse .
speedy science the folding @ home -lrb- f @ h -rrb- project uses idle machines , be they pcs or game consoles , to simulate how proteins , the building blocks of life , assume the forms that play key roles in living tissue .
a better understanding of these folded forms could help tackle disease or help manipulate or mimic these vital structures .
the project , like many others , tries to solve hugely complicated problems by splitting them up into thousands of much smaller tasks .
by harnessing thousands of idle machines to do hundreds of thousands of these smaller tasks it becomes possible to do analysis that would take years to complete on a single supercomputer .
" thanks to ps3 , we have performed simulations in the first few weeks that would normally take us more than a year to calculate , " said vijay pande , associate professor of chemistry at stanford university and leader of the folding @ home project .
sony signed up to f @ h in march and those that have downloaded the program have , at their busiest , racked up a total computing power of more than 700 teraflops .

whether they are little green men or the grey , bug-eyed aliens beloved of those who live in hope that we are not alone , the one message all the scientists can agree on is do not hold your breath waiting for their knock at the door .
at a distance of more than 20 light years from earth , gliese 581c is not exactly on the doorstep .
so far we know it is about three times the diameter of the third rock from our sun and just like our home , it lies in the so called " goldilocks zone " , that relatively narrow band of space around a star that is neither too hot nor too cold for us to hope that life may have evolved there ask the experts what life may be like and that is where the disagreements start to emerge .
" the planet may be habitable , but i would n't expect to see any intelligent life forms , " says martin griffiths , senior lecturer at the centre for astronomy and science education at the university of glamorgan .
" we might see bacteria or something like that .
you have to consider that for three billion years of our own evolution , the entire continuum of life here was microbiological , so i 'd expect to find something like that . "
down the years most of our images of alien life have come not from the world of science but from the field of entertainment .
scientific speculation has led to the appearance of everything from airborne jellyfish drifting through alien skies to heavily armoured crab like creatures scuttling across deserts warmed by distant suns , on television and cinema screens . "
we 're limited by our imaginations in a way life on alien worlds certainly would n't be " professor jack cohen , astrobiologist hollywood and home-grown depictions of extra-terrestrials maybe be dismissed by the world of science , but dr jack cohen , author of the book , what does a martian look like ? ' says fellow academics are probably no closer to the truth .
" we 're limited by our imaginations in a way life on alien worlds certainly would n't be , " he says .
" if you ran the earth again as an experiment , you would n't get humans .
what a planet is like does n't determine what the evolution will be like . "
what scientific speculation there has been , he compared to the early fossil hunters who devised entire creatures from a few scraps of a skeleton - often producing creatures that seem almost comic in the eyes of today 's dinosaur experts .
' expect the unexpected ' dr cohen says life on other worlds might be so completely different to anything humans have knowledge of , it might not even be recognisable to us as life .
professor mark brake , who helped set up the first course in britain into the study of astrobiology says we are no closer to finding out what life of other worlds might be like than when the greek satirist lucian first speculated on the idea around 100ad .
" my first thought on all this is a line from the hitch hiker 's guide to the galaxy that you should expect the unexpected , " he says .
" whatever life out there looks like , it 's more likely than not it wo n't be anything like us at all . "
any life forms would have evolved to deal with the planet 's gravity which would be around one-and-a-half times that of the earth 's , because of its greater mass .
does that mean any extra-terrestrial visitors from the newly found planet would be able to leap tall buildings here on earth like superman , that other product of a high gravity alien world ?
" going to visit them would certainly make us feel heavier and it would take more effort just walking around , " says martin griffiths .
" it would n't have a substantial effect on us in the short-term , but if we stayed we 'd probably evolve ourselves into people who were short and squat . "
voyage of discovery the only way we will ever know for certain whether life exists on this new super-size earth will be to go there , and with current space exploration technology that wo n't be happening any time soon .
" i just wish i was alive to see that day , " says mathematician and part-time sci-fi writer , professor ian stewart of the university of warwick .
but like many interested in the relatively new science of astrobiology , he is travelling hopefully on the still earth-bound voyage of discovery .
" a few years ago we could n't find planets out there , then the ones we could see were too big to support life and now we 've found one that 's almost earth size so at least i 've lived to see that . "
add your comments on this story , using the form below .
why does everyone insist life forms on a different planet would be so radically different from those of our own ?
just look at the diversity of life forms here on earth , from creatures with no legs to those with hundreds , from those living in extreme cold to those in extreme heat .
it could be that there are certain optimum forms that evolution strives towards given certain environmental conditions , in which case could we not expect to see familiar life forms from amoeba-like to fish-like to reptile-like to mammal-like and even human-like zaphod beeblebrox , magrathea think how big a dna molecule is .
then think how likely it is that an alien planet has replicated dna exactly .
rna , chlorophyll , haemoglobin & proteins are not exactly small molecules either .
there is almost no possibility that alien life has replicated the biochemistry of life on earth .
mark kidger , madrid , spain if it might not even be recognisable to us as life - what 's to say that life exists on earth that we do n't recognise either ?
ash thomas , uk why do you bother publishing this rubbish ?
the planet has not been directly observed , if it exists it is most probably tidally locked -lrb- i.e. it permanently presents one face to the sun -rrb- so one face is frozen and the other is extremely hot , its existence is postulated on there being a fourth planet in the system whose existence has been assumed , any events which can be viewed from earth happened 20.5 million years ago , if the astronomical distances can be believed , we do not know whether it or its star even still exist and we can not ever get there to find out .
john , banbridge of course we 're not alone in the universe .
with the universe so unimaginably huge and still expanding from the big bang , it would be arrogant in the extreme to believe we are the only intelligent beings in it .
jay brown , portsmouth , uk i do agree with dr cohen when he remarks " we 're limited by our imaginations in a way life on alien worlds certainly would n't be , " .
there could be dimensions that are invisible to us and other forms of intelligence that are incomprehensible to us .
this universe is so vast , that we can not be the solitary intelligent beings around .
maybe the life exists in a form yet unknown to us .
is it or could it be really life ?
arun dhadwal , aix en provence in all science fiction , aliens are generally depicted with 2 eyes , nose and a mouth , i think we are going to be in for a stock when we actually see life from another planet .
nick farina , liverpool i 've been visiting your planet for some time , and i 'd just like to say how disappointed i am that my wonderful home is given a pretty miserable label of gliese 581c !
is ' alien ' life hostile ? !
we are if you do n't start calling it by it 's proper name of ghrsssydzklflapp !
fleep bloort , nottingham , uk , earth , milky way how on earth -lrb- pardon the pun -rrb- can scientists determine the atmosphere of a planet approx 20 million million miles away when we have difficulty getting reliable weather forecasts for the next couple of days ? !
a. sceptic , wigan / uk i think it 's worth pointing out that radio communication with this planet would travel at the speed of light -lrb- as you say -rrb- , and so we would be waiting 40 years for each reply - and that 's assuming that we could even make meaningful contact .
travel times are much higher - the fastest speed ever attained by a manned spacecraft is about 40,000 kph -lrb- apollo 10 's re-entry -rrb- , so even if we could achieve that speed for the entire journey , it would still take about 550,000 years to get there .
even transmissions from an unmanned probe would take 20 years to reach us , and that 's not including the travel time for the probe to get there .
this seems to me like a story that is of human interest , but has no practical implications .
call me a cynic , but i do n't think anything meaningful will come of this .

whether they are little green men or the grey , bug-eyed aliens beloved of those who live in hope that we are not alone , the one message all the scientists can agree on is do not hold your breath waiting for their knock at the door .
life out there may not resemble anything we 've seen before at a distance of more than 20 light years from earth , gliese 581c is not exactly on the doorstep .
so far we know it is about three times the diameter of the third rock from our sun and just like our home , it lies in the so called " goldilocks zone " , that relatively narrow band of space around a star that is neither too hot nor too cold for us to hope that life may have evolved there ask the experts what life may be like and that is where the disagreements start to emerge .
" the planet may be habitable , but i would n't expect to see any intelligent life forms , " says martin griffiths , senior lecturer at the centre for astronomy and science education at the university of glamorgan .
" we might see bacteria or something like that .
you have to consider that for three billion years of our own evolution , the entire continuum of life here was microbiological , so i 'd expect to find something like that . "
down the years most of our images of alien life have come not from the world of science but from the field of entertainment .
scientific speculation has led to the appearance of everything from airborne jellyfish drifting through alien skies to heavily armoured crab like creatures scuttling across deserts warmed by distant suns , on television and cinema screens .
we 're limited by our imaginations in a way life on alien worlds certainly would n't be professor jack cohen , astrobiologist hollywood and home-grown depictions of extra-terrestrials maybe be dismissed by the world of science , but dr jack cohen , author of the book , what does a martian look like ? ' says fellow academics are probably no closer to the truth .
" we 're limited by our imaginations in a way life on alien worlds certainly would n't be , " he says .
" if you ran the earth again as an experiment , you would n't get humans .
what a planet is like does n't determine what the evolution will be like . "
what scientific speculation there has been , he compared to the early fossil hunters who devised entire creatures from a few scraps of a skeleton - often producing creatures that seem almost comic in the eyes of today 's dinosaur experts .
' expect the unexpected ' dr cohen says life on other worlds might be so completely different to anything humans have knowledge of , it might not even be recognisable to us as life .
professor mark brake , who helped set up the first course in britain into the study of astrobiology says we are no closer to finding out what life of other worlds might be like than when the greek satirist lucian first speculated on the idea around 100ad .
" my first thought on all this is a line from the hitch hiker 's guide to the galaxy that you should expect the unexpected , " he says .
would aliens be hostile ?
" whatever life out there looks like , it 's more likely than not it wo n't be anything like us at all . "
any life forms would have evolved to deal with the planet 's gravity which would be around one-and-a-half times that of the earth 's , because of its greater mass .
does that mean any extra-terrestrial visitors from the newly found planet would be able to leap tall buildings here on earth like superman , that other product of a high gravity alien world ?
" going to visit them would certainly make us feel heavier and it would take more effort just walking around , " says martin griffiths .
" it would n't have a substantial effect on us in the short-term , but if we stayed we 'd probably evolve ourselves into people who were short and squat . "
voyage of discovery the only way we will ever know for certain whether life exists on this new super-size earth will be to go there , and with current space exploration technology that wo n't be happening any time soon .
" i just wish i was alive to see that day , " says mathematician and part-time sci-fi writer , professor ian stewart of the university of warwick .
but like many interested in the relatively new science of astrobiology , he is travelling hopefully on the still earth-bound voyage of discovery .
" a few years ago we could n't find planets out there , then the ones we could see were too big to support life and now we 've found one that 's almost earth size so at least i 've lived to see that . "
add your comments on this story , using the form below .
why does everyone insist life forms on a different planet would be so radically different from those of our own ?
just look at the diversity of life forms here on earth , from creatures with no legs to those with hundreds , from those living in extreme cold to those in extreme heat .
it could be that there are certain optimum forms that evolution strives towards given certain environmental conditions , in which case could we not expect to see familiar life forms from amoeba-like to fish-like to reptile-like to mammal-like and even human-like zaphod beeblebrox , magrathea think how big a dna molecule is .
then think how likely it is that an alien planet has replicated dna exactly .
rna , chlorophyll , haemoglobin & proteins are not exactly small molecules either .
there is almost no possibility that alien life has replicated the biochemistry of life on earth .
mark kidger , madrid , spain if it might not even be recognisable to us as life - what 's to say that life exists on earth that we do n't recognise either ?
ash thomas , uk why do you bother publishing this rubbish ?
the planet has not been directly observed , if it exists it is most probably tidally locked -lrb- i.e. it permanently presents one face to the sun -rrb- so one face is frozen and the other is extremely hot , its existence is postulated on there being a fourth planet in the system whose existence has been assumed , any events which can be viewed from earth happened 20.5 million years ago , if the astronomical distances can be believed , we do not know whether it or its star even still exist and we can not ever get there to find out .
john , banbridge of course we 're not alone in the universe .
with the universe so unimaginably huge and still expanding from the big bang , it would be arrogant in the extreme to believe we are the only intelligent beings in it .
jay brown , portsmouth , uk i do agree with dr cohen when he remarks " we 're limited by our imaginations in a way life on alien worlds certainly would n't be , " .
there could be dimensions that are invisible to us and other forms of intelligence that are incomprehensible to us .
this universe is so vast , that we can not be the solitary intelligent beings around .
maybe the life exists in a form yet unknown to us .
is it or could it be really life ?
arun dhadwal , aix en provence in all science fiction , aliens are generally depicted with 2 eyes , nose and a mouth , i think we are going to be in for a stock when we actually see life from another planet .
nick farina , liverpool i 've been visiting your planet for some time , and i 'd just like to say how disappointed i am that my wonderful home is given a pretty miserable label of gliese 581c !
is ' alien ' life hostile ? !
we are if you do n't start calling it by it 's proper name of ghrsssydzklflapp !
fleep bloort , nottingham , uk , earth , milky way how on earth -lrb- pardon the pun -rrb- can scientists determine the atmosphere of a planet approx 20 million million miles away when we have difficulty getting reliable weather forecasts for the next couple of days ? !
a. sceptic , wigan / uk i think it 's worth pointing out that radio communication with this planet would travel at the speed of light -lrb- as you say -rrb- , and so we would be waiting 40 years for each reply - and that 's assuming that we could even make meaningful contact .
travel times are much higher - the fastest speed ever attained by a manned spacecraft is about 40,000 kph -lrb- apollo 10 's re-entry -rrb- , so even if we could achieve that speed for the entire journey , it would still take about 550,000 years to get there .
even transmissions from an unmanned probe would take 20 years to reach us , and that 's not including the travel time for the probe to get there .
this seems to me like a story that is of human interest , but has no practical implications .
call me a cynic , but i do n't think anything meaningful will come of this .
