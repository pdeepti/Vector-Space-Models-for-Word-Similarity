spiegel said ibrahim had prepared a will , found in his younger brother 's german lodgings , in which he termed himself a mujahid , or jihad warrior . the magazine said hamad had said in a jail interview that the plot had been a mistake and he thanked god the suitcase bombs had not exploded on the two german cross-country trains . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " terrorists today are targeting society itself " as a landmark terrorism trial opened in spain , deutsche welle spoke to a german terror expert about who the terrorists of today are and what they have in common with terrorists of the past .

iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .
" but at the same time if the path changes from the diplomatic path to the path of pressure iran is ready to withstand pressure . " iran 's stance softens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani was the man trusted with breaking the deadlock iran 's arrest of the british sailors on accusations of trespassing on its waters on march 23 was seen by the west as further proof of the islamic republic 's radicalism and intransigence .
but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation . " the german presidency of the european union welcomed the release of the british naval personnel , saying the eu had " repeatedly contacted the iranian authorities to intercede strongly on behalf of the 15 british sailors and marines . " german eu presidency hopes for further dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes that a door to dialogue has opened the german statement added that the eu hoped iran would now work with the international community to find solutions in other areas .
in particular it called on iran to " seek a solution to the controversy over the iranian nuclear program through dialogue and negotiation , " in terms of an offer made by the foreign ministers of china , france , germany , russia , britain and the us . while president mahomoud ahmadinejad announced news of the release in a typical coup-de-theatre during a press conference , no such decision is taken without the prior approval of iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . khamenei , an unswerving revolutionary who nonetheless eschews the provocative rhetoric of his president , has the last say on all foreign policy issues in the islamic republic . " the release of the sailors is the work of the leader .
it was he who gave larijani the lead in the talks and took the decision that needed to be taken , " said a western diplomat in tehran , who asked not to be named . coming days after the united nations agreed a second set of sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program , the crisis came at a perilous time for relations between tehran and the west . western powers fear iran is seeking nuclear weapons - a charge vehemently denied by tehran - and the united states has never ruled out the option of military action to bring tehran to heel . iran has already shown a degree of pragmatism in some aspects of the nuclear standoff - most noticeably by the way it failed to carry out threats to sever cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog after the first sanctions resolution . however iran 's nuclear chief ali larijani has told the european union there was no chance tehran would suspend its programme of uranium enrichment , state television reported on thursday .
he made the comments in a telephone conversation on wednesday with the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana .
" the islamic republic of iran is ready to negotiate only on non-diversion -lrb- of its nuclear programme for military purposes -rrb- and not on its nuclear rights , " larijani was quoted as saying by an official of the supreme council for national security , which he heads .
" iran will not accept any preconditions or suspension for a time .
nor can suspending enrichment be a precondition or the result of negotiations " with the five permanent un security council members plus germany , he was quoted as saying . concilliation gives hope in nuclear stand-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad made a theatrical but important speech despite larijani 's defiant comments , mohebian said wednesday 's dramatic events showed that the authorities have no qualms of acting in a conciliatory fashion when the situation requires - something that could have an impact on the nuclear crisis . " the iranian regime is structured in a way that there is a substantial room for maneuver in decision-making .
although the situation was grave it is ready to make quick decisions in order to cut down the tension , " said mohebian . " this diplomacy can be repeated elsewhere , according to the political situation " said mohebian .
" iran is seeking to change and correct its image worldwide .

bremen drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in holland . bayer leverkusen effectively shot themselves in the foot as far as progressing to the uefa cup semi-finals thursday by losing 3-0 at home to spanish side osasuna . the germans ’ quarter-final opponents struck in the opening minute and twice more in a 90 second spell in the second-half for an emphatic triumph which puts the 1988 champions in danger of crashing out unless they can stage a remarkable fight-back in spain next week . javier cueller gave the spaniards a dream start when he headed home a corner kick 55 seconds into the first leg game in germany .
david lopez doubled the lead in the 71st after his first attempt was saved by goalkeeper rene adler . leverkusen 's biggest home defeat in europe was sealed less than two minutes later with a lobbed own goal by pierre webo , who had come on as a substitute just seconds earlier . leverkusen controlled possession but were unable to crack the firm osasuna defense which has allowed just one goal in six uefa cup games . “ things do n't look good for us now .
we did n't play up to our potential while they were good on the counter and deserved to win , ” said leverkusen 's germany midfielder bernd schneider . lopez and enrique coralles will miss the return leg at home after being booked for time-wasting , but the match next thursday appears a mere formality for osasuna , who are one of three spanish clubs in the final eight . werder still in with a shot werder bremen , the other german side still in the uefa cup , faced their second dutch side in as many rounds as they traveled to az alkmaar . bremen fought to a difficult 0-0 draw which extended the dutch side 's unbeaten run at home to 30 games since they entered european competition in 1977 . coached by former barcelona and holland manager louis van gaal , alkmaar went into the match as the competition 's top scorers this season but a resolute bremen defense kept the free-scoring dutch at bay – and nearly grabbed themselves a valuable away goal in the process . clemens fritz had the germans ’ best chance when he sprinted onto a defense-splitting back-heel from playmaker diego but his shot was well saved . alkmaar started slowly and their first chance came on the half-hour when winger julian jenner crossed for maarten martens but his header was turned over the bar by bremen goalkeeper tim wiese . the second-half was much livelier with werder ’ s left back pierre wome and diego both denied by great saves by az goalie boy waterman . tim wiese was also busy at the other end ; the best save of the half coming when he smothered a close range attempt from belgian striker moussa dembele . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german teams make two-sided attack on uefa cup both bremen and leverkusen grabbed wins in the second leg of their uefa cup matches to advance to the quarterfinals .

iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .
" but at the same time if the path changes from the diplomatic path to the path of pressure iran is ready to withstand pressure . " iran 's stance softens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani was the man trusted with breaking the deadlock iran 's arrest of the british sailors on accusations of trespassing on its waters on march 23 was seen by the west as further proof of the islamic republic 's radicalism and intransigence .
but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation .

" german eu presidency hopes for further dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes that a door to dialogue has opened the german statement added that the eu hoped iran would now work with the international community to find solutions in other areas .
in particular it called on iran to " seek a solution to the controversy over the iranian nuclear program through dialogue and negotiation , " in terms of an offer made by the foreign ministers of china , france , germany , russia , britain and the us . while president mahomoud ahmadinejad announced news of the release in a typical coup-de-theatre during a press conference , no such decision is taken without the prior approval of iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . khamenei , an unswerving revolutionary who nonetheless eschews the provocative rhetoric of his president , has the last say on all foreign policy issues in the islamic republic . " the release of the sailors is the work of the leader .
it was he who gave larijani the lead in the talks and took the decision that needed to be taken , " said a western diplomat in tehran , who asked not to be named . coming days after the united nations agreed a second set of sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program , the crisis came at a perilous time for relations between tehran and the west . western powers fear iran is seeking nuclear weapons - a charge vehemently denied by tehran - and the united states has never ruled out the option of military action to bring tehran to heel . iran has already shown a degree of pragmatism in some aspects of the nuclear standoff - most noticeably by the way it failed to carry out threats to sever cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog after the first sanctions resolution . however iran 's nuclear chief ali larijani has told the european union there was no chance tehran would suspend its programme of uranium enrichment , state television reported on thursday .
he made the comments in a telephone conversation on wednesday with the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana .
" the islamic republic of iran is ready to negotiate only on non-diversion -lrb- of its nuclear programme for military purposes -rrb- and not on its nuclear rights , " larijani was quoted as saying by an official of the supreme council for national security , which he heads .
" iran will not accept any preconditions or suspension for a time .

iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .
" but at the same time if the path changes from the diplomatic path to the path of pressure iran is ready to withstand pressure . " iran 's stance softens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani was the man trusted with breaking the deadlock iran 's arrest of the british sailors on accusations of trespassing on its waters on march 23 was seen by the west as further proof of the islamic republic 's radicalism and intransigence .
but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation . " the german presidency of the european union welcomed the release of the british naval personnel , saying the eu had " repeatedly contacted the iranian authorities to intercede strongly on behalf of the 15 british sailors and marines . " german eu presidency hopes for further dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes that a door to dialogue has opened the german statement added that the eu hoped iran would now work with the international community to find solutions in other areas .
in particular it called on iran to " seek a solution to the controversy over the iranian nuclear program through dialogue and negotiation , " in terms of an offer made by the foreign ministers of china , france , germany , russia , britain and the us . while president mahomoud ahmadinejad announced news of the release in a typical coup-de-theatre during a press conference , no such decision is taken without the prior approval of iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . khamenei , an unswerving revolutionary who nonetheless eschews the provocative rhetoric of his president , has the last say on all foreign policy issues in the islamic republic . " the release of the sailors is the work of the leader .
it was he who gave larijani the lead in the talks and took the decision that needed to be taken , " said a western diplomat in tehran , who asked not to be named . coming days after the united nations agreed a second set of sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program , the crisis came at a perilous time for relations between tehran and the west . western powers fear iran is seeking nuclear weapons - a charge vehemently denied by tehran - and the united states has never ruled out the option of military action to bring tehran to heel . iran has already shown a degree of pragmatism in some aspects of the nuclear standoff - most noticeably by the way it failed to carry out threats to sever cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog after the first sanctions resolution . however iran 's nuclear chief ali larijani has told the european union there was no chance tehran would suspend its programme of uranium enrichment , state television reported on thursday .
he made the comments in a telephone conversation on wednesday with the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana .
" the islamic republic of iran is ready to negotiate only on non-diversion -lrb- of its nuclear programme for military purposes -rrb- and not on its nuclear rights , " larijani was quoted as saying by an official of the supreme council for national security , which he heads .
" iran will not accept any preconditions or suspension for a time .
nor can suspending enrichment be a precondition or the result of negotiations " with the five permanent un security council members plus germany , he was quoted as saying . concilliation gives hope in nuclear stand-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad made a theatrical but important speech despite larijani 's defiant comments , mohebian said wednesday 's dramatic events showed that the authorities have no qualms of acting in a conciliatory fashion when the situation requires - something that could have an impact on the nuclear crisis . " the iranian regime is structured in a way that there is a substantial room for maneuver in decision-making .
although the situation was grave it is ready to make quick decisions in order to cut down the tension , " said mohebian . " this diplomacy can be repeated elsewhere , according to the political situation " said mohebian .
" iran is seeking to change and correct its image worldwide .

" the report confirms that climate change is a fact , ' merkel told the saturday edition of the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .

" this year we have to set course for a multilateral climate protection regime for the period after 2012 , in order to prevent global warming of more than two degrees celsius compared with pre-industrial values , " gabriel said in berlin .
the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . the european union , under the current german presidency , set a goal of cutting co2 emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 at a summit in brussels march 8-9 .
this would be increased to 30 percent , if other major countries followed suit , the member states agreed . germany is hosting the g8 summit in june , where the major industrialized states are expected to put climate change and energy at the top of the agenda . " i will address the theme at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , " merkel told newspaper .

if this was implemented , electricity generation would produce 170 million tons of co2 a year , against a total target for germany of 200 million tons , she added . she also questioned the viability of plans to extract co2 from exhaust gases and to store it indefinitely . speaking ahead of the report 's publication , german development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said : " industrialized countries have a responsibility .
they must cut emissions radically . " she called simultaneously for more aid to developing countries , which would suffer the worst effects of climate change .
protecting tropical rainforests should have " absolute priority , " the minister said , adding that up to a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions resulted from the clearing of the rainforests .

he was critical of the wrangling over detail in the negotiations leading up to the report 's publication . " one should no longer be fighting over the intensity and probability of climate change , " he said .
" climate change has occurred , it is speeding up , and it is caused by people . " there was a broad movement among ordinary people and business in the united states towards greater climate protection , töpfer said . the chinese leadership had also realized the country needed to emit less co2 . " even in the oil-producing arab countries , there will be rising interest in energy not based on oil , " he predicted . töpfer said the un security council would discuss the issue .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reclusive billionaire kerkorian is renowed for deal-making the 89-year-old casino mogul , who failed in his 1995 hostile takeover bid of chrysler , indicated his firm would offer an equity partnership to the united auto workers -lrb- uaw -rrb- and senior management of chrysler as a means of gaining their commitment to his long-term solution . but tracinda said the offer hinges on reaching a deal with daimlerchrysler on sharing chrysler 's massive pension and health care liabilities and getting the uaw to agree to a " new satisfactory collective bargaining agreement " in negotiations this fall . " tracinda believes by taking a long-term approach to solving chrysler 's problems , it can become a robust and lasting , stand-alone entity , " the statement added . daimlerchrysler open to " all options " tracinda offered daimlerchrysler a 100-million dollar deposit in exchange for exclusive due diligence rights , which it said it could complete in 60 days . daimlerchrysler spokesman han tjan declined to comment on the tracinda bid but reiterated chairman dieter zetsche 's statements wednesday confirming that the company is in talks with interested third parties and that " all options " are on the table . a representative from the united auto workers was not immediately available for comment . kerkorian , who last made headlines with his failed bid to push general motors corp. into an alliance with renault-nissan , was chrysler 's largest individual shareholder at the time of the 1998 merger with daimler-benz . he later launched a lawsuit trying to recover billions in damages after he said the companies misled investors about the nature of the deal . dream marriage on the rocks nine years down the line , what was originally billed as a " dream marriage " of daimler and chrysler now appears to be on the rocks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler boss dieter zetsche in what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around , daimlerchrysler unveiled in february plans to slash 13,000 more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary and said it would consider " all options . " chief executive dieter zetsche confirmed wednesday that it was in talks over a possible sale of chrysler but revealed few details at the group 's annual meeting in berlin .
a number of shareholders at the meeting called for a rapid sale . analysts estimate chrysler 's value at between five and seven billion dollars , compared with its purchase price of more than $ 35 billion .
despite a series of restructuring plans , chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year as consumers shied away from the fuel-hungry trucks and sports utility vehicles that had dominated its offerings . the company is reportedly considering firm offers from private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund . the head of the canadian auto workers has expressed a preference for magna out of concern that a private group would be less committed to building the business . kerkorian among wealthiest americans tracinda said in a letter to zetsche that " a private ownership approach is in the best interest of all chrysler constituencies . " tracinda representative jerry york said it would take five to seven years to rebuild chrysler by shifting the product mix towards " greener " segments , improving product quality to eliminate a consumer bias towards asian products and speeding up the introduction of new models in order to compete with asian automakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an american flag flies outside a merecedes-benz dealership in michigan tracinda 's attempt to get the union to accept an equity stake as a way to diffuse health care costs could bode well for the other us automakers , said jp morgan analyst himanshu patel . " if the uaw proves supportive of tracinda 's bid , we think it could have positive ramifications for gm and ford , as it may signal the union 's willingness to negotiate solutions to healthcare at the upcoming contract renewal talks , " he wrote in a research report . kerkorian was ranked 26th in a forbes magazine list of the wealthiest americans , with a net worth estimated at nine billion dollars .
his chief holding is mgm mirage , which owns about half of the hotel rooms on the las vegas strip . the son of an armenian immigrant , kerkorian grew up in fresno , california .
after dropping out of school , he boxed for a while under the moniker " rifle right , " before joining the royal air force to fly supply planes from canada to britain during world war ii . after the war , his love of flying and risk-taking drew him to las vegas , where the gambling industry was in its infancy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .
-lrb- 04.04.2007 -rrb- german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.04.2007 daimlerchrysler : " a failed experiment " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel daimler should reach for the skies without chrysler weighing it down professor ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , told dw-world.de that daimlerchrysler has a bright future without the loss making chrysler business . the german-us auto giant officially confirmed on april 4 that it is in talks to sell chrysler amid growing pressure from shareholders .
it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .
they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .
financial investors go into companies , break up them up and sell the successful parts .
for example the supplier business - the component productions and the press shop and these parts could be sold and purchased by other suppliers .
brands could also be sold - jeep is a very successful brand , others like dodge and chrysler itself are weaker .
they may be sold , for example to chinese carmakers who are strong and looking to capture the american market . ceo dieter zetsche was a hero at daimlerchrysler for a while because of the success of his restructuring program in detroit , although some of the gains he made have not lasted .
do you think will stay on as ceo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes production in bremen - still very profitable i am very sure that he will continue as ceo of daimlerchrysler .
we can see now that zetsche has n't taken one false step in his two years as daimlerchrysler ceo .
he started to fix the quality at mercedes and now they are coming out with new products , such as the e-class .
currently the c-class has been very successful in some markets , like germany .
zetsche is the guy who started thinking about the future of chrysler and the future of mercedes and he started the process of talking to other parties about selling chrysler .
so he has done everything necessary to bring the group back to profit , so from my point of view there is no reason to change management . shareholders have been very unhappy about the company 's performance .
will they be more optimistic now that a sale of chrysler is likely ? i think they can be very optimistic for the future because we think chrsyler will be sold in a few months .
then they will be left with a group which consists of mercedes trucks , which is very strong ; it 's actually the global market leader .
then we have mercedes cars which is becoming stronger and stronger .
by 2009 or 2010 the new e-class will be released and that will be very important for their profitability .
they also have a strong financial services arm which is very successful .
because of these three successful parts we will see stock prices continue to increase , as will the group 's profitability . emma wynne interviewed ferdinand dudenhöffer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .
they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .
financial investors go into companies , break up them up and sell the successful parts .
for example the supplier business - the component productions and the press shop and these parts could be sold and purchased by other suppliers .
brands could also be sold - jeep is a very successful brand , others like dodge and chrysler itself are weaker .
they may be sold , for example to chinese carmakers who are strong and looking to capture the american market . ceo dieter zetsche was a hero at daimlerchrysler for a while because of the success of his restructuring program in detroit , although some of the gains he made have not lasted .
do you think will stay on as ceo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes production in bremen - still very profitable i am very sure that he will continue as ceo of daimlerchrysler .
we can see now that zetsche has n't taken one false step in his two years as daimlerchrysler ceo .
he started to fix the quality at mercedes and now they are coming out with new products , such as the e-class .
currently the c-class has been very successful in some markets , like germany .
zetsche is the guy who started thinking about the future of chrysler and the future of mercedes and he started the process of talking to other parties about selling chrysler .
so he has done everything necessary to bring the group back to profit , so from my point of view there is no reason to change management . shareholders have been very unhappy about the company 's performance .
will they be more optimistic now that a sale of chrysler is likely ? i think they can be very optimistic for the future because we think chrsyler will be sold in a few months .
then they will be left with a group which consists of mercedes trucks , which is very strong ; it 's actually the global market leader .
then we have mercedes cars which is becoming stronger and stronger .
by 2009 or 2010 the new e-class will be released and that will be very important for their profitability .
they also have a strong financial services arm which is very successful .
because of these three successful parts we will see stock prices continue to increase , as will the group 's profitability . emma wynne interviewed ferdinand dudenhöffer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reclusive billionaire kerkorian is renowed for deal-making the 89-year-old casino mogul , who failed in his 1995 hostile takeover bid of chrysler , indicated his firm would offer an equity partnership to the united auto workers -lrb- uaw -rrb- and senior management of chrysler as a means of gaining their commitment to his long-term solution . but tracinda said the offer hinges on reaching a deal with daimlerchrysler on sharing chrysler 's massive pension and health care liabilities and getting the uaw to agree to a " new satisfactory collective bargaining agreement " in negotiations this fall . " tracinda believes by taking a long-term approach to solving chrysler 's problems , it can become a robust and lasting , stand-alone entity , " the statement added . daimlerchrysler open to " all options " tracinda offered daimlerchrysler a 100-million dollar deposit in exchange for exclusive due diligence rights , which it said it could complete in 60 days . daimlerchrysler spokesman han tjan declined to comment on the tracinda bid but reiterated chairman dieter zetsche 's statements wednesday confirming that the company is in talks with interested third parties and that " all options " are on the table . a representative from the united auto workers was not immediately available for comment . kerkorian , who last made headlines with his failed bid to push general motors corp. into an alliance with renault-nissan , was chrysler 's largest individual shareholder at the time of the 1998 merger with daimler-benz . he later launched a lawsuit trying to recover billions in damages after he said the companies misled investors about the nature of the deal . dream marriage on the rocks nine years down the line , what was originally billed as a " dream marriage " of daimler and chrysler now appears to be on the rocks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler boss dieter zetsche in what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around , daimlerchrysler unveiled in february plans to slash 13,000 more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary and said it would consider " all options . " chief executive dieter zetsche confirmed wednesday that it was in talks over a possible sale of chrysler but revealed few details at the group 's annual meeting in berlin .
a number of shareholders at the meeting called for a rapid sale . analysts estimate chrysler 's value at between five and seven billion dollars , compared with its purchase price of more than $ 35 billion .
despite a series of restructuring plans , chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year as consumers shied away from the fuel-hungry trucks and sports utility vehicles that had dominated its offerings . the company is reportedly considering firm offers from private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund . the head of the canadian auto workers has expressed a preference for magna out of concern that a private group would be less committed to building the business . kerkorian among wealthiest americans tracinda said in a letter to zetsche that " a private ownership approach is in the best interest of all chrysler constituencies . " tracinda representative jerry york said it would take five to seven years to rebuild chrysler by shifting the product mix towards " greener " segments , improving product quality to eliminate a consumer bias towards asian products and speeding up the introduction of new models in order to compete with asian automakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an american flag flies outside a merecedes-benz dealership in michigan tracinda 's attempt to get the union to accept an equity stake as a way to diffuse health care costs could bode well for the other us automakers , said jp morgan analyst himanshu patel . " if the uaw proves supportive of tracinda 's bid , we think it could have positive ramifications for gm and ford , as it may signal the union 's willingness to negotiate solutions to healthcare at the upcoming contract renewal talks , " he wrote in a research report . kerkorian was ranked 26th in a forbes magazine list of the wealthiest americans , with a net worth estimated at nine billion dollars .
his chief holding is mgm mirage , which owns about half of the hotel rooms on the las vegas strip . the son of an armenian immigrant , kerkorian grew up in fresno , california .
after dropping out of school , he boxed for a while under the moniker " rifle right , " before joining the royal air force to fly supply planes from canada to britain during world war ii . after the war , his love of flying and risk-taking drew him to las vegas , where the gambling industry was in its infancy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .
" but at the same time if the path changes from the diplomatic path to the path of pressure iran is ready to withstand pressure . " iran 's stance softens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani was the man trusted with breaking the deadlock iran 's arrest of the british sailors on accusations of trespassing on its waters on march 23 was seen by the west as further proof of the islamic republic 's radicalism and intransigence .
but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation .

iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .

" the islamic republic of iran is ready to negotiate only on non-diversion -lrb- of its nuclear programme for military purposes -rrb- and not on its nuclear rights , " larijani was quoted as saying by an official of the supreme council for national security , which he heads .
" iran will not accept any preconditions or suspension for a time .
nor can suspending enrichment be a precondition or the result of negotiations " with the five permanent un security council members plus germany , he was quoted as saying . concilliation gives hope in nuclear stand-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad made a theatrical but important speech despite larijani 's defiant comments , mohebian said wednesday 's dramatic events showed that the authorities have no qualms of acting in a conciliatory fashion when the situation requires - something that could have an impact on the nuclear crisis . " the iranian regime is structured in a way that there is a substantial room for maneuver in decision-making .
although the situation was grave it is ready to make quick decisions in order to cut down the tension , " said mohebian . " this diplomacy can be repeated elsewhere , according to the political situation " said mohebian .

we did n't play up to our potential while they were good on the counter and deserved to win , ” said leverkusen 's germany midfielder bernd schneider . lopez and enrique coralles will miss the return leg at home after being booked for time-wasting , but the match next thursday appears a mere formality for osasuna , who are one of three spanish clubs in the final eight . werder still in with a shot werder bremen , the other german side still in the uefa cup , faced their second dutch side in as many rounds as they traveled to az alkmaar . bremen fought to a difficult 0-0 draw which extended the dutch side 's unbeaten run at home to 30 games since they entered european competition in 1977 . coached by former barcelona and holland manager louis van gaal , alkmaar went into the match as the competition 's top scorers this season but a resolute bremen defense kept the free-scoring dutch at bay – and nearly grabbed themselves a valuable away goal in the process . clemens fritz had the germans ’ best chance when he sprinted onto a defense-splitting back-heel from playmaker diego but his shot was well saved . alkmaar started slowly and their first chance came on the half-hour when winger julian jenner crossed for maarten martens but his header was turned over the bar by bremen goalkeeper tim wiese . the second-half was much livelier with werder ’ s left back pierre wome and diego both denied by great saves by az goalie boy waterman . tim wiese was also busy at the other end ; the best save of the half coming when he smothered a close range attempt from belgian striker moussa dembele . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german teams make two-sided attack on uefa cup both bremen and leverkusen grabbed wins in the second leg of their uefa cup matches to advance to the quarterfinals .

but the us , china and russia stand accused of seeking to water down some sections . eu leaders agreed tough targets last month for reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming , with the aim of limiting the rise in temperature to below two degrees celsius , compared to pre-industrial levels . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top expert authority on global warming , said in its report friday that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report was published after all-night negotiations in brussels " the report shows many of the serious impacts that would occur if global warming exceeded the eu 's target of not more than two degrees celsius above the pre-industrial level , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said . " the temperature today is already almost 0.8 degrees celcius above that level , so the world needs to act fast if we are to succeed in stabilizing climate change and thereby prevent its worst impacts , " he said in a statement . global warming to hit europe unevenly the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . global warming will hit europe hard but unevenly this century , cursing the south but giving a mixed blessing to the north , the report said .
mediterranean countries can brace for a higher risk of severe droughts , reduced harvests and deadly heat waves , while high-latitude nations will face flooding and severe weather balanced by longer growing seasons and expanded areas for agriculture and forestry . " today 's ipcc report spells out very clearly the severe effects that climate change will have on all of us , " dimas said .

the united states was also reported to be among countries seeking to water down sections about damaging impacts from a warming widely blamed on human use of fossil fuels . some scientists objected , for instance , after china tried to eliminate a note saying that there was " very high confidence " that climate change was already affecting " many natural systems , on all continents and in some oceans .

worsening water shortages in thirsty countries , malnutrition caused by desiccated fields , property damage from extreme weather events and the spread of disease by mosquitoes and other vectors will amount to a punishing bill that is beyond the ability of vulnerable countries , especially in africa , to pay . " poor people are the most vulnerable and will be the worst hit by the impacts of climate change .
this becomes a global responsibility , " ipcc 's chairman , rajendra pachauri , said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul repeated the warning in brussels as she reminded western countries that they are responsible for most of the world ’ s climate change .

but the us , china and russia stand accused of seeking to water down some sections . eu leaders agreed tough targets last month for reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming , with the aim of limiting the rise in temperature to below two degrees celsius , compared to pre-industrial levels . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top expert authority on global warming , said in its report friday that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report was published after all-night negotiations in brussels " the report shows many of the serious impacts that would occur if global warming exceeded the eu 's target of not more than two degrees celsius above the pre-industrial level , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said . " the temperature today is already almost 0.8 degrees celcius above that level , so the world needs to act fast if we are to succeed in stabilizing climate change and thereby prevent its worst impacts , " he said in a statement . global warming to hit europe unevenly the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . global warming will hit europe hard but unevenly this century , cursing the south but giving a mixed blessing to the north , the report said .
mediterranean countries can brace for a higher risk of severe droughts , reduced harvests and deadly heat waves , while high-latitude nations will face flooding and severe weather balanced by longer growing seasons and expanded areas for agriculture and forestry . " today 's ipcc report spells out very clearly the severe effects that climate change will have on all of us , " dimas said .
" this further underlines both how urgent it is to reach global agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and how important it is for us all to adapt to the climate change that is already under way , " he said . us , china try to dilute damning sections of report however , the report - the un 's most toughly-worded warning on climate change as yet - was the subject of fierce disputes in brussels between scientists and governments . gary yohe , one of the report 's lead authors , told reuters that the mood at the conference in brussels was tense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the us he said china , russia and saudi arabia had raised most objections during the night to a 21-page summary which has to be approved unanimously and will guide policy in coming years on issues such as extending the u.n. 's kyoto protocol beyond 2012 .
the united states was also reported to be among countries seeking to water down sections about damaging impacts from a warming widely blamed on human use of fossil fuels . some scientists objected , for instance , after china tried to eliminate a note saying that there was " very high confidence " that climate change was already affecting " many natural systems , on all continents and in some oceans . "
china , the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the united states and ahead of russia , wanted no mention of the level of confidence . poor countries most at risk the report underlined that poor tropical countries will be hit worst .
worsening water shortages in thirsty countries , malnutrition caused by desiccated fields , property damage from extreme weather events and the spread of disease by mosquitoes and other vectors will amount to a punishing bill that is beyond the ability of vulnerable countries , especially in africa , to pay . " poor people are the most vulnerable and will be the worst hit by the impacts of climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.04.2007 daimlerchrysler : " a failed experiment " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel daimler should reach for the skies without chrysler weighing it down professor ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , told dw-world.de that daimlerchrysler has a bright future without the loss making chrysler business . the german-us auto giant officially confirmed on april 4 that it is in talks to sell chrysler amid growing pressure from shareholders .
it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .
they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .
financial investors go into companies , break up them up and sell the successful parts .
for example the supplier business - the component productions and the press shop and these parts could be sold and purchased by other suppliers .
brands could also be sold - jeep is a very successful brand , others like dodge and chrysler itself are weaker .
they may be sold , for example to chinese carmakers who are strong and looking to capture the american market . ceo dieter zetsche was a hero at daimlerchrysler for a while because of the success of his restructuring program in detroit , although some of the gains he made have not lasted .
do you think will stay on as ceo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes production in bremen - still very profitable i am very sure that he will continue as ceo of daimlerchrysler .
we can see now that zetsche has n't taken one false step in his two years as daimlerchrysler ceo .
he started to fix the quality at mercedes and now they are coming out with new products , such as the e-class .
currently the c-class has been very successful in some markets , like germany .
zetsche is the guy who started thinking about the future of chrysler and the future of mercedes and he started the process of talking to other parties about selling chrysler .
so he has done everything necessary to bring the group back to profit , so from my point of view there is no reason to change management . shareholders have been very unhappy about the company 's performance .
will they be more optimistic now that a sale of chrysler is likely ? i think they can be very optimistic for the future because we think chrsyler will be sold in a few months .
then they will be left with a group which consists of mercedes trucks , which is very strong ; it 's actually the global market leader .
then we have mercedes cars which is becoming stronger and stronger .
by 2009 or 2010 the new e-class will be released and that will be very important for their profitability .
they also have a strong financial services arm which is very successful .
because of these three successful parts we will see stock prices continue to increase , as will the group 's profitability . emma wynne interviewed ferdinand dudenhöffer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.04.2007 daimlerchrysler : " a failed experiment " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel daimler should reach for the skies without chrysler weighing it down professor ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , told dw-world.de that daimlerchrysler has a bright future without the loss making chrysler business . the german-us auto giant officially confirmed on april 4 that it is in talks to sell chrysler amid growing pressure from shareholders .
it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .
they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .
financial investors go into companies , break up them up and sell the successful parts .
for example the supplier business - the component productions and the press shop and these parts could be sold and purchased by other suppliers .
brands could also be sold - jeep is a very successful brand , others like dodge and chrysler itself are weaker .
they may be sold , for example to chinese carmakers who are strong and looking to capture the american market . ceo dieter zetsche was a hero at daimlerchrysler for a while because of the success of his restructuring program in detroit , although some of the gains he made have not lasted .
do you think will stay on as ceo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes production in bremen - still very profitable i am very sure that he will continue as ceo of daimlerchrysler .

it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .
they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .
financial investors go into companies , break up them up and sell the successful parts .
for example the supplier business - the component productions and the press shop and these parts could be sold and purchased by other suppliers .
brands could also be sold - jeep is a very successful brand , others like dodge and chrysler itself are weaker .
they may be sold , for example to chinese carmakers who are strong and looking to capture the american market . ceo dieter zetsche was a hero at daimlerchrysler for a while because of the success of his restructuring program in detroit , although some of the gains he made have not lasted .
do you think will stay on as ceo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes production in bremen - still very profitable i am very sure that he will continue as ceo of daimlerchrysler .
we can see now that zetsche has n't taken one false step in his two years as daimlerchrysler ceo .
he started to fix the quality at mercedes and now they are coming out with new products , such as the e-class .
currently the c-class has been very successful in some markets , like germany .
zetsche is the guy who started thinking about the future of chrysler and the future of mercedes and he started the process of talking to other parties about selling chrysler .
so he has done everything necessary to bring the group back to profit , so from my point of view there is no reason to change management . shareholders have been very unhappy about the company 's performance .
will they be more optimistic now that a sale of chrysler is likely ? i think they can be very optimistic for the future because we think chrsyler will be sold in a few months .
then they will be left with a group which consists of mercedes trucks , which is very strong ; it 's actually the global market leader .
then we have mercedes cars which is becoming stronger and stronger .
by 2009 or 2010 the new e-class will be released and that will be very important for their profitability .
they also have a strong financial services arm which is very successful .
because of these three successful parts we will see stock prices continue to increase , as will the group 's profitability . emma wynne interviewed ferdinand dudenhöffer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reclusive billionaire kerkorian is renowed for deal-making the 89-year-old casino mogul , who failed in his 1995 hostile takeover bid of chrysler , indicated his firm would offer an equity partnership to the united auto workers -lrb- uaw -rrb- and senior management of chrysler as a means of gaining their commitment to his long-term solution . but tracinda said the offer hinges on reaching a deal with daimlerchrysler on sharing chrysler 's massive pension and health care liabilities and getting the uaw to agree to a " new satisfactory collective bargaining agreement " in negotiations this fall . " tracinda believes by taking a long-term approach to solving chrysler 's problems , it can become a robust and lasting , stand-alone entity , " the statement added . daimlerchrysler open to " all options " tracinda offered daimlerchrysler a 100-million dollar deposit in exchange for exclusive due diligence rights , which it said it could complete in 60 days . daimlerchrysler spokesman han tjan declined to comment on the tracinda bid but reiterated chairman dieter zetsche 's statements wednesday confirming that the company is in talks with interested third parties and that " all options " are on the table . a representative from the united auto workers was not immediately available for comment . kerkorian , who last made headlines with his failed bid to push general motors corp. into an alliance with renault-nissan , was chrysler 's largest individual shareholder at the time of the 1998 merger with daimler-benz . he later launched a lawsuit trying to recover billions in damages after he said the companies misled investors about the nature of the deal . dream marriage on the rocks nine years down the line , what was originally billed as a " dream marriage " of daimler and chrysler now appears to be on the rocks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler boss dieter zetsche in what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around , daimlerchrysler unveiled in february plans to slash 13,000 more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary and said it would consider " all options . " chief executive dieter zetsche confirmed wednesday that it was in talks over a possible sale of chrysler but revealed few details at the group 's annual meeting in berlin .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reclusive billionaire kerkorian is renowed for deal-making the 89-year-old casino mogul , who failed in his 1995 hostile takeover bid of chrysler , indicated his firm would offer an equity partnership to the united auto workers -lrb- uaw -rrb- and senior management of chrysler as a means of gaining their commitment to his long-term solution . but tracinda said the offer hinges on reaching a deal with daimlerchrysler on sharing chrysler 's massive pension and health care liabilities and getting the uaw to agree to a " new satisfactory collective bargaining agreement " in negotiations this fall . " tracinda believes by taking a long-term approach to solving chrysler 's problems , it can become a robust and lasting , stand-alone entity , " the statement added . daimlerchrysler open to " all options " tracinda offered daimlerchrysler a 100-million dollar deposit in exchange for exclusive due diligence rights , which it said it could complete in 60 days . daimlerchrysler spokesman han tjan declined to comment on the tracinda bid but reiterated chairman dieter zetsche 's statements wednesday confirming that the company is in talks with interested third parties and that " all options " are on the table . a representative from the united auto workers was not immediately available for comment . kerkorian , who last made headlines with his failed bid to push general motors corp. into an alliance with renault-nissan , was chrysler 's largest individual shareholder at the time of the 1998 merger with daimler-benz . he later launched a lawsuit trying to recover billions in damages after he said the companies misled investors about the nature of the deal . dream marriage on the rocks nine years down the line , what was originally billed as a " dream marriage " of daimler and chrysler now appears to be on the rocks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler boss dieter zetsche in what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around , daimlerchrysler unveiled in february plans to slash 13,000 more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary and said it would consider " all options .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reclusive billionaire kerkorian is renowed for deal-making the 89-year-old casino mogul , who failed in his 1995 hostile takeover bid of chrysler , indicated his firm would offer an equity partnership to the united auto workers -lrb- uaw -rrb- and senior management of chrysler as a means of gaining their commitment to his long-term solution . but tracinda said the offer hinges on reaching a deal with daimlerchrysler on sharing chrysler 's massive pension and health care liabilities and getting the uaw to agree to a " new satisfactory collective bargaining agreement " in negotiations this fall . " tracinda believes by taking a long-term approach to solving chrysler 's problems , it can become a robust and lasting , stand-alone entity , " the statement added . daimlerchrysler open to " all options " tracinda offered daimlerchrysler a 100-million dollar deposit in exchange for exclusive due diligence rights , which it said it could complete in 60 days . daimlerchrysler spokesman han tjan declined to comment on the tracinda bid but reiterated chairman dieter zetsche 's statements wednesday confirming that the company is in talks with interested third parties and that " all options " are on the table . a representative from the united auto workers was not immediately available for comment . kerkorian , who last made headlines with his failed bid to push general motors corp. into an alliance with renault-nissan , was chrysler 's largest individual shareholder at the time of the 1998 merger with daimler-benz . he later launched a lawsuit trying to recover billions in damages after he said the companies misled investors about the nature of the deal . dream marriage on the rocks nine years down the line , what was originally billed as a " dream marriage " of daimler and chrysler now appears to be on the rocks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler boss dieter zetsche in what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around , daimlerchrysler unveiled in february plans to slash 13,000 more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary and said it would consider " all options . " chief executive dieter zetsche confirmed wednesday that it was in talks over a possible sale of chrysler but revealed few details at the group 's annual meeting in berlin .
a number of shareholders at the meeting called for a rapid sale . analysts estimate chrysler 's value at between five and seven billion dollars , compared with its purchase price of more than $ 35 billion .
despite a series of restructuring plans , chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year as consumers shied away from the fuel-hungry trucks and sports utility vehicles that had dominated its offerings . the company is reportedly considering firm offers from private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund . the head of the canadian auto workers has expressed a preference for magna out of concern that a private group would be less committed to building the business . kerkorian among wealthiest americans tracinda said in a letter to zetsche that " a private ownership approach is in the best interest of all chrysler constituencies .

but the us , china and russia stand accused of seeking to water down some sections . eu leaders agreed tough targets last month for reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming , with the aim of limiting the rise in temperature to below two degrees celsius , compared to pre-industrial levels . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top expert authority on global warming , said in its report friday that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report was published after all-night negotiations in brussels " the report shows many of the serious impacts that would occur if global warming exceeded the eu 's target of not more than two degrees celsius above the pre-industrial level , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said . " the temperature today is already almost 0.8 degrees celcius above that level , so the world needs to act fast if we are to succeed in stabilizing climate change and thereby prevent its worst impacts , " he said in a statement . global warming to hit europe unevenly the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . global warming will hit europe hard but unevenly this century , cursing the south but giving a mixed blessing to the north , the report said .

" today 's ipcc report spells out very clearly the severe effects that climate change will have on all of us , " dimas said .

but the us , china and russia stand accused of seeking to water down some sections . eu leaders agreed tough targets last month for reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming , with the aim of limiting the rise in temperature to below two degrees celsius , compared to pre-industrial levels . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top expert authority on global warming , said in its report friday that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report was published after all-night negotiations in brussels " the report shows many of the serious impacts that would occur if global warming exceeded the eu 's target of not more than two degrees celsius above the pre-industrial level , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said . " the temperature today is already almost 0.8 degrees celcius above that level , so the world needs to act fast if we are to succeed in stabilizing climate change and thereby prevent its worst impacts , " he said in a statement . global warming to hit europe unevenly the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . global warming will hit europe hard but unevenly this century , cursing the south but giving a mixed blessing to the north , the report said .
mediterranean countries can brace for a higher risk of severe droughts , reduced harvests and deadly heat waves , while high-latitude nations will face flooding and severe weather balanced by longer growing seasons and expanded areas for agriculture and forestry . " today 's ipcc report spells out very clearly the severe effects that climate change will have on all of us , " dimas said .
" this further underlines both how urgent it is to reach global agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and how important it is for us all to adapt to the climate change that is already under way , " he said . us , china try to dilute damning sections of report however , the report - the un 's most toughly-worded warning on climate change as yet - was the subject of fierce disputes in brussels between scientists and governments . gary yohe , one of the report 's lead authors , told reuters that the mood at the conference in brussels was tense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the us he said china , russia and saudi arabia had raised most objections during the night to a 21-page summary which has to be approved unanimously and will guide policy in coming years on issues such as extending the u.n.

finally , one elderly detective decided enough was enough . despite being 95 years old , the silver-haired sleuth not only came up with her own plan to catch the thief but also executed the capture of the felon herself . leaving money out in her room as bait , the nonagenarian crime buster then hid in her toilet and waited .
soon enough , the opportunist crook – a cleaner at the home – came in to swipe the loot , unaware she was being watched by the gray crusader . the old ' cash on the table , hide in the toilet ' trick " then the old lady hit the alarm button in the toilet and staff in the home nabbed the cleaner , " said a police spokesman in the nearby town of saalfeld on thursday .

iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .
" but at the same time if the path changes from the diplomatic path to the path of pressure iran is ready to withstand pressure . " iran 's stance softens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani was the man trusted with breaking the deadlock iran 's arrest of the british sailors on accusations of trespassing on its waters on march 23 was seen by the west as further proof of the islamic republic 's radicalism and intransigence .
but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation .

" german eu presidency hopes for further dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes that a door to dialogue has opened the german statement added that the eu hoped iran would now work with the international community to find solutions in other areas .
in particular it called on iran to " seek a solution to the controversy over the iranian nuclear program through dialogue and negotiation , " in terms of an offer made by the foreign ministers of china , france , germany , russia , britain and the us . while president mahomoud ahmadinejad announced news of the release in a typical coup-de-theatre during a press conference , no such decision is taken without the prior approval of iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . khamenei , an unswerving revolutionary who nonetheless eschews the provocative rhetoric of his president , has the last say on all foreign policy issues in the islamic republic . " the release of the sailors is the work of the leader .
it was he who gave larijani the lead in the talks and took the decision that needed to be taken , " said a western diplomat in tehran , who asked not to be named . coming days after the united nations agreed a second set of sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program , the crisis came at a perilous time for relations between tehran and the west . western powers fear iran is seeking nuclear weapons - a charge vehemently denied by tehran - and the united states has never ruled out the option of military action to bring tehran to heel . iran has already shown a degree of pragmatism in some aspects of the nuclear standoff - most noticeably by the way it failed to carry out threats to sever cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog after the first sanctions resolution . however iran 's nuclear chief ali larijani has told the european union there was no chance tehran would suspend its programme of uranium enrichment , state television reported on thursday .
he made the comments in a telephone conversation on wednesday with the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana .
" the islamic republic of iran is ready to negotiate only on non-diversion -lrb- of its nuclear programme for military purposes -rrb- and not on its nuclear rights , " larijani was quoted as saying by an official of the supreme council for national security , which he heads .
" iran will not accept any preconditions or suspension for a time .
nor can suspending enrichment be a precondition or the result of negotiations " with the five permanent un security council members plus germany , he was quoted as saying . concilliation gives hope in nuclear stand-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad made a theatrical but important speech despite larijani 's defiant comments , mohebian said wednesday 's dramatic events showed that the authorities have no qualms of acting in a conciliatory fashion when the situation requires - something that could have an impact on the nuclear crisis . " the iranian regime is structured in a way that there is a substantial room for maneuver in decision-making .

iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .
" but at the same time if the path changes from the diplomatic path to the path of pressure iran is ready to withstand pressure . " iran 's stance softens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani was the man trusted with breaking the deadlock iran 's arrest of the british sailors on accusations of trespassing on its waters on march 23 was seen by the west as further proof of the islamic republic 's radicalism and intransigence .
but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation . " the german presidency of the european union welcomed the release of the british naval personnel , saying the eu had " repeatedly contacted the iranian authorities to intercede strongly on behalf of the 15 british sailors and marines . " german eu presidency hopes for further dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes that a door to dialogue has opened the german statement added that the eu hoped iran would now work with the international community to find solutions in other areas .
in particular it called on iran to " seek a solution to the controversy over the iranian nuclear program through dialogue and negotiation , " in terms of an offer made by the foreign ministers of china , france , germany , russia , britain and the us . while president mahomoud ahmadinejad announced news of the release in a typical coup-de-theatre during a press conference , no such decision is taken without the prior approval of iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . khamenei , an unswerving revolutionary who nonetheless eschews the provocative rhetoric of his president , has the last say on all foreign policy issues in the islamic republic . " the release of the sailors is the work of the leader .
it was he who gave larijani the lead in the talks and took the decision that needed to be taken , " said a western diplomat in tehran , who asked not to be named . coming days after the united nations agreed a second set of sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program , the crisis came at a perilous time for relations between tehran and the west . western powers fear iran is seeking nuclear weapons - a charge vehemently denied by tehran - and the united states has never ruled out the option of military action to bring tehran to heel . iran has already shown a degree of pragmatism in some aspects of the nuclear standoff - most noticeably by the way it failed to carry out threats to sever cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog after the first sanctions resolution . however iran 's nuclear chief ali larijani has told the european union there was no chance tehran would suspend its programme of uranium enrichment , state television reported on thursday .
he made the comments in a telephone conversation on wednesday with the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana .

" iran 's stance softens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani was the man trusted with breaking the deadlock iran 's arrest of the british sailors on accusations of trespassing on its waters on march 23 was seen by the west as further proof of the islamic republic 's radicalism and intransigence .
but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation . " the german presidency of the european union welcomed the release of the british naval personnel , saying the eu had " repeatedly contacted the iranian authorities to intercede strongly on behalf of the 15 british sailors and marines . " german eu presidency hopes for further dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes that a door to dialogue has opened the german statement added that the eu hoped iran would now work with the international community to find solutions in other areas .
in particular it called on iran to " seek a solution to the controversy over the iranian nuclear program through dialogue and negotiation , " in terms of an offer made by the foreign ministers of china , france , germany , russia , britain and the us . while president mahomoud ahmadinejad announced news of the release in a typical coup-de-theatre during a press conference , no such decision is taken without the prior approval of iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . khamenei , an unswerving revolutionary who nonetheless eschews the provocative rhetoric of his president , has the last say on all foreign policy issues in the islamic republic . " the release of the sailors is the work of the leader .
it was he who gave larijani the lead in the talks and took the decision that needed to be taken , " said a western diplomat in tehran , who asked not to be named . coming days after the united nations agreed a second set of sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program , the crisis came at a perilous time for relations between tehran and the west . western powers fear iran is seeking nuclear weapons - a charge vehemently denied by tehran - and the united states has never ruled out the option of military action to bring tehran to heel . iran has already shown a degree of pragmatism in some aspects of the nuclear standoff - most noticeably by the way it failed to carry out threats to sever cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog after the first sanctions resolution . however iran 's nuclear chief ali larijani has told the european union there was no chance tehran would suspend its programme of uranium enrichment , state television reported on thursday .
he made the comments in a telephone conversation on wednesday with the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana .
" the islamic republic of iran is ready to negotiate only on non-diversion -lrb- of its nuclear programme for military purposes -rrb- and not on its nuclear rights , " larijani was quoted as saying by an official of the supreme council for national security , which he heads .
" iran will not accept any preconditions or suspension for a time .
nor can suspending enrichment be a precondition or the result of negotiations " with the five permanent un security council members plus germany , he was quoted as saying . concilliation gives hope in nuclear stand-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad made a theatrical but important speech despite larijani 's defiant comments , mohebian said wednesday 's dramatic events showed that the authorities have no qualms of acting in a conciliatory fashion when the situation requires - something that could have an impact on the nuclear crisis . " the iranian regime is structured in a way that there is a substantial room for maneuver in decision-making .
although the situation was grave it is ready to make quick decisions in order to cut down the tension , " said mohebian . " this diplomacy can be repeated elsewhere , according to the political situation " said mohebian .
" iran is seeking to change and correct its image worldwide .

it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .
they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .
financial investors go into companies , break up them up and sell the successful parts .
for example the supplier business - the component productions and the press shop and these parts could be sold and purchased by other suppliers .
brands could also be sold - jeep is a very successful brand , others like dodge and chrysler itself are weaker .
they may be sold , for example to chinese carmakers who are strong and looking to capture the american market . ceo dieter zetsche was a hero at daimlerchrysler for a while because of the success of his restructuring program in detroit , although some of the gains he made have not lasted .
do you think will stay on as ceo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes production in bremen - still very profitable i am very sure that he will continue as ceo of daimlerchrysler .
we can see now that zetsche has n't taken one false step in his two years as daimlerchrysler ceo .
he started to fix the quality at mercedes and now they are coming out with new products , such as the e-class .
currently the c-class has been very successful in some markets , like germany .
zetsche is the guy who started thinking about the future of chrysler and the future of mercedes and he started the process of talking to other parties about selling chrysler .
so he has done everything necessary to bring the group back to profit , so from my point of view there is no reason to change management . shareholders have been very unhappy about the company 's performance .
will they be more optimistic now that a sale of chrysler is likely ? i think they can be very optimistic for the future because we think chrsyler will be sold in a few months .
then they will be left with a group which consists of mercedes trucks , which is very strong ; it 's actually the global market leader .
then we have mercedes cars which is becoming stronger and stronger .
by 2009 or 2010 the new e-class will be released and that will be very important for their profitability .
they also have a strong financial services arm which is very successful .
because of these three successful parts we will see stock prices continue to increase , as will the group 's profitability . emma wynne interviewed ferdinand dudenhöffer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.04.2007 daimlerchrysler : " a failed experiment " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel daimler should reach for the skies without chrysler weighing it down professor ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , told dw-world.de that daimlerchrysler has a bright future without the loss making chrysler business . the german-us auto giant officially confirmed on april 4 that it is in talks to sell chrysler amid growing pressure from shareholders .
it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .
they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .
financial investors go into companies , break up them up and sell the successful parts .
for example the supplier business - the component productions and the press shop and these parts could be sold and purchased by other suppliers .
brands could also be sold - jeep is a very successful brand , others like dodge and chrysler itself are weaker .
they may be sold , for example to chinese carmakers who are strong and looking to capture the american market . ceo dieter zetsche was a hero at daimlerchrysler for a while because of the success of his restructuring program in detroit , although some of the gains he made have not lasted .
do you think will stay on as ceo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes production in bremen - still very profitable i am very sure that he will continue as ceo of daimlerchrysler .
we can see now that zetsche has n't taken one false step in his two years as daimlerchrysler ceo .
he started to fix the quality at mercedes and now they are coming out with new products , such as the e-class .
currently the c-class has been very successful in some markets , like germany .
zetsche is the guy who started thinking about the future of chrysler and the future of mercedes and he started the process of talking to other parties about selling chrysler .
so he has done everything necessary to bring the group back to profit , so from my point of view there is no reason to change management . shareholders have been very unhappy about the company 's performance .
will they be more optimistic now that a sale of chrysler is likely ? i think they can be very optimistic for the future because we think chrsyler will be sold in a few months .
then they will be left with a group which consists of mercedes trucks , which is very strong ; it 's actually the global market leader .
then we have mercedes cars which is becoming stronger and stronger .
by 2009 or 2010 the new e-class will be released and that will be very important for their profitability .
they also have a strong financial services arm which is very successful .
because of these three successful parts we will see stock prices continue to increase , as will the group 's profitability . emma wynne interviewed ferdinand dudenhöffer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

german police are also investigating claims a third man was involved in last year 's failed suitcase attack . sweden has extradited a 32-year-old islamist , thaer a , to germany on charges that he is the chief fund-raiser of a new terrorist group planning to operate in sudan , german prosecutors said thursday . the jordanian was arrested on march 19 in sweden and flown to germany on wednesday .

" the report confirms that climate change is a fact , ' merkel told the saturday edition of the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " for that reason we need rapid and decisive action to limit the global rise in temperatures and to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions , " the chancellor said . german environment minister sigmar gabriel demanded putting in place an ambitious program on climate protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has ambitious emission-reduction goals , but can it meet them ?
" this year we have to set course for a multilateral climate protection regime for the period after 2012 , in order to prevent global warming of more than two degrees celsius compared with pre-industrial values , " gabriel said in berlin .
the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . the european union , under the current german presidency , set a goal of cutting co2 emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 at a summit in brussels march 8-9 .
this would be increased to 30 percent , if other major countries followed suit , the member states agreed . germany is hosting the g8 summit in june , where the major industrialized states are expected to put climate change and energy at the top of the agenda . " i will address the theme at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , " merkel told newspaper .
" my aim is to have all nations take on the responsibility for protecting the climate . " variety of voices michael müller , an official in the german environment ministry , described the difficult negotiations leading up to the report as " a mixture of top-level diplomacy and kindergarten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are concerned about the increase in emissions that 's accompanying china 's rapid economic growth the united states , china , saudi arabia and russia had wanted to downgrade human influence on climate change after realizing that climate change " can no longer be denied , " he said . the german environmental organization bund demanded " immediate action to cut greenhouse gas emissions , " urging rich countries to act to limit the effects on poor regions of the world . a spokesman for the german food aid organization welthungerhilfe said the basic human rights of access to food and water would be affected , as the number of people suffering severe water shortage could triple to three billion . power plant plans germany 's green party demanded a halt to plans in germany to build new coal-fired power stations . " in germany we have to address electricity production in particular , as it produces more than 40 per cent of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , ' greens member of parliament bärbel höhn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants are cleaner , but controversial because of safety concerns electricity producers were talking about bringing 40 new coal-fired power plants on line , she said .
if this was implemented , electricity generation would produce 170 million tons of co2 a year , against a total target for germany of 200 million tons , she added . she also questioned the viability of plans to extract co2 from exhaust gases and to store it indefinitely . speaking ahead of the report 's publication , german development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said : " industrialized countries have a responsibility .
they must cut emissions radically . " she called simultaneously for more aid to developing countries , which would suffer the worst effects of climate change .
protecting tropical rainforests should have " absolute priority , " the minister said , adding that up to a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions resulted from the clearing of the rainforests . " i 'm pushing for international financing mechanisms to compensate developing countries for stopping deforestation , " wieczorek-zeul said . international action needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer the former head of the un environment program -lrb- nep -rrb- , klaus töpfer , said a commitment to " drastic international action " was needed .
this was especially the case as the poorest people - primarily in africa - would experience the worst effects .
he was critical of the wrangling over detail in the negotiations leading up to the report 's publication . " one should no longer be fighting over the intensity and probability of climate change , " he said .
" climate change has occurred , it is speeding up , and it is caused by people . " there was a broad movement among ordinary people and business in the united states towards greater climate protection , töpfer said . the chinese leadership had also realized the country needed to emit less co2 . " even in the oil-producing arab countries , there will be rising interest in energy not based on oil , " he predicted . töpfer said the un security council would discuss the issue .
" it is a security issue .

" the report confirms that climate change is a fact , ' merkel told the saturday edition of the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " for that reason we need rapid and decisive action to limit the global rise in temperatures and to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions , " the chancellor said . german environment minister sigmar gabriel demanded putting in place an ambitious program on climate protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has ambitious emission-reduction goals , but can it meet them ?
" this year we have to set course for a multilateral climate protection regime for the period after 2012 , in order to prevent global warming of more than two degrees celsius compared with pre-industrial values , " gabriel said in berlin .
the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . the european union , under the current german presidency , set a goal of cutting co2 emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 at a summit in brussels march 8-9 .
this would be increased to 30 percent , if other major countries followed suit , the member states agreed . germany is hosting the g8 summit in june , where the major industrialized states are expected to put climate change and energy at the top of the agenda . " i will address the theme at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , " merkel told newspaper .
" my aim is to have all nations take on the responsibility for protecting the climate . " variety of voices michael müller , an official in the german environment ministry , described the difficult negotiations leading up to the report as " a mixture of top-level diplomacy and kindergarten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are concerned about the increase in emissions that 's accompanying china 's rapid economic growth the united states , china , saudi arabia and russia had wanted to downgrade human influence on climate change after realizing that climate change " can no longer be denied , " he said . the german environmental organization bund demanded " immediate action to cut greenhouse gas emissions , " urging rich countries to act to limit the effects on poor regions of the world . a spokesman for the german food aid organization welthungerhilfe said the basic human rights of access to food and water would be affected , as the number of people suffering severe water shortage could triple to three billion . power plant plans germany 's green party demanded a halt to plans in germany to build new coal-fired power stations . " in germany we have to address electricity production in particular , as it produces more than 40 per cent of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , ' greens member of parliament bärbel höhn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants are cleaner , but controversial because of safety concerns electricity producers were talking about bringing 40 new coal-fired power plants on line , she said .
if this was implemented , electricity generation would produce 170 million tons of co2 a year , against a total target for germany of 200 million tons , she added . she also questioned the viability of plans to extract co2 from exhaust gases and to store it indefinitely . speaking ahead of the report 's publication , german development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said : " industrialized countries have a responsibility .
they must cut emissions radically . " she called simultaneously for more aid to developing countries , which would suffer the worst effects of climate change .
protecting tropical rainforests should have " absolute priority , " the minister said , adding that up to a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions resulted from the clearing of the rainforests . " i 'm pushing for international financing mechanisms to compensate developing countries for stopping deforestation , " wieczorek-zeul said . international action needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer the former head of the un environment program -lrb- nep -rrb- , klaus töpfer , said a commitment to " drastic international action " was needed .
this was especially the case as the poorest people - primarily in africa - would experience the worst effects .
he was critical of the wrangling over detail in the negotiations leading up to the report 's publication . " one should no longer be fighting over the intensity and probability of climate change , " he said .
" climate change has occurred , it is speeding up , and it is caused by people . " there was a broad movement among ordinary people and business in the united states towards greater climate protection , töpfer said . the chinese leadership had also realized the country needed to emit less co2 . " even in the oil-producing arab countries , there will be rising interest in energy not based on oil , " he predicted . töpfer said the un security council would discuss the issue .
" it is a security issue .

" the report confirms that climate change is a fact , ' merkel told the saturday edition of the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " for that reason we need rapid and decisive action to limit the global rise in temperatures and to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions , " the chancellor said . german environment minister sigmar gabriel demanded putting in place an ambitious program on climate protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has ambitious emission-reduction goals , but can it meet them ?
" this year we have to set course for a multilateral climate protection regime for the period after 2012 , in order to prevent global warming of more than two degrees celsius compared with pre-industrial values , " gabriel said in berlin .
the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . the european union , under the current german presidency , set a goal of cutting co2 emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 at a summit in brussels march 8-9 .
this would be increased to 30 percent , if other major countries followed suit , the member states agreed . germany is hosting the g8 summit in june , where the major industrialized states are expected to put climate change and energy at the top of the agenda . " i will address the theme at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , " merkel told newspaper .
" my aim is to have all nations take on the responsibility for protecting the climate . " variety of voices michael müller , an official in the german environment ministry , described the difficult negotiations leading up to the report as " a mixture of top-level diplomacy and kindergarten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are concerned about the increase in emissions that 's accompanying china 's rapid economic growth the united states , china , saudi arabia and russia had wanted to downgrade human influence on climate change after realizing that climate change " can no longer be denied , " he said . the german environmental organization bund demanded " immediate action to cut greenhouse gas emissions , " urging rich countries to act to limit the effects on poor regions of the world . a spokesman for the german food aid organization welthungerhilfe said the basic human rights of access to food and water would be affected , as the number of people suffering severe water shortage could triple to three billion . power plant plans germany 's green party demanded a halt to plans in germany to build new coal-fired power stations . " in germany we have to address electricity production in particular , as it produces more than 40 per cent of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , ' greens member of parliament bärbel höhn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants are cleaner , but controversial because of safety concerns electricity producers were talking about bringing 40 new coal-fired power plants on line , she said .
if this was implemented , electricity generation would produce 170 million tons of co2 a year , against a total target for germany of 200 million tons , she added . she also questioned the viability of plans to extract co2 from exhaust gases and to store it indefinitely . speaking ahead of the report 's publication , german development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said : " industrialized countries have a responsibility .
they must cut emissions radically . " she called simultaneously for more aid to developing countries , which would suffer the worst effects of climate change .
protecting tropical rainforests should have " absolute priority , " the minister said , adding that up to a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions resulted from the clearing of the rainforests . " i 'm pushing for international financing mechanisms to compensate developing countries for stopping deforestation , " wieczorek-zeul said . international action needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer the former head of the un environment program -lrb- nep -rrb- , klaus töpfer , said a commitment to " drastic international action " was needed .
this was especially the case as the poorest people - primarily in africa - would experience the worst effects .
he was critical of the wrangling over detail in the negotiations leading up to the report 's publication . " one should no longer be fighting over the intensity and probability of climate change , " he said .
" climate change has occurred , it is speeding up , and it is caused by people . " there was a broad movement among ordinary people and business in the united states towards greater climate protection , töpfer said . the chinese leadership had also realized the country needed to emit less co2 . " even in the oil-producing arab countries , there will be rising interest in energy not based on oil , " he predicted . töpfer said the un security council would discuss the issue .

it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .
they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .
financial investors go into companies , break up them up and sell the successful parts .
for example the supplier business - the component productions and the press shop and these parts could be sold and purchased by other suppliers .
brands could also be sold - jeep is a very successful brand , others like dodge and chrysler itself are weaker .
they may be sold , for example to chinese carmakers who are strong and looking to capture the american market . ceo dieter zetsche was a hero at daimlerchrysler for a while because of the success of his restructuring program in detroit , although some of the gains he made have not lasted .
do you think will stay on as ceo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes production in bremen - still very profitable i am very sure that he will continue as ceo of daimlerchrysler .
we can see now that zetsche has n't taken one false step in his two years as daimlerchrysler ceo .
he started to fix the quality at mercedes and now they are coming out with new products , such as the e-class .
currently the c-class has been very successful in some markets , like germany .
zetsche is the guy who started thinking about the future of chrysler and the future of mercedes and he started the process of talking to other parties about selling chrysler .
so he has done everything necessary to bring the group back to profit , so from my point of view there is no reason to change management . shareholders have been very unhappy about the company 's performance .
will they be more optimistic now that a sale of chrysler is likely ? i think they can be very optimistic for the future because we think chrsyler will be sold in a few months .
then they will be left with a group which consists of mercedes trucks , which is very strong ; it 's actually the global market leader .
then we have mercedes cars which is becoming stronger and stronger .
by 2009 or 2010 the new e-class will be released and that will be very important for their profitability .
they also have a strong financial services arm which is very successful .
because of these three successful parts we will see stock prices continue to increase , as will the group 's profitability . emma wynne interviewed ferdinand dudenhöffer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reclusive billionaire kerkorian is renowed for deal-making the 89-year-old casino mogul , who failed in his 1995 hostile takeover bid of chrysler , indicated his firm would offer an equity partnership to the united auto workers -lrb- uaw -rrb- and senior management of chrysler as a means of gaining their commitment to his long-term solution . but tracinda said the offer hinges on reaching a deal with daimlerchrysler on sharing chrysler 's massive pension and health care liabilities and getting the uaw to agree to a " new satisfactory collective bargaining agreement " in negotiations this fall . " tracinda believes by taking a long-term approach to solving chrysler 's problems , it can become a robust and lasting , stand-alone entity , " the statement added . daimlerchrysler open to " all options " tracinda offered daimlerchrysler a 100-million dollar deposit in exchange for exclusive due diligence rights , which it said it could complete in 60 days . daimlerchrysler spokesman han tjan declined to comment on the tracinda bid but reiterated chairman dieter zetsche 's statements wednesday confirming that the company is in talks with interested third parties and that " all options " are on the table . a representative from the united auto workers was not immediately available for comment . kerkorian , who last made headlines with his failed bid to push general motors corp. into an alliance with renault-nissan , was chrysler 's largest individual shareholder at the time of the 1998 merger with daimler-benz . he later launched a lawsuit trying to recover billions in damages after he said the companies misled investors about the nature of the deal . dream marriage on the rocks nine years down the line , what was originally billed as a " dream marriage " of daimler and chrysler now appears to be on the rocks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler boss dieter zetsche in what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around , daimlerchrysler unveiled in february plans to slash 13,000 more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary and said it would consider " all options . " chief executive dieter zetsche confirmed wednesday that it was in talks over a possible sale of chrysler but revealed few details at the group 's annual meeting in berlin .
a number of shareholders at the meeting called for a rapid sale . analysts estimate chrysler 's value at between five and seven billion dollars , compared with its purchase price of more than $ 35 billion .
despite a series of restructuring plans , chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year as consumers shied away from the fuel-hungry trucks and sports utility vehicles that had dominated its offerings . the company is reportedly considering firm offers from private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund . the head of the canadian auto workers has expressed a preference for magna out of concern that a private group would be less committed to building the business . kerkorian among wealthiest americans tracinda said in a letter to zetsche that " a private ownership approach is in the best interest of all chrysler constituencies . " tracinda representative jerry york said it would take five to seven years to rebuild chrysler by shifting the product mix towards " greener " segments , improving product quality to eliminate a consumer bias towards asian products and speeding up the introduction of new models in order to compete with asian automakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an american flag flies outside a merecedes-benz dealership in michigan tracinda 's attempt to get the union to accept an equity stake as a way to diffuse health care costs could bode well for the other us automakers , said jp morgan analyst himanshu patel . " if the uaw proves supportive of tracinda 's bid , we think it could have positive ramifications for gm and ford , as it may signal the union 's willingness to negotiate solutions to healthcare at the upcoming contract renewal talks , " he wrote in a research report . kerkorian was ranked 26th in a forbes magazine list of the wealthiest americans , with a net worth estimated at nine billion dollars .
his chief holding is mgm mirage , which owns about half of the hotel rooms on the las vegas strip . the son of an armenian immigrant , kerkorian grew up in fresno , california .
after dropping out of school , he boxed for a while under the moniker " rifle right , " before joining the royal air force to fly supply planes from canada to britain during world war ii . after the war , his love of flying and risk-taking drew him to las vegas , where the gambling industry was in its infancy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.04.2007 iran 's release of sailors gives hope in nuclear negotiations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the release of the british sailors lead to a breakthrough in the nuclear crisis ?
iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .
" but at the same time if the path changes from the diplomatic path to the path of pressure iran is ready to withstand pressure . " iran 's stance softens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani was the man trusted with breaking the deadlock iran 's arrest of the british sailors on accusations of trespassing on its waters on march 23 was seen by the west as further proof of the islamic republic 's radicalism and intransigence .
but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation . " the german presidency of the european union welcomed the release of the british naval personnel , saying the eu had " repeatedly contacted the iranian authorities to intercede strongly on behalf of the 15 british sailors and marines . " german eu presidency hopes for further dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes that a door to dialogue has opened the german statement added that the eu hoped iran would now work with the international community to find solutions in other areas .
in particular it called on iran to " seek a solution to the controversy over the iranian nuclear program through dialogue and negotiation , " in terms of an offer made by the foreign ministers of china , france , germany , russia , britain and the us . while president mahomoud ahmadinejad announced news of the release in a typical coup-de-theatre during a press conference , no such decision is taken without the prior approval of iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . khamenei , an unswerving revolutionary who nonetheless eschews the provocative rhetoric of his president , has the last say on all foreign policy issues in the islamic republic . " the release of the sailors is the work of the leader .
it was he who gave larijani the lead in the talks and took the decision that needed to be taken , " said a western diplomat in tehran , who asked not to be named . coming days after the united nations agreed a second set of sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program , the crisis came at a perilous time for relations between tehran and the west . western powers fear iran is seeking nuclear weapons - a charge vehemently denied by tehran - and the united states has never ruled out the option of military action to bring tehran to heel . iran has already shown a degree of pragmatism in some aspects of the nuclear standoff - most noticeably by the way it failed to carry out threats to sever cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog after the first sanctions resolution . however iran 's nuclear chief ali larijani has told the european union there was no chance tehran would suspend its programme of uranium enrichment , state television reported on thursday .
he made the comments in a telephone conversation on wednesday with the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana .
" the islamic republic of iran is ready to negotiate only on non-diversion -lrb- of its nuclear programme for military purposes -rrb- and not on its nuclear rights , " larijani was quoted as saying by an official of the supreme council for national security , which he heads .
" iran will not accept any preconditions or suspension for a time .
nor can suspending enrichment be a precondition or the result of negotiations " with the five permanent un security council members plus germany , he was quoted as saying . concilliation gives hope in nuclear stand-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad made a theatrical but important speech despite larijani 's defiant comments , mohebian said wednesday 's dramatic events showed that the authorities have no qualms of acting in a conciliatory fashion when the situation requires - something that could have an impact on the nuclear crisis . " the iranian regime is structured in a way that there is a substantial room for maneuver in decision-making .
although the situation was grave it is ready to make quick decisions in order to cut down the tension , " said mohebian . " this diplomacy can be repeated elsewhere , according to the political situation " said mohebian .

they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .
financial investors go into companies , break up them up and sell the successful parts .
for example the supplier business - the component productions and the press shop and these parts could be sold and purchased by other suppliers .
brands could also be sold - jeep is a very successful brand , others like dodge and chrysler itself are weaker .
they may be sold , for example to chinese carmakers who are strong and looking to capture the american market . ceo dieter zetsche was a hero at daimlerchrysler for a while because of the success of his restructuring program in detroit , although some of the gains he made have not lasted .
do you think will stay on as ceo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes production in bremen - still very profitable i am very sure that he will continue as ceo of daimlerchrysler .
we can see now that zetsche has n't taken one false step in his two years as daimlerchrysler ceo .
he started to fix the quality at mercedes and now they are coming out with new products , such as the e-class .
currently the c-class has been very successful in some markets , like germany .
zetsche is the guy who started thinking about the future of chrysler and the future of mercedes and he started the process of talking to other parties about selling chrysler .
so he has done everything necessary to bring the group back to profit , so from my point of view there is no reason to change management . shareholders have been very unhappy about the company 's performance .
will they be more optimistic now that a sale of chrysler is likely ? i think they can be very optimistic for the future because we think chrsyler will be sold in a few months .
then they will be left with a group which consists of mercedes trucks , which is very strong ; it 's actually the global market leader .
then we have mercedes cars which is becoming stronger and stronger .
by 2009 or 2010 the new e-class will be released and that will be very important for their profitability .
they also have a strong financial services arm which is very successful .
because of these three successful parts we will see stock prices continue to increase , as will the group 's profitability . emma wynne interviewed ferdinand dudenhöffer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .

iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .
" but at the same time if the path changes from the diplomatic path to the path of pressure iran is ready to withstand pressure . " iran 's stance softens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani was the man trusted with breaking the deadlock iran 's arrest of the british sailors on accusations of trespassing on its waters on march 23 was seen by the west as further proof of the islamic republic 's radicalism and intransigence .
but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation . " the german presidency of the european union welcomed the release of the british naval personnel , saying the eu had " repeatedly contacted the iranian authorities to intercede strongly on behalf of the 15 british sailors and marines . " german eu presidency hopes for further dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes that a door to dialogue has opened the german statement added that the eu hoped iran would now work with the international community to find solutions in other areas .
in particular it called on iran to " seek a solution to the controversy over the iranian nuclear program through dialogue and negotiation , " in terms of an offer made by the foreign ministers of china , france , germany , russia , britain and the us . while president mahomoud ahmadinejad announced news of the release in a typical coup-de-theatre during a press conference , no such decision is taken without the prior approval of iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . khamenei , an unswerving revolutionary who nonetheless eschews the provocative rhetoric of his president , has the last say on all foreign policy issues in the islamic republic . " the release of the sailors is the work of the leader .
it was he who gave larijani the lead in the talks and took the decision that needed to be taken , " said a western diplomat in tehran , who asked not to be named . coming days after the united nations agreed a second set of sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program , the crisis came at a perilous time for relations between tehran and the west . western powers fear iran is seeking nuclear weapons - a charge vehemently denied by tehran - and the united states has never ruled out the option of military action to bring tehran to heel . iran has already shown a degree of pragmatism in some aspects of the nuclear standoff - most noticeably by the way it failed to carry out threats to sever cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog after the first sanctions resolution . however iran 's nuclear chief ali larijani has told the european union there was no chance tehran would suspend its programme of uranium enrichment , state television reported on thursday .
he made the comments in a telephone conversation on wednesday with the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana .
" the islamic republic of iran is ready to negotiate only on non-diversion -lrb- of its nuclear programme for military purposes -rrb- and not on its nuclear rights , " larijani was quoted as saying by an official of the supreme council for national security , which he heads .
" iran will not accept any preconditions or suspension for a time .
nor can suspending enrichment be a precondition or the result of negotiations " with the five permanent un security council members plus germany , he was quoted as saying . concilliation gives hope in nuclear stand-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad made a theatrical but important speech despite larijani 's defiant comments , mohebian said wednesday 's dramatic events showed that the authorities have no qualms of acting in a conciliatory fashion when the situation requires - something that could have an impact on the nuclear crisis . " the iranian regime is structured in a way that there is a substantial room for maneuver in decision-making .
although the situation was grave it is ready to make quick decisions in order to cut down the tension , " said mohebian . " this diplomacy can be repeated elsewhere , according to the political situation " said mohebian .
" iran is seeking to change and correct its image worldwide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.04.2007 daimlerchrysler : " a failed experiment " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel daimler should reach for the skies without chrysler weighing it down professor ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , told dw-world.de that daimlerchrysler has a bright future without the loss making chrysler business . the german-us auto giant officially confirmed on april 4 that it is in talks to sell chrysler amid growing pressure from shareholders .
it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .
they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .
financial investors go into companies , break up them up and sell the successful parts .
for example the supplier business - the component productions and the press shop and these parts could be sold and purchased by other suppliers .
brands could also be sold - jeep is a very successful brand , others like dodge and chrysler itself are weaker .
they may be sold , for example to chinese carmakers who are strong and looking to capture the american market . ceo dieter zetsche was a hero at daimlerchrysler for a while because of the success of his restructuring program in detroit , although some of the gains he made have not lasted .
do you think will stay on as ceo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes production in bremen - still very profitable i am very sure that he will continue as ceo of daimlerchrysler .
we can see now that zetsche has n't taken one false step in his two years as daimlerchrysler ceo .
he started to fix the quality at mercedes and now they are coming out with new products , such as the e-class .
currently the c-class has been very successful in some markets , like germany .
zetsche is the guy who started thinking about the future of chrysler and the future of mercedes and he started the process of talking to other parties about selling chrysler .
so he has done everything necessary to bring the group back to profit , so from my point of view there is no reason to change management . shareholders have been very unhappy about the company 's performance .
will they be more optimistic now that a sale of chrysler is likely ? i think they can be very optimistic for the future because we think chrsyler will be sold in a few months .
then they will be left with a group which consists of mercedes trucks , which is very strong ; it 's actually the global market leader .
then we have mercedes cars which is becoming stronger and stronger .
by 2009 or 2010 the new e-class will be released and that will be very important for their profitability .
they also have a strong financial services arm which is very successful .
because of these three successful parts we will see stock prices continue to increase , as will the group 's profitability . emma wynne interviewed ferdinand dudenhöffer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reclusive billionaire kerkorian is renowed for deal-making the 89-year-old casino mogul , who failed in his 1995 hostile takeover bid of chrysler , indicated his firm would offer an equity partnership to the united auto workers -lrb- uaw -rrb- and senior management of chrysler as a means of gaining their commitment to his long-term solution . but tracinda said the offer hinges on reaching a deal with daimlerchrysler on sharing chrysler 's massive pension and health care liabilities and getting the uaw to agree to a " new satisfactory collective bargaining agreement " in negotiations this fall . " tracinda believes by taking a long-term approach to solving chrysler 's problems , it can become a robust and lasting , stand-alone entity , " the statement added . daimlerchrysler open to " all options " tracinda offered daimlerchrysler a 100-million dollar deposit in exchange for exclusive due diligence rights , which it said it could complete in 60 days . daimlerchrysler spokesman han tjan declined to comment on the tracinda bid but reiterated chairman dieter zetsche 's statements wednesday confirming that the company is in talks with interested third parties and that " all options " are on the table . a representative from the united auto workers was not immediately available for comment . kerkorian , who last made headlines with his failed bid to push general motors corp. into an alliance with renault-nissan , was chrysler 's largest individual shareholder at the time of the 1998 merger with daimler-benz . he later launched a lawsuit trying to recover billions in damages after he said the companies misled investors about the nature of the deal . dream marriage on the rocks nine years down the line , what was originally billed as a " dream marriage " of daimler and chrysler now appears to be on the rocks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler boss dieter zetsche in what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around , daimlerchrysler unveiled in february plans to slash 13,000 more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary and said it would consider " all options . " chief executive dieter zetsche confirmed wednesday that it was in talks over a possible sale of chrysler but revealed few details at the group 's annual meeting in berlin .
a number of shareholders at the meeting called for a rapid sale . analysts estimate chrysler 's value at between five and seven billion dollars , compared with its purchase price of more than $ 35 billion .
despite a series of restructuring plans , chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year as consumers shied away from the fuel-hungry trucks and sports utility vehicles that had dominated its offerings . the company is reportedly considering firm offers from private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund . the head of the canadian auto workers has expressed a preference for magna out of concern that a private group would be less committed to building the business . kerkorian among wealthiest americans tracinda said in a letter to zetsche that " a private ownership approach is in the best interest of all chrysler constituencies . " tracinda representative jerry york said it would take five to seven years to rebuild chrysler by shifting the product mix towards " greener " segments , improving product quality to eliminate a consumer bias towards asian products and speeding up the introduction of new models in order to compete with asian automakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an american flag flies outside a merecedes-benz dealership in michigan tracinda 's attempt to get the union to accept an equity stake as a way to diffuse health care costs could bode well for the other us automakers , said jp morgan analyst himanshu patel .

iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .
" but at the same time if the path changes from the diplomatic path to the path of pressure iran is ready to withstand pressure . " iran 's stance softens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani was the man trusted with breaking the deadlock iran 's arrest of the british sailors on accusations of trespassing on its waters on march 23 was seen by the west as further proof of the islamic republic 's radicalism and intransigence .
but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation .

" german eu presidency hopes for further dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes that a door to dialogue has opened the german statement added that the eu hoped iran would now work with the international community to find solutions in other areas .
in particular it called on iran to " seek a solution to the controversy over the iranian nuclear program through dialogue and negotiation , " in terms of an offer made by the foreign ministers of china , france , germany , russia , britain and the us . while president mahomoud ahmadinejad announced news of the release in a typical coup-de-theatre during a press conference , no such decision is taken without the prior approval of iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . khamenei , an unswerving revolutionary who nonetheless eschews the provocative rhetoric of his president , has the last say on all foreign policy issues in the islamic republic . " the release of the sailors is the work of the leader .
it was he who gave larijani the lead in the talks and took the decision that needed to be taken , " said a western diplomat in tehran , who asked not to be named . coming days after the united nations agreed a second set of sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program , the crisis came at a perilous time for relations between tehran and the west . western powers fear iran is seeking nuclear weapons - a charge vehemently denied by tehran - and the united states has never ruled out the option of military action to bring tehran to heel . iran has already shown a degree of pragmatism in some aspects of the nuclear standoff - most noticeably by the way it failed to carry out threats to sever cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog after the first sanctions resolution . however iran 's nuclear chief ali larijani has told the european union there was no chance tehran would suspend its programme of uranium enrichment , state television reported on thursday .
he made the comments in a telephone conversation on wednesday with the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana .
" the islamic republic of iran is ready to negotiate only on non-diversion -lrb- of its nuclear programme for military purposes -rrb- and not on its nuclear rights , " larijani was quoted as saying by an official of the supreme council for national security , which he heads .
" iran will not accept any preconditions or suspension for a time .

iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .
" but at the same time if the path changes from the diplomatic path to the path of pressure iran is ready to withstand pressure . " iran 's stance softens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani was the man trusted with breaking the deadlock iran 's arrest of the british sailors on accusations of trespassing on its waters on march 23 was seen by the west as further proof of the islamic republic 's radicalism and intransigence .
but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation . " the german presidency of the european union welcomed the release of the british naval personnel , saying the eu had " repeatedly contacted the iranian authorities to intercede strongly on behalf of the 15 british sailors and marines .

" tracinda believes by taking a long-term approach to solving chrysler 's problems , it can become a robust and lasting , stand-alone entity , " the statement added . daimlerchrysler open to " all options " tracinda offered daimlerchrysler a 100-million dollar deposit in exchange for exclusive due diligence rights , which it said it could complete in 60 days . daimlerchrysler spokesman han tjan declined to comment on the tracinda bid but reiterated chairman dieter zetsche 's statements wednesday confirming that the company is in talks with interested third parties and that " all options " are on the table . a representative from the united auto workers was not immediately available for comment . kerkorian , who last made headlines with his failed bid to push general motors corp. into an alliance with renault-nissan , was chrysler 's largest individual shareholder at the time of the 1998 merger with daimler-benz . he later launched a lawsuit trying to recover billions in damages after he said the companies misled investors about the nature of the deal . dream marriage on the rocks nine years down the line , what was originally billed as a " dream marriage " of daimler and chrysler now appears to be on the rocks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler boss dieter zetsche in what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around , daimlerchrysler unveiled in february plans to slash 13,000 more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary and said it would consider " all options . " chief executive dieter zetsche confirmed wednesday that it was in talks over a possible sale of chrysler but revealed few details at the group 's annual meeting in berlin .
a number of shareholders at the meeting called for a rapid sale . analysts estimate chrysler 's value at between five and seven billion dollars , compared with its purchase price of more than $ 35 billion .
despite a series of restructuring plans , chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year as consumers shied away from the fuel-hungry trucks and sports utility vehicles that had dominated its offerings . the company is reportedly considering firm offers from private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund . the head of the canadian auto workers has expressed a preference for magna out of concern that a private group would be less committed to building the business . kerkorian among wealthiest americans tracinda said in a letter to zetsche that " a private ownership approach is in the best interest of all chrysler constituencies . " tracinda representative jerry york said it would take five to seven years to rebuild chrysler by shifting the product mix towards " greener " segments , improving product quality to eliminate a consumer bias towards asian products and speeding up the introduction of new models in order to compete with asian automakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an american flag flies outside a merecedes-benz dealership in michigan tracinda 's attempt to get the union to accept an equity stake as a way to diffuse health care costs could bode well for the other us automakers , said jp morgan analyst himanshu patel . " if the uaw proves supportive of tracinda 's bid , we think it could have positive ramifications for gm and ford , as it may signal the union 's willingness to negotiate solutions to healthcare at the upcoming contract renewal talks , " he wrote in a research report . kerkorian was ranked 26th in a forbes magazine list of the wealthiest americans , with a net worth estimated at nine billion dollars .
his chief holding is mgm mirage , which owns about half of the hotel rooms on the las vegas strip . the son of an armenian immigrant , kerkorian grew up in fresno , california .
after dropping out of school , he boxed for a while under the moniker " rifle right , " before joining the royal air force to fly supply planes from canada to britain during world war ii . after the war , his love of flying and risk-taking drew him to las vegas , where the gambling industry was in its infancy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .
" but at the same time if the path changes from the diplomatic path to the path of pressure iran is ready to withstand pressure . " iran 's stance softens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani was the man trusted with breaking the deadlock iran 's arrest of the british sailors on accusations of trespassing on its waters on march 23 was seen by the west as further proof of the islamic republic 's radicalism and intransigence .
but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation .

" german eu presidency hopes for further dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes that a door to dialogue has opened the german statement added that the eu hoped iran would now work with the international community to find solutions in other areas .
in particular it called on iran to " seek a solution to the controversy over the iranian nuclear program through dialogue and negotiation , " in terms of an offer made by the foreign ministers of china , france , germany , russia , britain and the us . while president mahomoud ahmadinejad announced news of the release in a typical coup-de-theatre during a press conference , no such decision is taken without the prior approval of iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . khamenei , an unswerving revolutionary who nonetheless eschews the provocative rhetoric of his president , has the last say on all foreign policy issues in the islamic republic . " the release of the sailors is the work of the leader .
it was he who gave larijani the lead in the talks and took the decision that needed to be taken , " said a western diplomat in tehran , who asked not to be named . coming days after the united nations agreed a second set of sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program , the crisis came at a perilous time for relations between tehran and the west . western powers fear iran is seeking nuclear weapons - a charge vehemently denied by tehran - and the united states has never ruled out the option of military action to bring tehran to heel . iran has already shown a degree of pragmatism in some aspects of the nuclear standoff - most noticeably by the way it failed to carry out threats to sever cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog after the first sanctions resolution . however iran 's nuclear chief ali larijani has told the european union there was no chance tehran would suspend its programme of uranium enrichment , state television reported on thursday .
he made the comments in a telephone conversation on wednesday with the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana .
" the islamic republic of iran is ready to negotiate only on non-diversion -lrb- of its nuclear programme for military purposes -rrb- and not on its nuclear rights , " larijani was quoted as saying by an official of the supreme council for national security , which he heads .
" iran will not accept any preconditions or suspension for a time .

" the report confirms that climate change is a fact , ' merkel told the saturday edition of the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " for that reason we need rapid and decisive action to limit the global rise in temperatures and to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions , " the chancellor said . german environment minister sigmar gabriel demanded putting in place an ambitious program on climate protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has ambitious emission-reduction goals , but can it meet them ?
" this year we have to set course for a multilateral climate protection regime for the period after 2012 , in order to prevent global warming of more than two degrees celsius compared with pre-industrial values , " gabriel said in berlin .
the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . the european union , under the current german presidency , set a goal of cutting co2 emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 at a summit in brussels march 8-9 .
this would be increased to 30 percent , if other major countries followed suit , the member states agreed . germany is hosting the g8 summit in june , where the major industrialized states are expected to put climate change and energy at the top of the agenda . " i will address the theme at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , " merkel told newspaper .
" my aim is to have all nations take on the responsibility for protecting the climate . " variety of voices michael müller , an official in the german environment ministry , described the difficult negotiations leading up to the report as " a mixture of top-level diplomacy and kindergarten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are concerned about the increase in emissions that 's accompanying china 's rapid economic growth the united states , china , saudi arabia and russia had wanted to downgrade human influence on climate change after realizing that climate change " can no longer be denied , " he said . the german environmental organization bund demanded " immediate action to cut greenhouse gas emissions , " urging rich countries to act to limit the effects on poor regions of the world . a spokesman for the german food aid organization welthungerhilfe said the basic human rights of access to food and water would be affected , as the number of people suffering severe water shortage could triple to three billion . power plant plans germany 's green party demanded a halt to plans in germany to build new coal-fired power stations . " in germany we have to address electricity production in particular , as it produces more than 40 per cent of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , ' greens member of parliament bärbel höhn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants are cleaner , but controversial because of safety concerns electricity producers were talking about bringing 40 new coal-fired power plants on line , she said .
if this was implemented , electricity generation would produce 170 million tons of co2 a year , against a total target for germany of 200 million tons , she added . she also questioned the viability of plans to extract co2 from exhaust gases and to store it indefinitely . speaking ahead of the report 's publication , german development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said : " industrialized countries have a responsibility .
they must cut emissions radically . " she called simultaneously for more aid to developing countries , which would suffer the worst effects of climate change .
protecting tropical rainforests should have " absolute priority , " the minister said , adding that up to a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions resulted from the clearing of the rainforests . " i 'm pushing for international financing mechanisms to compensate developing countries for stopping deforestation , " wieczorek-zeul said . international action needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer the former head of the un environment program -lrb- nep -rrb- , klaus töpfer , said a commitment to " drastic international action " was needed .
this was especially the case as the poorest people - primarily in africa - would experience the worst effects .
he was critical of the wrangling over detail in the negotiations leading up to the report 's publication . " one should no longer be fighting over the intensity and probability of climate change , " he said .
" climate change has occurred , it is speeding up , and it is caused by people . " there was a broad movement among ordinary people and business in the united states towards greater climate protection , töpfer said . the chinese leadership had also realized the country needed to emit less co2 . " even in the oil-producing arab countries , there will be rising interest in energy not based on oil , " he predicted . töpfer said the un security council would discuss the issue .

" the report confirms that climate change is a fact , ' merkel told the saturday edition of the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " for that reason we need rapid and decisive action to limit the global rise in temperatures and to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions , " the chancellor said . german environment minister sigmar gabriel demanded putting in place an ambitious program on climate protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has ambitious emission-reduction goals , but can it meet them ?
" this year we have to set course for a multilateral climate protection regime for the period after 2012 , in order to prevent global warming of more than two degrees celsius compared with pre-industrial values , " gabriel said in berlin .
the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . the european union , under the current german presidency , set a goal of cutting co2 emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 at a summit in brussels march 8-9 .
this would be increased to 30 percent , if other major countries followed suit , the member states agreed . germany is hosting the g8 summit in june , where the major industrialized states are expected to put climate change and energy at the top of the agenda . " i will address the theme at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , " merkel told newspaper .
" my aim is to have all nations take on the responsibility for protecting the climate . " variety of voices michael müller , an official in the german environment ministry , described the difficult negotiations leading up to the report as " a mixture of top-level diplomacy and kindergarten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are concerned about the increase in emissions that 's accompanying china 's rapid economic growth the united states , china , saudi arabia and russia had wanted to downgrade human influence on climate change after realizing that climate change " can no longer be denied , " he said . the german environmental organization bund demanded " immediate action to cut greenhouse gas emissions , " urging rich countries to act to limit the effects on poor regions of the world . a spokesman for the german food aid organization welthungerhilfe said the basic human rights of access to food and water would be affected , as the number of people suffering severe water shortage could triple to three billion . power plant plans germany 's green party demanded a halt to plans in germany to build new coal-fired power stations . " in germany we have to address electricity production in particular , as it produces more than 40 per cent of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , ' greens member of parliament bärbel höhn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants are cleaner , but controversial because of safety concerns electricity producers were talking about bringing 40 new coal-fired power plants on line , she said .
if this was implemented , electricity generation would produce 170 million tons of co2 a year , against a total target for germany of 200 million tons , she added . she also questioned the viability of plans to extract co2 from exhaust gases and to store it indefinitely . speaking ahead of the report 's publication , german development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said : " industrialized countries have a responsibility .
they must cut emissions radically . " she called simultaneously for more aid to developing countries , which would suffer the worst effects of climate change .
protecting tropical rainforests should have " absolute priority , " the minister said , adding that up to a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions resulted from the clearing of the rainforests . " i 'm pushing for international financing mechanisms to compensate developing countries for stopping deforestation , " wieczorek-zeul said . international action needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer the former head of the un environment program -lrb- nep -rrb- , klaus töpfer , said a commitment to " drastic international action " was needed .
this was especially the case as the poorest people - primarily in africa - would experience the worst effects .
he was critical of the wrangling over detail in the negotiations leading up to the report 's publication . " one should no longer be fighting over the intensity and probability of climate change , " he said .
" climate change has occurred , it is speeding up , and it is caused by people . " there was a broad movement among ordinary people and business in the united states towards greater climate protection , töpfer said . the chinese leadership had also realized the country needed to emit less co2 . " even in the oil-producing arab countries , there will be rising interest in energy not based on oil , " he predicted . töpfer said the un security council would discuss the issue .
" it is a security issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.04.2007 daimlerchrysler : " a failed experiment " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel daimler should reach for the skies without chrysler weighing it down professor ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , told dw-world.de that daimlerchrysler has a bright future without the loss making chrysler business . the german-us auto giant officially confirmed on april 4 that it is in talks to sell chrysler amid growing pressure from shareholders .
it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .
they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .
financial investors go into companies , break up them up and sell the successful parts .
for example the supplier business - the component productions and the press shop and these parts could be sold and purchased by other suppliers .
brands could also be sold - jeep is a very successful brand , others like dodge and chrysler itself are weaker .
they may be sold , for example to chinese carmakers who are strong and looking to capture the american market . ceo dieter zetsche was a hero at daimlerchrysler for a while because of the success of his restructuring program in detroit , although some of the gains he made have not lasted .
do you think will stay on as ceo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes production in bremen - still very profitable i am very sure that he will continue as ceo of daimlerchrysler .
we can see now that zetsche has n't taken one false step in his two years as daimlerchrysler ceo .
he started to fix the quality at mercedes and now they are coming out with new products , such as the e-class .
currently the c-class has been very successful in some markets , like germany .
zetsche is the guy who started thinking about the future of chrysler and the future of mercedes and he started the process of talking to other parties about selling chrysler .
so he has done everything necessary to bring the group back to profit , so from my point of view there is no reason to change management . shareholders have been very unhappy about the company 's performance .
will they be more optimistic now that a sale of chrysler is likely ? i think they can be very optimistic for the future because we think chrsyler will be sold in a few months .
then they will be left with a group which consists of mercedes trucks , which is very strong ; it 's actually the global market leader .
then we have mercedes cars which is becoming stronger and stronger .
by 2009 or 2010 the new e-class will be released and that will be very important for their profitability .
they also have a strong financial services arm which is very successful .
because of these three successful parts we will see stock prices continue to increase , as will the group 's profitability . emma wynne interviewed ferdinand dudenhöffer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

bremen drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in holland . bayer leverkusen effectively shot themselves in the foot as far as progressing to the uefa cup semi-finals thursday by losing 3-0 at home to spanish side osasuna . the germans ’ quarter-final opponents struck in the opening minute and twice more in a 90 second spell in the second-half for an emphatic triumph which puts the 1988 champions in danger of crashing out unless they can stage a remarkable fight-back in spain next week . javier cueller gave the spaniards a dream start when he headed home a corner kick 55 seconds into the first leg game in germany .
david lopez doubled the lead in the 71st after his first attempt was saved by goalkeeper rene adler . leverkusen 's biggest home defeat in europe was sealed less than two minutes later with a lobbed own goal by pierre webo , who had come on as a substitute just seconds earlier . leverkusen controlled possession but were unable to crack the firm osasuna defense which has allowed just one goal in six uefa cup games . “ things do n't look good for us now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.04.2007 daimlerchrysler : " a failed experiment " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel daimler should reach for the skies without chrysler weighing it down professor ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , told dw-world.de that daimlerchrysler has a bright future without the loss making chrysler business . the german-us auto giant officially confirmed on april 4 that it is in talks to sell chrysler amid growing pressure from shareholders .
it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .
they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .
financial investors go into companies , break up them up and sell the successful parts .
for example the supplier business - the component productions and the press shop and these parts could be sold and purchased by other suppliers .
brands could also be sold - jeep is a very successful brand , others like dodge and chrysler itself are weaker .
they may be sold , for example to chinese carmakers who are strong and looking to capture the american market . ceo dieter zetsche was a hero at daimlerchrysler for a while because of the success of his restructuring program in detroit , although some of the gains he made have not lasted .
do you think will stay on as ceo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes production in bremen - still very profitable i am very sure that he will continue as ceo of daimlerchrysler .
we can see now that zetsche has n't taken one false step in his two years as daimlerchrysler ceo .
he started to fix the quality at mercedes and now they are coming out with new products , such as the e-class .
currently the c-class has been very successful in some markets , like germany .
zetsche is the guy who started thinking about the future of chrysler and the future of mercedes and he started the process of talking to other parties about selling chrysler .
so he has done everything necessary to bring the group back to profit , so from my point of view there is no reason to change management . shareholders have been very unhappy about the company 's performance .
will they be more optimistic now that a sale of chrysler is likely ? i think they can be very optimistic for the future because we think chrsyler will be sold in a few months .
then they will be left with a group which consists of mercedes trucks , which is very strong ; it 's actually the global market leader .
then we have mercedes cars which is becoming stronger and stronger .
by 2009 or 2010 the new e-class will be released and that will be very important for their profitability .
they also have a strong financial services arm which is very successful .
because of these three successful parts we will see stock prices continue to increase , as will the group 's profitability . emma wynne interviewed ferdinand dudenhöffer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .
they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .

" " is it not true that man ... during the full course of his history , finds himself alienated , mangled , abused ? " the pope writes . he also criticizes karl marx for having failed to understand the alienation of man , despite having railed against it , since " he only argues his case in material terms .

" " is it not true that man ... during the full course of his history , finds himself alienated , mangled , abused ? " the pope writes . he also criticizes karl marx for having failed to understand the alienation of man , despite having railed against it , since " he only argues his case in material terms . " " karl marx describes man 's alienation in a drastic way ; although by limiting his reasoning to the material sphere he fails to reach the true depths of alienation , he nevertheless provides a clear image of the man who falls victim to the robbers , " the pope writes . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.04.2007 daimlerchrysler : " a failed experiment " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel daimler should reach for the skies without chrysler weighing it down professor ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , told dw-world.de that daimlerchrysler has a bright future without the loss making chrysler business . the german-us auto giant officially confirmed on april 4 that it is in talks to sell chrysler amid growing pressure from shareholders .
it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .
they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .
financial investors go into companies , break up them up and sell the successful parts .
for example the supplier business - the component productions and the press shop and these parts could be sold and purchased by other suppliers .
brands could also be sold - jeep is a very successful brand , others like dodge and chrysler itself are weaker .
they may be sold , for example to chinese carmakers who are strong and looking to capture the american market . ceo dieter zetsche was a hero at daimlerchrysler for a while because of the success of his restructuring program in detroit , although some of the gains he made have not lasted .
do you think will stay on as ceo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes production in bremen - still very profitable i am very sure that he will continue as ceo of daimlerchrysler .
we can see now that zetsche has n't taken one false step in his two years as daimlerchrysler ceo .
he started to fix the quality at mercedes and now they are coming out with new products , such as the e-class .
currently the c-class has been very successful in some markets , like germany .
zetsche is the guy who started thinking about the future of chrysler and the future of mercedes and he started the process of talking to other parties about selling chrysler .
so he has done everything necessary to bring the group back to profit , so from my point of view there is no reason to change management . shareholders have been very unhappy about the company 's performance .
will they be more optimistic now that a sale of chrysler is likely ? i think they can be very optimistic for the future because we think chrsyler will be sold in a few months .
then they will be left with a group which consists of mercedes trucks , which is very strong ; it 's actually the global market leader .
then we have mercedes cars which is becoming stronger and stronger .
by 2009 or 2010 the new e-class will be released and that will be very important for their profitability .
they also have a strong financial services arm which is very successful .
because of these three successful parts we will see stock prices continue to increase , as will the group 's profitability . emma wynne interviewed ferdinand dudenhöffer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.04.2007 eu says report underscores need to limit global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report predicts that greenhouse gases will accelerate the melting of arctic ice a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .
but the us , china and russia stand accused of seeking to water down some sections . eu leaders agreed tough targets last month for reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming , with the aim of limiting the rise in temperature to below two degrees celsius , compared to pre-industrial levels . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top expert authority on global warming , said in its report friday that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report was published after all-night negotiations in brussels " the report shows many of the serious impacts that would occur if global warming exceeded the eu 's target of not more than two degrees celsius above the pre-industrial level , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said . " the temperature today is already almost 0.8 degrees celcius above that level , so the world needs to act fast if we are to succeed in stabilizing climate change and thereby prevent its worst impacts , " he said in a statement . global warming to hit europe unevenly the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . global warming will hit europe hard but unevenly this century , cursing the south but giving a mixed blessing to the north , the report said .
mediterranean countries can brace for a higher risk of severe droughts , reduced harvests and deadly heat waves , while high-latitude nations will face flooding and severe weather balanced by longer growing seasons and expanded areas for agriculture and forestry . " today 's ipcc report spells out very clearly the severe effects that climate change will have on all of us , " dimas said .
" this further underlines both how urgent it is to reach global agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and how important it is for us all to adapt to the climate change that is already under way , " he said . us , china try to dilute damning sections of report however , the report - the un 's most toughly-worded warning on climate change as yet - was the subject of fierce disputes in brussels between scientists and governments . gary yohe , one of the report 's lead authors , told reuters that the mood at the conference in brussels was tense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the us he said china , russia and saudi arabia had raised most objections during the night to a 21-page summary which has to be approved unanimously and will guide policy in coming years on issues such as extending the u.n. 's kyoto protocol beyond 2012 .
the united states was also reported to be among countries seeking to water down sections about damaging impacts from a warming widely blamed on human use of fossil fuels . some scientists objected , for instance , after china tried to eliminate a note saying that there was " very high confidence " that climate change was already affecting " many natural systems , on all continents and in some oceans . "
china , the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the united states and ahead of russia , wanted no mention of the level of confidence . poor countries most at risk the report underlined that poor tropical countries will be hit worst .
worsening water shortages in thirsty countries , malnutrition caused by desiccated fields , property damage from extreme weather events and the spread of disease by mosquitoes and other vectors will amount to a punishing bill that is beyond the ability of vulnerable countries , especially in africa , to pay . " poor people are the most vulnerable and will be the worst hit by the impacts of climate change .
this becomes a global responsibility , " ipcc 's chairman , rajendra pachauri , said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul repeated the warning in brussels as she reminded western countries that they are responsible for most of the world ’ s climate change .
she said they must do more to help poor countries who are the least responsible yet are most affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister , heidemarie wieczorek-zeul “ our production processes , the way we treat the environment and use our energy : these are a direct , ongoing attack on the basic foundations needed to sustain life , " wieczorek-zeul said . the german minister said industrial nations must do everything possible to protect such regions by lowering emissions . the minister suggested that since 20 to 25 percent of global warming can be traced back to the destruction of tropical rainforests , countries who maintain forests should receive financial assistance . " i suggest , that we set up international financial mechanisms to compensate developing countries who maintain their forests because countries who do that , do something for the world climate , and they ought to be rewarded for their efforts . " leading conservation groups on friday urged an immediate global response to the damning un report . " the urgency of this report , presented by the world 's top scientists , should be matched with an equally urgent response by governments , " said hans verolme , director of the world wildlife fund 's global climate change program . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu 's environmental policy flounders as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.04.2007 after un report , german demands for strong action on climate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brown coal power plant in jänschwalde is among the four dirtiest plants in germany , according to wwf german chancellor angela merkel has called for " decisive action " in a united approach to countering climate change , in an interview following the publication friday of a report by the un panel on climate change . " the report confirms that climate change is a fact , ' merkel told the saturday edition of the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " for that reason we need rapid and decisive action to limit the global rise in temperatures and to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions , " the chancellor said . german environment minister sigmar gabriel demanded putting in place an ambitious program on climate protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has ambitious emission-reduction goals , but can it meet them ?
" this year we have to set course for a multilateral climate protection regime for the period after 2012 , in order to prevent global warming of more than two degrees celsius compared with pre-industrial values , " gabriel said in berlin .
the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . the european union , under the current german presidency , set a goal of cutting co2 emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 at a summit in brussels march 8-9 .
this would be increased to 30 percent , if other major countries followed suit , the member states agreed . germany is hosting the g8 summit in june , where the major industrialized states are expected to put climate change and energy at the top of the agenda . " i will address the theme at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , " merkel told newspaper .
" my aim is to have all nations take on the responsibility for protecting the climate . " variety of voices michael müller , an official in the german environment ministry , described the difficult negotiations leading up to the report as " a mixture of top-level diplomacy and kindergarten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are concerned about the increase in emissions that 's accompanying china 's rapid economic growth the united states , china , saudi arabia and russia had wanted to downgrade human influence on climate change after realizing that climate change " can no longer be denied , " he said . the german environmental organization bund demanded " immediate action to cut greenhouse gas emissions , " urging rich countries to act to limit the effects on poor regions of the world . a spokesman for the german food aid organization welthungerhilfe said the basic human rights of access to food and water would be affected , as the number of people suffering severe water shortage could triple to three billion . power plant plans germany 's green party demanded a halt to plans in germany to build new coal-fired power stations . " in germany we have to address electricity production in particular , as it produces more than 40 per cent of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , ' greens member of parliament bärbel höhn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants are cleaner , but controversial because of safety concerns electricity producers were talking about bringing 40 new coal-fired power plants on line , she said .
if this was implemented , electricity generation would produce 170 million tons of co2 a year , against a total target for germany of 200 million tons , she added . she also questioned the viability of plans to extract co2 from exhaust gases and to store it indefinitely . speaking ahead of the report 's publication , german development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said : " industrialized countries have a responsibility .
they must cut emissions radically . " she called simultaneously for more aid to developing countries , which would suffer the worst effects of climate change .
protecting tropical rainforests should have " absolute priority , " the minister said , adding that up to a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions resulted from the clearing of the rainforests . " i 'm pushing for international financing mechanisms to compensate developing countries for stopping deforestation , " wieczorek-zeul said . international action needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer the former head of the un environment program -lrb- nep -rrb- , klaus töpfer , said a commitment to " drastic international action " was needed .
this was especially the case as the poorest people - primarily in africa - would experience the worst effects .
he was critical of the wrangling over detail in the negotiations leading up to the report 's publication . " one should no longer be fighting over the intensity and probability of climate change , " he said .
" climate change has occurred , it is speeding up , and it is caused by people . " there was a broad movement among ordinary people and business in the united states towards greater climate protection , töpfer said . the chinese leadership had also realized the country needed to emit less co2 . " even in the oil-producing arab countries , there will be rising interest in energy not based on oil , " he predicted . töpfer said the un security council would discuss the issue .
" it is a security issue .

but the us , china and russia stand accused of seeking to water down some sections . eu leaders agreed tough targets last month for reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming , with the aim of limiting the rise in temperature to below two degrees celsius , compared to pre-industrial levels . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top expert authority on global warming , said in its report friday that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report was published after all-night negotiations in brussels " the report shows many of the serious impacts that would occur if global warming exceeded the eu 's target of not more than two degrees celsius above the pre-industrial level , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said . " the temperature today is already almost 0.8 degrees celcius above that level , so the world needs to act fast if we are to succeed in stabilizing climate change and thereby prevent its worst impacts , " he said in a statement . global warming to hit europe unevenly the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . global warming will hit europe hard but unevenly this century , cursing the south but giving a mixed blessing to the north , the report said .
mediterranean countries can brace for a higher risk of severe droughts , reduced harvests and deadly heat waves , while high-latitude nations will face flooding and severe weather balanced by longer growing seasons and expanded areas for agriculture and forestry . " today 's ipcc report spells out very clearly the severe effects that climate change will have on all of us , " dimas said .
" this further underlines both how urgent it is to reach global agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and how important it is for us all to adapt to the climate change that is already under way , " he said . us , china try to dilute damning sections of report however , the report - the un 's most toughly-worded warning on climate change as yet - was the subject of fierce disputes in brussels between scientists and governments . gary yohe , one of the report 's lead authors , told reuters that the mood at the conference in brussels was tense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the us he said china , russia and saudi arabia had raised most objections during the night to a 21-page summary which has to be approved unanimously and will guide policy in coming years on issues such as extending the u.n. 's kyoto protocol beyond 2012 .
the united states was also reported to be among countries seeking to water down sections about damaging impacts from a warming widely blamed on human use of fossil fuels . some scientists objected , for instance , after china tried to eliminate a note saying that there was " very high confidence " that climate change was already affecting " many natural systems , on all continents and in some oceans . "
china , the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the united states and ahead of russia , wanted no mention of the level of confidence . poor countries most at risk the report underlined that poor tropical countries will be hit worst .
worsening water shortages in thirsty countries , malnutrition caused by desiccated fields , property damage from extreme weather events and the spread of disease by mosquitoes and other vectors will amount to a punishing bill that is beyond the ability of vulnerable countries , especially in africa , to pay . " poor people are the most vulnerable and will be the worst hit by the impacts of climate change .
this becomes a global responsibility , " ipcc 's chairman , rajendra pachauri , said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul repeated the warning in brussels as she reminded western countries that they are responsible for most of the world ’ s climate change .
she said they must do more to help poor countries who are the least responsible yet are most affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister , heidemarie wieczorek-zeul “ our production processes , the way we treat the environment and use our energy : these are a direct , ongoing attack on the basic foundations needed to sustain life , " wieczorek-zeul said . the german minister said industrial nations must do everything possible to protect such regions by lowering emissions . the minister suggested that since 20 to 25 percent of global warming can be traced back to the destruction of tropical rainforests , countries who maintain forests should receive financial assistance . " i suggest , that we set up international financial mechanisms to compensate developing countries who maintain their forests because countries who do that , do something for the world climate , and they ought to be rewarded for their efforts . " leading conservation groups on friday urged an immediate global response to the damning un report . " the urgency of this report , presented by the world 's top scientists , should be matched with an equally urgent response by governments , " said hans verolme , director of the world wildlife fund 's global climate change program . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu 's environmental policy flounders as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering .

bremen drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in holland . bayer leverkusen effectively shot themselves in the foot as far as progressing to the uefa cup semi-finals thursday by losing 3-0 at home to spanish side osasuna . the germans ’ quarter-final opponents struck in the opening minute and twice more in a 90 second spell in the second-half for an emphatic triumph which puts the 1988 champions in danger of crashing out unless they can stage a remarkable fight-back in spain next week . javier cueller gave the spaniards a dream start when he headed home a corner kick 55 seconds into the first leg game in germany .
david lopez doubled the lead in the 71st after his first attempt was saved by goalkeeper rene adler . leverkusen 's biggest home defeat in europe was sealed less than two minutes later with a lobbed own goal by pierre webo , who had come on as a substitute just seconds earlier . leverkusen controlled possession but were unable to crack the firm osasuna defense which has allowed just one goal in six uefa cup games . “ things do n't look good for us now .
we did n't play up to our potential while they were good on the counter and deserved to win , ” said leverkusen 's germany midfielder bernd schneider . lopez and enrique coralles will miss the return leg at home after being booked for time-wasting , but the match next thursday appears a mere formality for osasuna , who are one of three spanish clubs in the final eight . werder still in with a shot werder bremen , the other german side still in the uefa cup , faced their second dutch side in as many rounds as they traveled to az alkmaar . bremen fought to a difficult 0-0 draw which extended the dutch side 's unbeaten run at home to 30 games since they entered european competition in 1977 . coached by former barcelona and holland manager louis van gaal , alkmaar went into the match as the competition 's top scorers this season but a resolute bremen defense kept the free-scoring dutch at bay – and nearly grabbed themselves a valuable away goal in the process . clemens fritz had the germans ’ best chance when he sprinted onto a defense-splitting back-heel from playmaker diego but his shot was well saved . alkmaar started slowly and their first chance came on the half-hour when winger julian jenner crossed for maarten martens but his header was turned over the bar by bremen goalkeeper tim wiese . the second-half was much livelier with werder ’ s left back pierre wome and diego both denied by great saves by az goalie boy waterman . tim wiese was also busy at the other end ; the best save of the half coming when he smothered a close range attempt from belgian striker moussa dembele . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german teams make two-sided attack on uefa cup both bremen and leverkusen grabbed wins in the second leg of their uefa cup matches to advance to the quarterfinals .

" tracinda believes by taking a long-term approach to solving chrysler 's problems , it can become a robust and lasting , stand-alone entity , " the statement added . daimlerchrysler open to " all options " tracinda offered daimlerchrysler a 100-million dollar deposit in exchange for exclusive due diligence rights , which it said it could complete in 60 days . daimlerchrysler spokesman han tjan declined to comment on the tracinda bid but reiterated chairman dieter zetsche 's statements wednesday confirming that the company is in talks with interested third parties and that " all options " are on the table . a representative from the united auto workers was not immediately available for comment . kerkorian , who last made headlines with his failed bid to push general motors corp. into an alliance with renault-nissan , was chrysler 's largest individual shareholder at the time of the 1998 merger with daimler-benz . he later launched a lawsuit trying to recover billions in damages after he said the companies misled investors about the nature of the deal . dream marriage on the rocks nine years down the line , what was originally billed as a " dream marriage " of daimler and chrysler now appears to be on the rocks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler boss dieter zetsche in what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around , daimlerchrysler unveiled in february plans to slash 13,000 more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary and said it would consider " all options . " chief executive dieter zetsche confirmed wednesday that it was in talks over a possible sale of chrysler but revealed few details at the group 's annual meeting in berlin .
a number of shareholders at the meeting called for a rapid sale . analysts estimate chrysler 's value at between five and seven billion dollars , compared with its purchase price of more than $ 35 billion .
despite a series of restructuring plans , chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year as consumers shied away from the fuel-hungry trucks and sports utility vehicles that had dominated its offerings . the company is reportedly considering firm offers from private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund . the head of the canadian auto workers has expressed a preference for magna out of concern that a private group would be less committed to building the business . kerkorian among wealthiest americans tracinda said in a letter to zetsche that " a private ownership approach is in the best interest of all chrysler constituencies . " tracinda representative jerry york said it would take five to seven years to rebuild chrysler by shifting the product mix towards " greener " segments , improving product quality to eliminate a consumer bias towards asian products and speeding up the introduction of new models in order to compete with asian automakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an american flag flies outside a merecedes-benz dealership in michigan tracinda 's attempt to get the union to accept an equity stake as a way to diffuse health care costs could bode well for the other us automakers , said jp morgan analyst himanshu patel .

his chief holding is mgm mirage , which owns about half of the hotel rooms on the las vegas strip . the son of an armenian immigrant , kerkorian grew up in fresno , california .
after dropping out of school , he boxed for a while under the moniker " rifle right , " before joining the royal air force to fly supply planes from canada to britain during world war ii . after the war , his love of flying and risk-taking drew him to las vegas , where the gambling industry was in its infancy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.04.2007 eu says report underscores need to limit global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report predicts that greenhouse gases will accelerate the melting of arctic ice a major un report on the potentially devastating effects of global warming provides new evidence for the need to limit climate change .
but the us , china and russia stand accused of seeking to water down some sections . eu leaders agreed tough targets last month for reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming , with the aim of limiting the rise in temperature to below two degrees celsius , compared to pre-industrial levels . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top expert authority on global warming , said in its report friday that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report was published after all-night negotiations in brussels " the report shows many of the serious impacts that would occur if global warming exceeded the eu 's target of not more than two degrees celsius above the pre-industrial level , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said . " the temperature today is already almost 0.8 degrees celcius above that level , so the world needs to act fast if we are to succeed in stabilizing climate change and thereby prevent its worst impacts , " he said in a statement . global warming to hit europe unevenly the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . global warming will hit europe hard but unevenly this century , cursing the south but giving a mixed blessing to the north , the report said .
mediterranean countries can brace for a higher risk of severe droughts , reduced harvests and deadly heat waves , while high-latitude nations will face flooding and severe weather balanced by longer growing seasons and expanded areas for agriculture and forestry . " today 's ipcc report spells out very clearly the severe effects that climate change will have on all of us , " dimas said .
" this further underlines both how urgent it is to reach global agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and how important it is for us all to adapt to the climate change that is already under way , " he said . us , china try to dilute damning sections of report however , the report - the un 's most toughly-worded warning on climate change as yet - was the subject of fierce disputes in brussels between scientists and governments . gary yohe , one of the report 's lead authors , told reuters that the mood at the conference in brussels was tense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the us he said china , russia and saudi arabia had raised most objections during the night to a 21-page summary which has to be approved unanimously and will guide policy in coming years on issues such as extending the u.n. 's kyoto protocol beyond 2012 .
the united states was also reported to be among countries seeking to water down sections about damaging impacts from a warming widely blamed on human use of fossil fuels . some scientists objected , for instance , after china tried to eliminate a note saying that there was " very high confidence " that climate change was already affecting " many natural systems , on all continents and in some oceans . "
china , the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the united states and ahead of russia , wanted no mention of the level of confidence . poor countries most at risk the report underlined that poor tropical countries will be hit worst .
worsening water shortages in thirsty countries , malnutrition caused by desiccated fields , property damage from extreme weather events and the spread of disease by mosquitoes and other vectors will amount to a punishing bill that is beyond the ability of vulnerable countries , especially in africa , to pay . " poor people are the most vulnerable and will be the worst hit by the impacts of climate change .
this becomes a global responsibility , " ipcc 's chairman , rajendra pachauri , said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul repeated the warning in brussels as she reminded western countries that they are responsible for most of the world ’ s climate change .
she said they must do more to help poor countries who are the least responsible yet are most affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister , heidemarie wieczorek-zeul “ our production processes , the way we treat the environment and use our energy : these are a direct , ongoing attack on the basic foundations needed to sustain life , " wieczorek-zeul said . the german minister said industrial nations must do everything possible to protect such regions by lowering emissions . the minister suggested that since 20 to 25 percent of global warming can be traced back to the destruction of tropical rainforests , countries who maintain forests should receive financial assistance . " i suggest , that we set up international financial mechanisms to compensate developing countries who maintain their forests because countries who do that , do something for the world climate , and they ought to be rewarded for their efforts . " leading conservation groups on friday urged an immediate global response to the damning un report . " the urgency of this report , presented by the world 's top scientists , should be matched with an equally urgent response by governments , " said hans verolme , director of the world wildlife fund 's global climate change program . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu 's environmental policy flounders as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .

bremen drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in holland . bayer leverkusen effectively shot themselves in the foot as far as progressing to the uefa cup semi-finals thursday by losing 3-0 at home to spanish side osasuna . the germans ’ quarter-final opponents struck in the opening minute and twice more in a 90 second spell in the second-half for an emphatic triumph which puts the 1988 champions in danger of crashing out unless they can stage a remarkable fight-back in spain next week . javier cueller gave the spaniards a dream start when he headed home a corner kick 55 seconds into the first leg game in germany .
david lopez doubled the lead in the 71st after his first attempt was saved by goalkeeper rene adler . leverkusen 's biggest home defeat in europe was sealed less than two minutes later with a lobbed own goal by pierre webo , who had come on as a substitute just seconds earlier . leverkusen controlled possession but were unable to crack the firm osasuna defense which has allowed just one goal in six uefa cup games . “ things do n't look good for us now .
we did n't play up to our potential while they were good on the counter and deserved to win , ” said leverkusen 's germany midfielder bernd schneider . lopez and enrique coralles will miss the return leg at home after being booked for time-wasting , but the match next thursday appears a mere formality for osasuna , who are one of three spanish clubs in the final eight . werder still in with a shot werder bremen , the other german side still in the uefa cup , faced their second dutch side in as many rounds as they traveled to az alkmaar . bremen fought to a difficult 0-0 draw which extended the dutch side 's unbeaten run at home to 30 games since they entered european competition in 1977 . coached by former barcelona and holland manager louis van gaal , alkmaar went into the match as the competition 's top scorers this season but a resolute bremen defense kept the free-scoring dutch at bay – and nearly grabbed themselves a valuable away goal in the process . clemens fritz had the germans ’ best chance when he sprinted onto a defense-splitting back-heel from playmaker diego but his shot was well saved . alkmaar started slowly and their first chance came on the half-hour when winger julian jenner crossed for maarten martens but his header was turned over the bar by bremen goalkeeper tim wiese . the second-half was much livelier with werder ’ s left back pierre wome and diego both denied by great saves by az goalie boy waterman . tim wiese was also busy at the other end ; the best save of the half coming when he smothered a close range attempt from belgian striker moussa dembele . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german teams make two-sided attack on uefa cup both bremen and leverkusen grabbed wins in the second leg of their uefa cup matches to advance to the quarterfinals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.04.2007 iran 's release of sailors gives hope in nuclear negotiations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the release of the british sailors lead to a breakthrough in the nuclear crisis ?
iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .
" but at the same time if the path changes from the diplomatic path to the path of pressure iran is ready to withstand pressure . " iran 's stance softens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani was the man trusted with breaking the deadlock iran 's arrest of the british sailors on accusations of trespassing on its waters on march 23 was seen by the west as further proof of the islamic republic 's radicalism and intransigence .
but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation . " the german presidency of the european union welcomed the release of the british naval personnel , saying the eu had " repeatedly contacted the iranian authorities to intercede strongly on behalf of the 15 british sailors and marines . " german eu presidency hopes for further dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes that a door to dialogue has opened the german statement added that the eu hoped iran would now work with the international community to find solutions in other areas .
in particular it called on iran to " seek a solution to the controversy over the iranian nuclear program through dialogue and negotiation , " in terms of an offer made by the foreign ministers of china , france , germany , russia , britain and the us . while president mahomoud ahmadinejad announced news of the release in a typical coup-de-theatre during a press conference , no such decision is taken without the prior approval of iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . khamenei , an unswerving revolutionary who nonetheless eschews the provocative rhetoric of his president , has the last say on all foreign policy issues in the islamic republic . " the release of the sailors is the work of the leader .
it was he who gave larijani the lead in the talks and took the decision that needed to be taken , " said a western diplomat in tehran , who asked not to be named . coming days after the united nations agreed a second set of sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program , the crisis came at a perilous time for relations between tehran and the west . western powers fear iran is seeking nuclear weapons - a charge vehemently denied by tehran - and the united states has never ruled out the option of military action to bring tehran to heel . iran has already shown a degree of pragmatism in some aspects of the nuclear standoff - most noticeably by the way it failed to carry out threats to sever cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog after the first sanctions resolution . however iran 's nuclear chief ali larijani has told the european union there was no chance tehran would suspend its programme of uranium enrichment , state television reported on thursday .
he made the comments in a telephone conversation on wednesday with the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana .
" the islamic republic of iran is ready to negotiate only on non-diversion -lrb- of its nuclear programme for military purposes -rrb- and not on its nuclear rights , " larijani was quoted as saying by an official of the supreme council for national security , which he heads .

iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .
" but at the same time if the path changes from the diplomatic path to the path of pressure iran is ready to withstand pressure . " iran 's stance softens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani was the man trusted with breaking the deadlock iran 's arrest of the british sailors on accusations of trespassing on its waters on march 23 was seen by the west as further proof of the islamic republic 's radicalism and intransigence .
but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation . " the german presidency of the european union welcomed the release of the british naval personnel , saying the eu had " repeatedly contacted the iranian authorities to intercede strongly on behalf of the 15 british sailors and marines . " german eu presidency hopes for further dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes that a door to dialogue has opened the german statement added that the eu hoped iran would now work with the international community to find solutions in other areas .
in particular it called on iran to " seek a solution to the controversy over the iranian nuclear program through dialogue and negotiation , " in terms of an offer made by the foreign ministers of china , france , germany , russia , britain and the us . while president mahomoud ahmadinejad announced news of the release in a typical coup-de-theatre during a press conference , no such decision is taken without the prior approval of iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . khamenei , an unswerving revolutionary who nonetheless eschews the provocative rhetoric of his president , has the last say on all foreign policy issues in the islamic republic . " the release of the sailors is the work of the leader .
it was he who gave larijani the lead in the talks and took the decision that needed to be taken , " said a western diplomat in tehran , who asked not to be named . coming days after the united nations agreed a second set of sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program , the crisis came at a perilous time for relations between tehran and the west . western powers fear iran is seeking nuclear weapons - a charge vehemently denied by tehran - and the united states has never ruled out the option of military action to bring tehran to heel . iran has already shown a degree of pragmatism in some aspects of the nuclear standoff - most noticeably by the way it failed to carry out threats to sever cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog after the first sanctions resolution . however iran 's nuclear chief ali larijani has told the european union there was no chance tehran would suspend its programme of uranium enrichment , state television reported on thursday .
he made the comments in a telephone conversation on wednesday with the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana .
" the islamic republic of iran is ready to negotiate only on non-diversion -lrb- of its nuclear programme for military purposes -rrb- and not on its nuclear rights , " larijani was quoted as saying by an official of the supreme council for national security , which he heads .
" iran will not accept any preconditions or suspension for a time .

but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation . " the german presidency of the european union welcomed the release of the british naval personnel , saying the eu had " repeatedly contacted the iranian authorities to intercede strongly on behalf of the 15 british sailors and marines . " german eu presidency hopes for further dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes that a door to dialogue has opened the german statement added that the eu hoped iran would now work with the international community to find solutions in other areas .
in particular it called on iran to " seek a solution to the controversy over the iranian nuclear program through dialogue and negotiation , " in terms of an offer made by the foreign ministers of china , france , germany , russia , britain and the us . while president mahomoud ahmadinejad announced news of the release in a typical coup-de-theatre during a press conference , no such decision is taken without the prior approval of iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . khamenei , an unswerving revolutionary who nonetheless eschews the provocative rhetoric of his president , has the last say on all foreign policy issues in the islamic republic . " the release of the sailors is the work of the leader .
it was he who gave larijani the lead in the talks and took the decision that needed to be taken , " said a western diplomat in tehran , who asked not to be named . coming days after the united nations agreed a second set of sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program , the crisis came at a perilous time for relations between tehran and the west . western powers fear iran is seeking nuclear weapons - a charge vehemently denied by tehran - and the united states has never ruled out the option of military action to bring tehran to heel . iran has already shown a degree of pragmatism in some aspects of the nuclear standoff - most noticeably by the way it failed to carry out threats to sever cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog after the first sanctions resolution . however iran 's nuclear chief ali larijani has told the european union there was no chance tehran would suspend its programme of uranium enrichment , state television reported on thursday .
he made the comments in a telephone conversation on wednesday with the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana .
" the islamic republic of iran is ready to negotiate only on non-diversion -lrb- of its nuclear programme for military purposes -rrb- and not on its nuclear rights , " larijani was quoted as saying by an official of the supreme council for national security , which he heads .
" iran will not accept any preconditions or suspension for a time .
nor can suspending enrichment be a precondition or the result of negotiations " with the five permanent un security council members plus germany , he was quoted as saying . concilliation gives hope in nuclear stand-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad made a theatrical but important speech despite larijani 's defiant comments , mohebian said wednesday 's dramatic events showed that the authorities have no qualms of acting in a conciliatory fashion when the situation requires - something that could have an impact on the nuclear crisis . " the iranian regime is structured in a way that there is a substantial room for maneuver in decision-making .
although the situation was grave it is ready to make quick decisions in order to cut down the tension , " said mohebian . " this diplomacy can be repeated elsewhere , according to the political situation " said mohebian .
" iran is seeking to change and correct its image worldwide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 06.04.2007 daimlerchrysler : " a failed experiment " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel daimler should reach for the skies without chrysler weighing it down professor ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , told dw-world.de that daimlerchrysler has a bright future without the loss making chrysler business . the german-us auto giant officially confirmed on april 4 that it is in talks to sell chrysler amid growing pressure from shareholders .
it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .
they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .
financial investors go into companies , break up them up and sell the successful parts .
for example the supplier business - the component productions and the press shop and these parts could be sold and purchased by other suppliers .
brands could also be sold - jeep is a very successful brand , others like dodge and chrysler itself are weaker .
they may be sold , for example to chinese carmakers who are strong and looking to capture the american market . ceo dieter zetsche was a hero at daimlerchrysler for a while because of the success of his restructuring program in detroit , although some of the gains he made have not lasted .
do you think will stay on as ceo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes production in bremen - still very profitable i am very sure that he will continue as ceo of daimlerchrysler .
we can see now that zetsche has n't taken one false step in his two years as daimlerchrysler ceo .
he started to fix the quality at mercedes and now they are coming out with new products , such as the e-class .
currently the c-class has been very successful in some markets , like germany .
zetsche is the guy who started thinking about the future of chrysler and the future of mercedes and he started the process of talking to other parties about selling chrysler .
so he has done everything necessary to bring the group back to profit , so from my point of view there is no reason to change management . shareholders have been very unhappy about the company 's performance .
will they be more optimistic now that a sale of chrysler is likely ? i think they can be very optimistic for the future because we think chrsyler will be sold in a few months .
then they will be left with a group which consists of mercedes trucks , which is very strong ; it 's actually the global market leader .
then we have mercedes cars which is becoming stronger and stronger .
by 2009 or 2010 the new e-class will be released and that will be very important for their profitability .
they also have a strong financial services arm which is very successful .
because of these three successful parts we will see stock prices continue to increase , as will the group 's profitability . emma wynne interviewed ferdinand dudenhöffer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .

iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .

" the report confirms that climate change is a fact , ' merkel told the saturday edition of the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " for that reason we need rapid and decisive action to limit the global rise in temperatures and to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions , " the chancellor said . german environment minister sigmar gabriel demanded putting in place an ambitious program on climate protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has ambitious emission-reduction goals , but can it meet them ?
" this year we have to set course for a multilateral climate protection regime for the period after 2012 , in order to prevent global warming of more than two degrees celsius compared with pre-industrial values , " gabriel said in berlin .
the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . the european union , under the current german presidency , set a goal of cutting co2 emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 at a summit in brussels march 8-9 .
this would be increased to 30 percent , if other major countries followed suit , the member states agreed . germany is hosting the g8 summit in june , where the major industrialized states are expected to put climate change and energy at the top of the agenda . " i will address the theme at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , " merkel told newspaper .
" my aim is to have all nations take on the responsibility for protecting the climate . " variety of voices michael müller , an official in the german environment ministry , described the difficult negotiations leading up to the report as " a mixture of top-level diplomacy and kindergarten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are concerned about the increase in emissions that 's accompanying china 's rapid economic growth the united states , china , saudi arabia and russia had wanted to downgrade human influence on climate change after realizing that climate change " can no longer be denied , " he said . the german environmental organization bund demanded " immediate action to cut greenhouse gas emissions , " urging rich countries to act to limit the effects on poor regions of the world . a spokesman for the german food aid organization welthungerhilfe said the basic human rights of access to food and water would be affected , as the number of people suffering severe water shortage could triple to three billion . power plant plans germany 's green party demanded a halt to plans in germany to build new coal-fired power stations . " in germany we have to address electricity production in particular , as it produces more than 40 per cent of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , ' greens member of parliament bärbel höhn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants are cleaner , but controversial because of safety concerns electricity producers were talking about bringing 40 new coal-fired power plants on line , she said .
if this was implemented , electricity generation would produce 170 million tons of co2 a year , against a total target for germany of 200 million tons , she added . she also questioned the viability of plans to extract co2 from exhaust gases and to store it indefinitely . speaking ahead of the report 's publication , german development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said : " industrialized countries have a responsibility .
they must cut emissions radically . " she called simultaneously for more aid to developing countries , which would suffer the worst effects of climate change .
protecting tropical rainforests should have " absolute priority , " the minister said , adding that up to a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions resulted from the clearing of the rainforests . " i 'm pushing for international financing mechanisms to compensate developing countries for stopping deforestation , " wieczorek-zeul said . international action needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer the former head of the un environment program -lrb- nep -rrb- , klaus töpfer , said a commitment to " drastic international action " was needed .
this was especially the case as the poorest people - primarily in africa - would experience the worst effects .
he was critical of the wrangling over detail in the negotiations leading up to the report 's publication . " one should no longer be fighting over the intensity and probability of climate change , " he said .
" climate change has occurred , it is speeding up , and it is caused by people . " there was a broad movement among ordinary people and business in the united states towards greater climate protection , töpfer said . the chinese leadership had also realized the country needed to emit less co2 . " even in the oil-producing arab countries , there will be rising interest in energy not based on oil , " he predicted . töpfer said the un security council would discuss the issue .

iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off . the shock release of the british sailors shows iran is willing to consider pragmatism over radicalism and steer clear of an all-out confrontation with the west , analysts said thursday . it remains to be seen what impact the release of the sailors will have on the much longer running crisis of iran 's nuclear standoff , but analysts said it creates hope that a deal can still be reached despite months of stalemate . " it shows iran 's pragmatism , " said analyst mohammed sadeq al-husseini , who is close to former president mohammad khatami . " it shows that iran does not seek confrontation with the west and is also a wise step towards a peaceful solution for the most critical issue of the middle east region , which is the iranian nuclear issue . " this is a correct , direct and frank signal .
and it has a clear message for britain and the united states and even for the iranians that this is the solution , since the middle east can not bear another conflict , " he said . " with this action , iran sent a signal that it is ready to sort out its issues through diplomatic means , " said conservative analyst amir mohebian .
" but at the same time if the path changes from the diplomatic path to the path of pressure iran is ready to withstand pressure . " iran 's stance softens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani was the man trusted with breaking the deadlock iran 's arrest of the british sailors on accusations of trespassing on its waters on march 23 was seen by the west as further proof of the islamic republic 's radicalism and intransigence .
but as the crisis went on , the statements from tehran became milder with top security official ali larijani giving an interview to british television in which he said the crisis was eminently resolvable . and while tehran showed it is unafraid of saber-rattling by capturing the sailors in the first place , in the end they were released amid smiles after a relatively short two-week period in detention . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday described the release of the sailors as a " start ... -lrb- which -rrb- will open the door to further cooperation . " the german presidency of the european union welcomed the release of the british naval personnel , saying the eu had " repeatedly contacted the iranian authorities to intercede strongly on behalf of the 15 british sailors and marines . " german eu presidency hopes for further dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes that a door to dialogue has opened the german statement added that the eu hoped iran would now work with the international community to find solutions in other areas .
in particular it called on iran to " seek a solution to the controversy over the iranian nuclear program through dialogue and negotiation , " in terms of an offer made by the foreign ministers of china , france , germany , russia , britain and the us . while president mahomoud ahmadinejad announced news of the release in a typical coup-de-theatre during a press conference , no such decision is taken without the prior approval of iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . khamenei , an unswerving revolutionary who nonetheless eschews the provocative rhetoric of his president , has the last say on all foreign policy issues in the islamic republic .

" the temperature today is already almost 0.8 degrees celcius above that level , so the world needs to act fast if we are to succeed in stabilizing climate change and thereby prevent its worst impacts , " he said in a statement . global warming to hit europe unevenly the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . global warming will hit europe hard but unevenly this century , cursing the south but giving a mixed blessing to the north , the report said .
mediterranean countries can brace for a higher risk of severe droughts , reduced harvests and deadly heat waves , while high-latitude nations will face flooding and severe weather balanced by longer growing seasons and expanded areas for agriculture and forestry . " today 's ipcc report spells out very clearly the severe effects that climate change will have on all of us , " dimas said .
" this further underlines both how urgent it is to reach global agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and how important it is for us all to adapt to the climate change that is already under way , " he said . us , china try to dilute damning sections of report however , the report - the un 's most toughly-worded warning on climate change as yet - was the subject of fierce disputes in brussels between scientists and governments . gary yohe , one of the report 's lead authors , told reuters that the mood at the conference in brussels was tense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the us he said china , russia and saudi arabia had raised most objections during the night to a 21-page summary which has to be approved unanimously and will guide policy in coming years on issues such as extending the u.n. 's kyoto protocol beyond 2012 .
the united states was also reported to be among countries seeking to water down sections about damaging impacts from a warming widely blamed on human use of fossil fuels . some scientists objected , for instance , after china tried to eliminate a note saying that there was " very high confidence " that climate change was already affecting " many natural systems , on all continents and in some oceans . "
china , the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the united states and ahead of russia , wanted no mention of the level of confidence . poor countries most at risk the report underlined that poor tropical countries will be hit worst .
worsening water shortages in thirsty countries , malnutrition caused by desiccated fields , property damage from extreme weather events and the spread of disease by mosquitoes and other vectors will amount to a punishing bill that is beyond the ability of vulnerable countries , especially in africa , to pay . " poor people are the most vulnerable and will be the worst hit by the impacts of climate change .
this becomes a global responsibility , " ipcc 's chairman , rajendra pachauri , said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul repeated the warning in brussels as she reminded western countries that they are responsible for most of the world ’ s climate change .
she said they must do more to help poor countries who are the least responsible yet are most affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister , heidemarie wieczorek-zeul “ our production processes , the way we treat the environment and use our energy : these are a direct , ongoing attack on the basic foundations needed to sustain life , " wieczorek-zeul said . the german minister said industrial nations must do everything possible to protect such regions by lowering emissions . the minister suggested that since 20 to 25 percent of global warming can be traced back to the destruction of tropical rainforests , countries who maintain forests should receive financial assistance . " i suggest , that we set up international financial mechanisms to compensate developing countries who maintain their forests because countries who do that , do something for the world climate , and they ought to be rewarded for their efforts . " leading conservation groups on friday urged an immediate global response to the damning un report . " the urgency of this report , presented by the world 's top scientists , should be matched with an equally urgent response by governments , " said hans verolme , director of the world wildlife fund 's global climate change program . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu 's environmental policy flounders as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reclusive billionaire kerkorian is renowed for deal-making the 89-year-old casino mogul , who failed in his 1995 hostile takeover bid of chrysler , indicated his firm would offer an equity partnership to the united auto workers -lrb- uaw -rrb- and senior management of chrysler as a means of gaining their commitment to his long-term solution . but tracinda said the offer hinges on reaching a deal with daimlerchrysler on sharing chrysler 's massive pension and health care liabilities and getting the uaw to agree to a " new satisfactory collective bargaining agreement " in negotiations this fall . " tracinda believes by taking a long-term approach to solving chrysler 's problems , it can become a robust and lasting , stand-alone entity , " the statement added . daimlerchrysler open to " all options " tracinda offered daimlerchrysler a 100-million dollar deposit in exchange for exclusive due diligence rights , which it said it could complete in 60 days . daimlerchrysler spokesman han tjan declined to comment on the tracinda bid but reiterated chairman dieter zetsche 's statements wednesday confirming that the company is in talks with interested third parties and that " all options " are on the table . a representative from the united auto workers was not immediately available for comment . kerkorian , who last made headlines with his failed bid to push general motors corp. into an alliance with renault-nissan , was chrysler 's largest individual shareholder at the time of the 1998 merger with daimler-benz . he later launched a lawsuit trying to recover billions in damages after he said the companies misled investors about the nature of the deal . dream marriage on the rocks nine years down the line , what was originally billed as a " dream marriage " of daimler and chrysler now appears to be on the rocks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler boss dieter zetsche in what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around , daimlerchrysler unveiled in february plans to slash 13,000 more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary and said it would consider " all options . " chief executive dieter zetsche confirmed wednesday that it was in talks over a possible sale of chrysler but revealed few details at the group 's annual meeting in berlin .
a number of shareholders at the meeting called for a rapid sale . analysts estimate chrysler 's value at between five and seven billion dollars , compared with its purchase price of more than $ 35 billion .
despite a series of restructuring plans , chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year as consumers shied away from the fuel-hungry trucks and sports utility vehicles that had dominated its offerings . the company is reportedly considering firm offers from private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund . the head of the canadian auto workers has expressed a preference for magna out of concern that a private group would be less committed to building the business . kerkorian among wealthiest americans tracinda said in a letter to zetsche that " a private ownership approach is in the best interest of all chrysler constituencies . " tracinda representative jerry york said it would take five to seven years to rebuild chrysler by shifting the product mix towards " greener " segments , improving product quality to eliminate a consumer bias towards asian products and speeding up the introduction of new models in order to compete with asian automakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an american flag flies outside a merecedes-benz dealership in michigan tracinda 's attempt to get the union to accept an equity stake as a way to diffuse health care costs could bode well for the other us automakers , said jp morgan analyst himanshu patel . " if the uaw proves supportive of tracinda 's bid , we think it could have positive ramifications for gm and ford , as it may signal the union 's willingness to negotiate solutions to healthcare at the upcoming contract renewal talks , " he wrote in a research report . kerkorian was ranked 26th in a forbes magazine list of the wealthiest americans , with a net worth estimated at nine billion dollars .
his chief holding is mgm mirage , which owns about half of the hotel rooms on the las vegas strip . the son of an armenian immigrant , kerkorian grew up in fresno , california .
after dropping out of school , he boxed for a while under the moniker " rifle right , " before joining the royal air force to fly supply planes from canada to britain during world war ii . after the war , his love of flying and risk-taking drew him to las vegas , where the gambling industry was in its infancy . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .
-lrb- 04.04.2007 -rrb- german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars .
-lrb- 08.03.2007 -rrb- report says gm considering linking with chrysler while some industry experts expect american auto giant general motors to buy daimlerchrysler 's us subsidiary , a german newspaper reported saturday that the companies were discussing an alliance , not a merger .

german police are also investigating claims a third man was involved in last year 's failed suitcase attack . sweden has extradited a 32-year-old islamist , thaer a , to germany on charges that he is the chief fund-raiser of a new terrorist group planning to operate in sudan , german prosecutors said thursday . the jordanian was arrested on march 19 in sweden and flown to germany on wednesday .
a german federal magistrate remanded him in custody the following day . investigators say he is one of five founders of the new group , set up at the bidding of al qaeda leader osama bin laden , and was appointed to organize money transfers . germany arrested another founder of the group , redouane e-h , last july on separate charges of recruiting in europe for an al qaeda-linked group mounting terrorist attacks in iraq . they believe e-h was also an associate of the plotters of the september 11 , 2001 attacks . a 36-year-old man of moroccan origin , who lived in kiel , northern germany until his arrest , e-h is alleged to have transmitted messages to said bahaji , one of the eight alleged 9/11 plotters from hamburg .
bahaji is still at large . the swedes are holding a third alleged founder , a 24-year-old moroccan , but he has appealed against extradition and can not be moved before a verdict is reached . german police were monitoring the men online as they plotted in an internet chat room last june and july , the prosecutor 's office said .
it is a crime in germany to set up a terrorist group , even if it does not attack germany . the five aimed to open a new ' front ' in sudan to wage jihad or holy war against " crusaders , " an islamist term for what are perceived as threatening western nations . e-h , who has contacts in syria , algeria and iraq , was the communications officer of the group , prosecutors said . train bomb plot linked to initiation test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suitcase bombers may have had an accomplice meanwhile fresh details emerged about an islamist attempt last year to blow up two german trains , with a claim that there may have been a third plotter with al qaeda links . previously it was thought the july 31 plot , which failed when the bombs did not explode , was a " freelance " attack by two lebanese students who were arrested soon after . the news magazine der spiegel said it would publish a report that showed the two students took on the mission as an initiation test for khaled ibrahim al-hajdib , the sweden-based brother of one of the accused . one of the men , jihad hamad , goes on trial in beirut next week .
the other , youssef al-hajdib , is in custody in germany and likely to be indicted this summer . spiegel said youssef al-hajdib used the term " initiation test " in an e-mail .
both students had hoped to go to iraq to fight . the magazine added that swedish investigators believe ibrahim was recruiting fighters for iraq and fund-raising .
german prosecutors believed he might have known of the plot or have even commissioned it . it said he had been arrested in lebanon , where " ' ources " linked him to al-qaeda .

but the us , china and russia stand accused of seeking to water down some sections . eu leaders agreed tough targets last month for reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming , with the aim of limiting the rise in temperature to below two degrees celsius , compared to pre-industrial levels . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top expert authority on global warming , said in its report friday that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report was published after all-night negotiations in brussels " the report shows many of the serious impacts that would occur if global warming exceeded the eu 's target of not more than two degrees celsius above the pre-industrial level , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said . " the temperature today is already almost 0.8 degrees celcius above that level , so the world needs to act fast if we are to succeed in stabilizing climate change and thereby prevent its worst impacts , " he said in a statement . global warming to hit europe unevenly the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . global warming will hit europe hard but unevenly this century , cursing the south but giving a mixed blessing to the north , the report said .
mediterranean countries can brace for a higher risk of severe droughts , reduced harvests and deadly heat waves , while high-latitude nations will face flooding and severe weather balanced by longer growing seasons and expanded areas for agriculture and forestry . " today 's ipcc report spells out very clearly the severe effects that climate change will have on all of us , " dimas said .
" this further underlines both how urgent it is to reach global agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and how important it is for us all to adapt to the climate change that is already under way , " he said . us , china try to dilute damning sections of report however , the report - the un 's most toughly-worded warning on climate change as yet - was the subject of fierce disputes in brussels between scientists and governments . gary yohe , one of the report 's lead authors , told reuters that the mood at the conference in brussels was tense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the us he said china , russia and saudi arabia had raised most objections during the night to a 21-page summary which has to be approved unanimously and will guide policy in coming years on issues such as extending the u.n.

the united states was also reported to be among countries seeking to water down sections about damaging impacts from a warming widely blamed on human use of fossil fuels . some scientists objected , for instance , after china tried to eliminate a note saying that there was " very high confidence " that climate change was already affecting " many natural systems , on all continents and in some oceans . "
china , the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the united states and ahead of russia , wanted no mention of the level of confidence . poor countries most at risk the report underlined that poor tropical countries will be hit worst .
worsening water shortages in thirsty countries , malnutrition caused by desiccated fields , property damage from extreme weather events and the spread of disease by mosquitoes and other vectors will amount to a punishing bill that is beyond the ability of vulnerable countries , especially in africa , to pay . " poor people are the most vulnerable and will be the worst hit by the impacts of climate change .
this becomes a global responsibility , " ipcc 's chairman , rajendra pachauri , said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul repeated the warning in brussels as she reminded western countries that they are responsible for most of the world ’ s climate change .

" the report confirms that climate change is a fact , ' merkel told the saturday edition of the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . " for that reason we need rapid and decisive action to limit the global rise in temperatures and to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions , " the chancellor said . german environment minister sigmar gabriel demanded putting in place an ambitious program on climate protection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has ambitious emission-reduction goals , but can it meet them ?
" this year we have to set course for a multilateral climate protection regime for the period after 2012 , in order to prevent global warming of more than two degrees celsius compared with pre-industrial values , " gabriel said in berlin .
the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . the european union , under the current german presidency , set a goal of cutting co2 emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 at a summit in brussels march 8-9 .
this would be increased to 30 percent , if other major countries followed suit , the member states agreed . germany is hosting the g8 summit in june , where the major industrialized states are expected to put climate change and energy at the top of the agenda . " i will address the theme at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , " merkel told newspaper .
" my aim is to have all nations take on the responsibility for protecting the climate . " variety of voices michael müller , an official in the german environment ministry , described the difficult negotiations leading up to the report as " a mixture of top-level diplomacy and kindergarten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are concerned about the increase in emissions that 's accompanying china 's rapid economic growth the united states , china , saudi arabia and russia had wanted to downgrade human influence on climate change after realizing that climate change " can no longer be denied , " he said . the german environmental organization bund demanded " immediate action to cut greenhouse gas emissions , " urging rich countries to act to limit the effects on poor regions of the world . a spokesman for the german food aid organization welthungerhilfe said the basic human rights of access to food and water would be affected , as the number of people suffering severe water shortage could triple to three billion . power plant plans germany 's green party demanded a halt to plans in germany to build new coal-fired power stations . " in germany we have to address electricity production in particular , as it produces more than 40 per cent of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , ' greens member of parliament bärbel höhn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants are cleaner , but controversial because of safety concerns electricity producers were talking about bringing 40 new coal-fired power plants on line , she said .
if this was implemented , electricity generation would produce 170 million tons of co2 a year , against a total target for germany of 200 million tons , she added . she also questioned the viability of plans to extract co2 from exhaust gases and to store it indefinitely . speaking ahead of the report 's publication , german development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said : " industrialized countries have a responsibility .
they must cut emissions radically . " she called simultaneously for more aid to developing countries , which would suffer the worst effects of climate change .
protecting tropical rainforests should have " absolute priority , " the minister said , adding that up to a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions resulted from the clearing of the rainforests . " i 'm pushing for international financing mechanisms to compensate developing countries for stopping deforestation , " wieczorek-zeul said . international action needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer the former head of the un environment program -lrb- nep -rrb- , klaus töpfer , said a commitment to " drastic international action " was needed .
this was especially the case as the poorest people - primarily in africa - would experience the worst effects .
he was critical of the wrangling over detail in the negotiations leading up to the report 's publication . " one should no longer be fighting over the intensity and probability of climate change , " he said .
" climate change has occurred , it is speeding up , and it is caused by people . " there was a broad movement among ordinary people and business in the united states towards greater climate protection , töpfer said . the chinese leadership had also realized the country needed to emit less co2 . " even in the oil-producing arab countries , there will be rising interest in energy not based on oil , " he predicted . töpfer said the un security council would discuss the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.04.2007 daimlerchrysler : " a failed experiment " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel daimler should reach for the skies without chrysler weighing it down professor ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , told dw-world.de that daimlerchrysler has a bright future without the loss making chrysler business . the german-us auto giant officially confirmed on april 4 that it is in talks to sell chrysler amid growing pressure from shareholders .
it has been nine years since the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a 27-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler .
last year chrysler posted an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- . former ceo jürgen schrepp called the merger of mercedes-benz and chrysler " a marriage made in heaven " in 1998 , but was it ever a good idea ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research today we can see that it was a failed experiment .
they never managed to use common parts and components .
over the last nine years they have really been separate companies which functioned under one holding entity .
it 's really no surprise that daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler because the division has serious economic problems and it has no links to the other parts of the company . could it have been possible for the two companies to share more of their manufacturing ? the question is : could you use the same platforms and components for a premium car as for a car manufactured at higher volumes ?
we know that it 's possible in the industry .
look at toyota for example - they have the premium lexus brand and the mass-market toyota cars .
these two brands share 80 to 90 percent of their components .
even porsche and vw use common components .
the porsche cayenne is in principle the same car as the vw touareg -lrb- suv -rrb- . so it is possible to have commonalities between premium and high-volume cars , but daimlerchrysler just did n't do this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche why not ? the philosophy and the management styles of the swabians and the americans are rather different .
the mercedes-benz people are very proud and do n't communicate much with the americans and the same applies to chrysler .
chrysler felt that if they used mercedes parts their cars would be too expensive and mercedes said that if they used chrysler parts the quality and the exclusivity of mercedes cars would be lost .
therefore they did n't cooperate . how much of a problem is it for chrysler that they do n't make small , economical cars that are cheaper ? at the moment it is a big problem , because chrysler has only concentrated on the us - 90 percent of their cars are sold on the us market .
chrysler is in line with general motors and ford .
all three companies have big problems due to the fact that they are offering a lot of gas-guzzlers in the us , like suvs and pick-ups .
what we have seen is that consumers have changed their minds and are opting for more fuel-efficient cars and that is a problem for chrysler , as well as ford and general motors , that they have to solve .
that will take time . do you think daimlerchrysler will sell chrysler ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of " gas guzzling " chryslers - less appealing to the us public these days yes , i think they are preparing to sell .
they have been in conversation with various investment companies and i think in three to six months it will be sold to one of these groups . if chrysler is so unsuccessful , why would anyone want to buy the company ? at the moment we have n't seen a carmaker interested in buying chrysler - the company in its present form would be difficult to continue successfully .
it produces less than three million cars per year and so it does n't have strong economies of scale in its production .
so it 's more a question of looking at who could use parts of the chrysler company .
financial investors go into companies , break up them up and sell the successful parts .
for example the supplier business - the component productions and the press shop and these parts could be sold and purchased by other suppliers .
brands could also be sold - jeep is a very successful brand , others like dodge and chrysler itself are weaker .
they may be sold , for example to chinese carmakers who are strong and looking to capture the american market . ceo dieter zetsche was a hero at daimlerchrysler for a while because of the success of his restructuring program in detroit , although some of the gains he made have not lasted .
do you think will stay on as ceo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes production in bremen - still very profitable i am very sure that he will continue as ceo of daimlerchrysler .
we can see now that zetsche has n't taken one false step in his two years as daimlerchrysler ceo .
he started to fix the quality at mercedes and now they are coming out with new products , such as the e-class .
currently the c-class has been very successful in some markets , like germany .
zetsche is the guy who started thinking about the future of chrysler and the future of mercedes and he started the process of talking to other parties about selling chrysler .
so he has done everything necessary to bring the group back to profit , so from my point of view there is no reason to change management . shareholders have been very unhappy about the company 's performance .
will they be more optimistic now that a sale of chrysler is likely ? i think they can be very optimistic for the future because we think chrsyler will be sold in a few months .
then they will be left with a group which consists of mercedes trucks , which is very strong ; it 's actually the global market leader .
then we have mercedes cars which is becoming stronger and stronger .
by 2009 or 2010 the new e-class will be released and that will be very important for their profitability .
they also have a strong financial services arm which is very successful .
because of these three successful parts we will see stock prices continue to increase , as will the group 's profitability . emma wynne interviewed ferdinand dudenhöffer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future .

bremen drew 0-0 against az alkmaar in holland . bayer leverkusen effectively shot themselves in the foot as far as progressing to the uefa cup semi-finals thursday by losing 3-0 at home to spanish side osasuna . the germans ’ quarter-final opponents struck in the opening minute and twice more in a 90 second spell in the second-half for an emphatic triumph which puts the 1988 champions in danger of crashing out unless they can stage a remarkable fight-back in spain next week . javier cueller gave the spaniards a dream start when he headed home a corner kick 55 seconds into the first leg game in germany .
david lopez doubled the lead in the 71st after his first attempt was saved by goalkeeper rene adler . leverkusen 's biggest home defeat in europe was sealed less than two minutes later with a lobbed own goal by pierre webo , who had come on as a substitute just seconds earlier . leverkusen controlled possession but were unable to crack the firm osasuna defense which has allowed just one goal in six uefa cup games . “ things do n't look good for us now .
we did n't play up to our potential while they were good on the counter and deserved to win , ” said leverkusen 's germany midfielder bernd schneider . lopez and enrique coralles will miss the return leg at home after being booked for time-wasting , but the match next thursday appears a mere formality for osasuna , who are one of three spanish clubs in the final eight . werder still in with a shot werder bremen , the other german side still in the uefa cup , faced their second dutch side in as many rounds as they traveled to az alkmaar . bremen fought to a difficult 0-0 draw which extended the dutch side 's unbeaten run at home to 30 games since they entered european competition in 1977 . coached by former barcelona and holland manager louis van gaal , alkmaar went into the match as the competition 's top scorers this season but a resolute bremen defense kept the free-scoring dutch at bay – and nearly grabbed themselves a valuable away goal in the process . clemens fritz had the germans ’ best chance when he sprinted onto a defense-splitting back-heel from playmaker diego but his shot was well saved . alkmaar started slowly and their first chance came on the half-hour when winger julian jenner crossed for maarten martens but his header was turned over the bar by bremen goalkeeper tim wiese . the second-half was much livelier with werder ’ s left back pierre wome and diego both denied by great saves by az goalie boy waterman . tim wiese was also busy at the other end ; the best save of the half coming when he smothered a close range attempt from belgian striker moussa dembele . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german teams make two-sided attack on uefa cup both bremen and leverkusen grabbed wins in the second leg of their uefa cup matches to advance to the quarterfinals .

german police are also investigating claims a third man was involved in last year 's failed suitcase attack . sweden has extradited a 32-year-old islamist , thaer a , to germany on charges that he is the chief fund-raiser of a new terrorist group planning to operate in sudan , german prosecutors said thursday . the jordanian was arrested on march 19 in sweden and flown to germany on wednesday .
a german federal magistrate remanded him in custody the following day . investigators say he is one of five founders of the new group , set up at the bidding of al qaeda leader osama bin laden , and was appointed to organize money transfers . germany arrested another founder of the group , redouane e-h , last july on separate charges of recruiting in europe for an al qaeda-linked group mounting terrorist attacks in iraq . they believe e-h was also an associate of the plotters of the september 11 , 2001 attacks . a 36-year-old man of moroccan origin , who lived in kiel , northern germany until his arrest , e-h is alleged to have transmitted messages to said bahaji , one of the eight alleged 9/11 plotters from hamburg .
bahaji is still at large . the swedes are holding a third alleged founder , a 24-year-old moroccan , but he has appealed against extradition and can not be moved before a verdict is reached . german police were monitoring the men online as they plotted in an internet chat room last june and july , the prosecutor 's office said .
it is a crime in germany to set up a terrorist group , even if it does not attack germany . the five aimed to open a new ' front ' in sudan to wage jihad or holy war against " crusaders , " an islamist term for what are perceived as threatening western nations . e-h , who has contacts in syria , algeria and iraq , was the communications officer of the group , prosecutors said . train bomb plot linked to initiation test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suitcase bombers may have had an accomplice meanwhile fresh details emerged about an islamist attempt last year to blow up two german trains , with a claim that there may have been a third plotter with al qaeda links . previously it was thought the july 31 plot , which failed when the bombs did not explode , was a " freelance " attack by two lebanese students who were arrested soon after . the news magazine der spiegel said it would publish a report that showed the two students took on the mission as an initiation test for khaled ibrahim al-hajdib , the sweden-based brother of one of the accused . one of the men , jihad hamad , goes on trial in beirut next week .
the other , youssef al-hajdib , is in custody in germany and likely to be indicted this summer . spiegel said youssef al-hajdib used the term " initiation test " in an e-mail .
both students had hoped to go to iraq to fight . the magazine added that swedish investigators believe ibrahim was recruiting fighters for iraq and fund-raising .
german prosecutors believed he might have known of the plot or have even commissioned it . it said he had been arrested in lebanon , where " ' ources " linked him to al-qaeda .

but the us , china and russia stand accused of seeking to water down some sections . eu leaders agreed tough targets last month for reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming , with the aim of limiting the rise in temperature to below two degrees celsius , compared to pre-industrial levels . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top expert authority on global warming , said in its report friday that up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 c -lrb- 2.7 f to 4.5 f -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report was published after all-night negotiations in brussels " the report shows many of the serious impacts that would occur if global warming exceeded the eu 's target of not more than two degrees celsius above the pre-industrial level , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said . " the temperature today is already almost 0.8 degrees celcius above that level , so the world needs to act fast if we are to succeed in stabilizing climate change and thereby prevent its worst impacts , " he said in a statement . global warming to hit europe unevenly the report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall patterns , intensify tropical storms , accelerate the melting of arctic ice and mountain glaciers , and amplify the risk of drought , flooding and water stress . global warming will hit europe hard but unevenly this century , cursing the south but giving a mixed blessing to the north , the report said .
mediterranean countries can brace for a higher risk of severe droughts , reduced harvests and deadly heat waves , while high-latitude nations will face flooding and severe weather balanced by longer growing seasons and expanded areas for agriculture and forestry . " today 's ipcc report spells out very clearly the severe effects that climate change will have on all of us , " dimas said .
" this further underlines both how urgent it is to reach global agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and how important it is for us all to adapt to the climate change that is already under way , " he said . us , china try to dilute damning sections of report however , the report - the un 's most toughly-worded warning on climate change as yet - was the subject of fierce disputes in brussels between scientists and governments . gary yohe , one of the report 's lead authors , told reuters that the mood at the conference in brussels was tense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the us he said china , russia and saudi arabia had raised most objections during the night to a 21-page summary which has to be approved unanimously and will guide policy in coming years on issues such as extending the u.n. 's kyoto protocol beyond 2012 .
the united states was also reported to be among countries seeking to water down sections about damaging impacts from a warming widely blamed on human use of fossil fuels . some scientists objected , for instance , after china tried to eliminate a note saying that there was " very high confidence " that climate change was already affecting " many natural systems , on all continents and in some oceans . "
china , the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the united states and ahead of russia , wanted no mention of the level of confidence . poor countries most at risk the report underlined that poor tropical countries will be hit worst .
worsening water shortages in thirsty countries , malnutrition caused by desiccated fields , property damage from extreme weather events and the spread of disease by mosquitoes and other vectors will amount to a punishing bill that is beyond the ability of vulnerable countries , especially in africa , to pay . " poor people are the most vulnerable and will be the worst hit by the impacts of climate change .
this becomes a global responsibility , " ipcc 's chairman , rajendra pachauri , said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul repeated the warning in brussels as she reminded western countries that they are responsible for most of the world ’ s climate change .
she said they must do more to help poor countries who are the least responsible yet are most affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister , heidemarie wieczorek-zeul “ our production processes , the way we treat the environment and use our energy : these are a direct , ongoing attack on the basic foundations needed to sustain life , " wieczorek-zeul said . the german minister said industrial nations must do everything possible to protect such regions by lowering emissions . the minister suggested that since 20 to 25 percent of global warming can be traced back to the destruction of tropical rainforests , countries who maintain forests should receive financial assistance . " i suggest , that we set up international financial mechanisms to compensate developing countries who maintain their forests because countries who do that , do something for the world climate , and they ought to be rewarded for their efforts . " leading conservation groups on friday urged an immediate global response to the damning un report . " the urgency of this report , presented by the world 's top scientists , should be matched with an equally urgent response by governments , " said hans verolme , director of the world wildlife fund 's global climate change program . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu 's environmental policy flounders as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .

manchester united said the police 's response was a " serious over-reaction " and accused the police of handing out " indiscriminate beatings " .
but achille serra said : " to criticise the police is a sport .
the british like to do it .
" the police were forced to intervene between two sets of violent fans . "
he added : " the stewards were literally swept aside and at that point the police were obliged to intervene .
" if people are criticising the security forces ...
i was at the stadium and i saw no negative behaviour .
certainly when you are facing facts of this nature you can not hand out flowers , that much is clear . "
a home office minister has said answers are needed from italian police following the clashes .
vernon coaker 's remarks came after baton-wielding police fought with supporters at rome 's stadio olimpico during manchester united 's 2-1 defeat .
the british embassy said 11 manchester united fans were taken to hospital , with two reportedly kept in overnight .

the two sets of supporters were separated in one section of the ground by a barrier with riot police gathered on the manchester united side .
after each goal both sets of fans surged towards the barrier .
at one stage , riot police with shields and batons were seen repeatedly striking manchester united supporters .
manchester united said in a statement : " the disturbing scenes witnessed in the stadio olimpico last night shocked everyone at old trafford .
" in what the club views as a serious over-reaction , local police handed out indiscriminate beatings to united supporters .

the city 's mayor walter veltroni criticised manchester united officials and said the advice could create a " negative climate " .

manchester united said the police 's response was a " serious over-reaction " and accused the police of handing out " indiscriminate beatings " .
but achille serra said : " to criticise the police is a sport .
the british like to do it .
" the police were forced to intervene between two sets of violent fans . "
he added : " the stewards were literally swept aside and at that point the police were obliged to intervene .
" if people are criticising the security forces ...
i was at the stadium and i saw no negative behaviour .
certainly when you are facing facts of this nature you can not hand out flowers , that much is clear . "
a home office minister has said answers are needed from italian police following the clashes .
vernon coaker 's remarks came after baton-wielding police fought with supporters at rome 's stadio olimpico during manchester united 's 2-1 defeat .
the british embassy said 11 manchester united fans were taken to hospital , with two reportedly kept in overnight .
mr coaker said : " the scenes that we saw on our television screens were extremely concerning . "

during the game both sets of fans could be seen throwing missiles at each other .
the two sets of supporters were separated in one section of the ground by a barrier with riot police gathered on the manchester united side .
after each goal both sets of fans surged towards the barrier .
at one stage , riot police with shields and batons were seen repeatedly striking manchester united supporters .
manchester united said in a statement : " the disturbing scenes witnessed in the stadio olimpico last night shocked everyone at old trafford .
" in what the club views as a serious over-reaction , local police handed out indiscriminate beatings to united supporters .
" in those circumstances , neither manchester united , nor as roma is able to call the police to account . "

several delegations at a meeting of the un climate panel in brussels have asked for the final version to reflect less certainty than the draft .
the report is expected to say climate change is already having major impacts on the natural world .
the panel believes there is also a discernible impact on human societies .
but as delegates talked past dawn , some of the detail was reported to have been taken out of the final wording .
correspondents say the us , saudi arabia , china and india were unhappy with the strength of the language in the draft summary , due to be released by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- . "
adaptation alone is not expected to cope with all the projected effects of climate change " ipcc draft " the europeans want to send a strong signal .
the us does not want as much quantification , " one official told the french news agency afp .
water shortages draft versions seen by bbc news warn it will be hard for societies to adapt to all the likely climate impacts .
the report is set to say that a temperature rise above 1.5c from 1990 levels would put about one-third of species at risk of extinction .
more than one billion people would be at greater risk of water shortages , primarily because of the melting of mountain glaciers and ice fields which act as natural reservoirs .
the scientific work reviewed by ipcc scientists includes more than 29,000 pieces of data on observed changes in physical and biological aspects of the natural world .
eighty-five percent of these , it believes , are consistent with a warming world .
growing certainty since the ipcc 's last global assessment in 2001 , the amount of scientific work on observing and collating changes to the natural world has vastly increased .
in parallel , computer models which project the earth 's climatic future have grown ever more sophisticated , though there are still uncertainties in their forecasts and they remain unable to model some physical processes accurately .
the combination of more observational evidence and better models allows scientists to paint a much more detailed picture of what is happening in different regions of the world , and what they believe is likely to happen in the future .
" what we find is that evidence of the impacts of climate change is much sharper , much more reliable , " said ipcc chair rajendra pachauri .
" many of the uncertainties have been resolved ; and they confirm that the poorest of the poor are most likely to be hit by the impacts of climate change . "
fresh water is perhaps the most serious issue for human societies .
the world 's great mountain ranges , such as the himalayas , rockies , andes and alps , act as natural reservoirs , trapping winter rain and snowfall as ice , and releasing it gradually in the summer .
evidence suggests that glaciers are shrinking in all of these ranges .
one recent study predicted that 75 % of alpine glaciers would have vanished by the end of this century .
as the ice disappears , spring and autumn floods become more likely , with an increased risk of drought in summer .
the ipcc is expected to say there is " very high confidence " that these trends are already occurring .
it will also project a higher risk of flooding for many major cities on or near the coast .
carbon cuts some observers of climate issues have long maintained that action on climate change should focus on protecting societies and natural systems against impacts such as floods and drought , rather than on curbing greenhouse gas emissions .
the ipcc , however , is set to conclude that " adaptation alone is not expected to cope with all the projected effects of climate change , and especially not over the long run as most impacts increase in magnitude " .
poorer societies are likely to be hardest hit , as they lack the resources to set up protective measures and change their economic base .
adapting to climate impacts , in the ipcc 's view , should go hand in hand with reducing emissions .
this is the second in a series of ipcc reports coming out this year , together making up its fourth global climate assessment .
the first element , on the science of climate change , was released in february , concluding it is at least 90 % likely that human activities are principally responsible for the warming observed since 1950 .
the third part , which comes out in may , will focus on ways of curbing the rise in greenhouse gas concentrations and temperature .

several delegations at a meeting of the un climate panel in brussels have asked for the final version to reflect less certainty than the draft .
the report is expected to say climate change is already having major impacts on the natural world .
the panel believes there is also a discernible impact on human societies .
but as delegates talked past dawn , some of the detail was reported to have been taken out of the final wording .
correspondents say the us , saudi arabia , china and india were unhappy with the strength of the language in the draft summary , due to be released by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
adaptation alone is not expected to cope with all the projected effects of climate change ipcc draft " the europeans want to send a strong signal .
the us does not want as much quantification , " one official told the french news agency afp .
water shortages draft versions seen by bbc news warn it will be hard for societies to adapt to all the likely climate impacts .
the report is set to say that a temperature rise above 1.5c from 1990 levels would put about one-third of species at risk of extinction .
more than one billion people would be at greater risk of water shortages , primarily because of the melting of mountain glaciers and ice fields which act as natural reservoirs .
the scientific work reviewed by ipcc scientists includes more than 29,000 pieces of data on observed changes in physical and biological aspects of the natural world .
eighty-five percent of these , it believes , are consistent with a warming world .
growing certainty since the ipcc 's last global assessment in 2001 , the amount of scientific work on observing and collating changes to the natural world has vastly increased .
in parallel , computer models which project the earth 's climatic future have grown ever more sophisticated , though there are still uncertainties in their forecasts and they remain unable to model some physical processes accurately .
the combination of more observational evidence and better models allows scientists to paint a much more detailed picture of what is happening in different regions of the world , and what they believe is likely to happen in the future .
" what we find is that evidence of the impacts of climate change is much sharper , much more reliable , " said ipcc chair rajendra pachauri .
countries supplied by glacier melt could face more droughts " many of the uncertainties have been resolved ; and they confirm that the poorest of the poor are most likely to be hit by the impacts of climate change . "
fresh water is perhaps the most serious issue for human societies .
the world 's great mountain ranges , such as the himalayas , rockies , andes and alps , act as natural reservoirs , trapping winter rain and snowfall as ice , and releasing it gradually in the summer .
evidence suggests that glaciers are shrinking in all of these ranges .
one recent study predicted that 75 % of alpine glaciers would have vanished by the end of this century .
as the ice disappears , spring and autumn floods become more likely , with an increased risk of drought in summer .
the ipcc is expected to say there is " very high confidence " that these trends are already occurring .
it will also project a higher risk of flooding for many major cities on or near the coast .
carbon cuts some observers of climate issues have long maintained that action on climate change should focus on protecting societies and natural systems against impacts such as floods and drought , rather than on curbing greenhouse gas emissions .
dealing with drought enlarge image the ipcc , however , is set to conclude that " adaptation alone is not expected to cope with all the projected effects of climate change , and especially not over the long run as most impacts increase in magnitude " .
poorer societies are likely to be hardest hit , as they lack the resources to set up protective measures and change their economic base .
adapting to climate impacts , in the ipcc 's view , should go hand in hand with reducing emissions .
this is the second in a series of ipcc reports coming out this year , together making up its fourth global climate assessment .
the first element , on the science of climate change , was released in february , concluding it is at least 90 % likely that human activities are principally responsible for the warming observed since 1950 .
the third part , which comes out in may , will focus on ways of curbing the rise in greenhouse gas concentrations and temperature .

more than 49 million voters will be exercising their franchise at nearly 50,000 polling stations , watched over by thousands of police and paramilitary troops .
because of its sheer size and numbers , uttar pradesh , commonly called up , holds an important place in the indian political system .

according to the published masterplan , developing the maze would cost up to £ 400m , and unless a private sector development partner with deep pockets shares the cost , the project is dead .
however , there seems to be no shortage of takers .
eight or nine bid consortia responded with initial expressions of interest and these have now been whittled down to a shortlist of four .
then it is up to the executive and value for money .
undoubtedly , it will feature large in discussions between the northern ireland parties and the chancellor .
david hanson had already promised a decision on the stadium before any planning application could be submitted in november .
with the remarkable speed of change at stormont in the past fortnight the feeling is that devolution could bring that decision forward - maybe even before the summer recess .
within a fortnight representatives of the three sports which would use the stadium , football , rugby and gaelic games , will be asked to sign off on an updated business plan .
this business plan will then form the basis of individual presentations to the decision-making bodies within the three sports , who will also be given first sight of the concept design of the stadium by designers hok .
these presentations will probably be completed by early next month .
the sports will then be asked to complete their internal decision-making processes and declare their intention to commit fully to the project and not just in principle as at present .
of course , none of that will wash with those fans who believe that the stadium should be built in belfast and that one at the maze will be a white elephant impossible to get to or away from , and which will be a never-ending drain on the public purse .
they argue that the maze was chosen because it suited the political ends of an unpopular direct rule administration - and had nothing to do with the needs of sport or those who follow it .
now that it looks like a stormont executive will make the ultimate decision they must refocus their fire .
the dup , too , must consider the consequences of potentially alienating some supporters .
but they will be well aware that when the so-called " bread and butter " issues were raised on the doorsteps in march it was water charges and rates , not the maze , that people wanted action on .

how the maze site could look if the plans get the go ahead although remaining publicly very supportive , the minister responsible , david hanson , will wash his hands of it if stormont returns on 8 may .
then it is over to the department of culture arts and leisure , which will be responsible for sport ; finance - which controls the purse strings ; environment - which controls planning , and ultimately the office of the first and deputy first minister .
and what do all these have in common ?
dup ministers at the helm .
it is an issue which holds potential pitfalls for the party .
it is much easier for sinn fein - whose price for supporting a stadium at the old prison site is retention of one of the h-blocks and the prison hospital -lrb- where the hunger strikers died -rrb- as an international centre for conflict transformation .
the dup have had to swallow that , even though to many of their supporters it will always be known as a " shrine to terrorism " .
then there is the opposition to the maze location by a sizeable section of the northern ireland football team 's support - many of them probably dup supporters as well .
' endorsement of main parties ' officially , the party has no stated policy on the maze .
it did not even rate a mention in its manifesto for the assembly election .
neither has ian paisley ever publicly stated his own views on the project .
but , according to stormont sources , he has told david hanson that the lagan valley mla edwin poots officially speaks for him on the maze / long kesh regeneration panel which he chairs .
" the government would not have taken this so far but for the endorsement of the four main parties , " said one source .
according to the published masterplan , developing the maze would cost up to £ 400m , and unless a private sector development partner with deep pockets shares the cost , the project is dead edwin poots has been a very strong advocate of a stadium at the maze - hardly surprising as it is slap bang in the middle of his constituency .
in recent days , he has been mentioned as a possible dcal minister .
the dup is not saying .
but if he was given the job , it would , rightly or wrongly , be taken as a strong signal of its intentions on the maze .
either way it is probably now down to money - not personalities .
according to the published masterplan , developing the maze would cost up to £ 400m , and unless a private sector development partner with deep pockets shares the cost , the project is dead .
however , there seems to be no shortage of takers .
eight or nine bid consortia responded with initial expressions of interest and these have now been whittled down to a shortlist of four .
one of the infamous h-blocks is to be retained then it is up to the executive and value for money .
undoubtedly , it will feature large in discussions between the northern ireland parties and the chancellor .
david hanson had already promised a decision on the stadium before any planning application could be submitted in november .
with the remarkable speed of change at stormont in the past fortnight the feeling is that devolution could bring that decision forward - maybe even before the summer recess .
within a fortnight representatives of the three sports which would use the stadium , football , rugby and gaelic games , will be asked to sign off on an updated business plan .
this business plan will then form the basis of individual presentations to the decision-making bodies within the three sports , who will also be given first sight of the concept design of the stadium by designers hok .
these presentations will probably be completed by early next month .
the sports will then be asked to complete their internal decision-making processes and declare their intention to commit fully to the project and not just in principle as at present .
of course , none of that will wash with those fans who believe that the stadium should be built in belfast and that one at the maze will be a white elephant impossible to get to or away from , and which will be a never-ending drain on the public purse .
plan includes a new £ 55m multi-sports stadium they argue that the maze was chosen because it suited the political ends of an unpopular direct rule administration - and had nothing to do with the needs of sport or those who follow it .
now that it looks like a stormont executive will make the ultimate decision they must refocus their fire .
the dup , too , must consider the consequences of potentially alienating some supporters .
but they will be well aware that when the so-called " bread and butter " issues were raised on the doorsteps in march it was water charges and rates , not the maze , that people wanted action on .

one of the infamous h-blocks is to be retained then it is up to the executive and value for money .
undoubtedly , it will feature large in discussions between the northern ireland parties and the chancellor .
david hanson had already promised a decision on the stadium before any planning application could be submitted in november .
with the remarkable speed of change at stormont in the past fortnight the feeling is that devolution could bring that decision forward - maybe even before the summer recess .
within a fortnight representatives of the three sports which would use the stadium , football , rugby and gaelic games , will be asked to sign off on an updated business plan .
this business plan will then form the basis of individual presentations to the decision-making bodies within the three sports , who will also be given first sight of the concept design of the stadium by designers hok .
these presentations will probably be completed by early next month .
the sports will then be asked to complete their internal decision-making processes and declare their intention to commit fully to the project and not just in principle as at present .
of course , none of that will wash with those fans who believe that the stadium should be built in belfast and that one at the maze will be a white elephant impossible to get to or away from , and which will be a never-ending drain on the public purse .
plan includes a new £ 55m multi-sports stadium they argue that the maze was chosen because it suited the political ends of an unpopular direct rule administration - and had nothing to do with the needs of sport or those who follow it .
now that it looks like a stormont executive will make the ultimate decision they must refocus their fire .
the dup , too , must consider the consequences of potentially alienating some supporters .
but they will be well aware that when the so-called " bread and butter " issues were raised on the doorsteps in march it was water charges and rates , not the maze , that people wanted action on .
as for white elephants , the past few weeks have shown us that pigs can fly .

women in games at the university of wales , newport later this month wants to encourage more girls to consider a career in developing games .
producer and researcher emma westecott said although women outnumbered men in playing games online , only 18 % of game developers were women .
she said : " a lot of people 's perception is that it is for boys . "
ms westecott has worked in the games industry for more than a decade and achieved recognition for her work on adventure game starship titanic .
now a games research fellow at at the university of wales , newport , which hosts the conference , she has mainly worked alongside men .
" games companies spend a lot of time trying to attract women " she said .
" it 's quite hard because there are n't that many women applying for jobs . "
' portrayed realistically ' she said that in the early days of the industry , before the 1980s , more women were proportionately working in it .
but this appeared to have changed after game-creating grew .
meanwhile , 54 % of those playing games online are female .
ms westecott said big companies were keen to attract women to game playing , although their first " silly " marketing tool was turning consoles pink .
she said : " there certainly is an argument that historically games were made by boys for boys .
but i think with the third generations of consoles we are seeing come through , things are really starting to change . "
" it 's easy to forget -lrb- lara croft -rrb- is also an action hero and in some ways , a role model . "
emma westecott " the nintendo wii , for example , is very much marketed at the family and orientated around people playing together . "
different women like different games , said ms westecott , but she added : " you tend to find more women playing network games like world of warcraft . "
women had not always been portrayed realistically in games , said ms westecott .
she recalls spending all day as a young teenager playing pong on her atari st with her mum .
she said : " there is the often quoted example of lara croft and her ever-expanding chest , as she starred in more computer games . "
but there is also a positive aspect to the lara croft character .
" it 's easy to forget she 's also an action hero and in some ways a role model .
i think that some games present women as helpless and needing to be rescued .
i probably find those more offensive . "
ms westecott said the conference would give a voice to women in the games industry and allow them to share the latest research into games .
