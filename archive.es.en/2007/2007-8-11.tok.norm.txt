the prime minister himself later confirmed that his governing party could no longer govern either with his junior partners , nor without them .
" i see no possibility of supporting a minority government , and we do n't want to have the kind of government we have had recently , " he said at a press conference .
he hinted at the dismissal of two cabinet members , but gave no details .
the eu 's biggest former communist country has been in political turmoil for months and speculation has been rife that kaczynski would end up calling for elections to be held two years early .
speaking after earlier talks with kaczynski , the head of the radical league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , roman giertych , had told journalists on saturday that " the prime minister told me that he was breaking the coalition with the lpr and that lpr ministers would be dismissed on monday . "
the ministers of the populist sambroona party , which has already announced it is quitting the government , would also be fired , giertych added .
" mounting chaos " bitter infighting has sparked a political crisis within the coalition headed by kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
the prime minister 's twin brother , president lech kaczynski , and opposition leader donald tusk agreed on thursday that it was " inevitable " that elections scheduled for 2009 would have to be brought forward , most probably to october .
it was time to end the " mounting chaos , " tusk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrzej lepper the pis leadership meeting saturday was expected to make a decision on calling early polls , which kaczynski has more than once brandished as a threat to bring his coalition partners into line .
the two junior parties are uncertain of receiving more than five percent of the vote - the hurdle required for seats in parliament - and are therefore wary of an early ballot .
but such a move would also spell problems for the pis , which according to opinion polls only has some 23 percent support , compared with 33 percent for tusk 's civic platform .
adam lipinski , the deputy pis leader , said friday that he did not envisage a future coalition with tusk 's party , which was narrowly defeated in the 2005 elections .
corruption allegations the existing coalition first fell apart last september when kaczynski fired andrzej lepper , the deputy premier and leader of samoobrona , amid a budget and defence policy dispute .
he was forced to take lepper back three weeks later to stave off early elections , in the face of poor poll ratings .
the latest crisis erupted in early july , when the premier again sacked lepper over corruption allegations , and samoobrona said it was leaving the coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski and andrzej lepper in happier days lepper denies the charges against him , and has threatened to level unspecified allegations of wrongdoing against the prime minister .
in the current parliament , the pis has 150 seats , tusk 's party 131 and the social democrats have 55 .
since coming to power in 2005 , the government under the kaczynski brothers has presided over healthy economic growth , but has had to frequently navigate choppy political waters and has had serious disagreements with its european neighbors . complied from wire service reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i do think it would help to have some other activities while you 're waiting for your tour to start , though .
aside from that , we loved our trip to füssen and both castles . - todd knott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king ludwig ii , who built the castle , died a mysterious death in early october 1994 , my family and i spent 12 days in germany .
all of us were excited about seeing neuschwanstein .
we joined a small group for the tour and our guide was a lovely , young woman who spoke excellent english and gave a very detailed explanation of the castle and its history .
she patiently answered every question and mesmerized our son who was 15 at the time , while our daughter -lrb- then 12 -rrb- was fascinated with the furnishings , the decor , and depictions of life in the days of king ludwig ii .
our guide left us pondering the mystery of the king 's demise after telling us some of the intrigues going on at the time .
on the way down , we decided to take the horse-drawn carriage and got more history lessons from the driver and an older german couple riding with us .
the driver told us about hohenschwangau and we could see it perched majestically in the sunlight as we rode past . - gary jacobs , us neuschwanstein should be trying to do something along the lines of warwick castle in england , though warwick castle is a proper castle whilst neuschwanstein is more of a " stately home . " - matt hughes , germany i 've visited a few castles -lrb- including neuschwanstein -rrb- and ruins in germany over the past 35 years and think that the walk up is part of the experience .
why take away from the authenticity with a modern lift ?
the nearby theatre is enough modernism .
in fact , other than seeing my relatives , i love visiting germany as a tourist in part for the old architecture and cobblestone streets , something we are definitely lacking in canada . - mike schmidt , canada as i have been to neuschwanstein and schwangau , i have to say it is really important to enlarge the tourist interest in these shrines of culture .
a museum of the royal family might contribute to a better understanding of all the subjects involved .
the king believed in the role of the arts , believed in architecture and in the active role of man in nature , which for him was creating neuschwanstein .
we can learn a lot from it for our own life . - anna safra , israel back in 1984 i had a chance to visit my birthplace in germany .
to my great pleasure i was able to visit neuschwanstein .
although it was a cold and wet april morning , the sight of neuschwanstein is something i will never forget .

the prime minister himself later confirmed that his governing party could no longer govern either with his junior partners , nor without them .
" i see no possibility of supporting a minority government , and we do n't want to have the kind of government we have had recently , " he said at a press conference .
he hinted at the dismissal of two cabinet members , but gave no details .
the eu 's biggest former communist country has been in political turmoil for months and speculation has been rife that kaczynski would end up calling for elections to be held two years early .
speaking after earlier talks with kaczynski , the head of the radical league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , roman giertych , had told journalists on saturday that " the prime minister told me that he was breaking the coalition with the lpr and that lpr ministers would be dismissed on monday . "
the ministers of the populist sambroona party , which has already announced it is quitting the government , would also be fired , giertych added .
" mounting chaos " bitter infighting has sparked a political crisis within the coalition headed by kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
the prime minister 's twin brother , president lech kaczynski , and opposition leader donald tusk agreed on thursday that it was " inevitable " that elections scheduled for 2009 would have to be brought forward , most probably to october .
it was time to end the " mounting chaos , " tusk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrzej lepper the pis leadership meeting saturday was expected to make a decision on calling early polls , which kaczynski has more than once brandished as a threat to bring his coalition partners into line .
the two junior parties are uncertain of receiving more than five percent of the vote - the hurdle required for seats in parliament - and are therefore wary of an early ballot .
but such a move would also spell problems for the pis , which according to opinion polls only has some 23 percent support , compared with 33 percent for tusk 's civic platform .
adam lipinski , the deputy pis leader , said friday that he did not envisage a future coalition with tusk 's party , which was narrowly defeated in the 2005 elections .
corruption allegations the existing coalition first fell apart last september when kaczynski fired andrzej lepper , the deputy premier and leader of samoobrona , amid a budget and defence policy dispute .
he was forced to take lepper back three weeks later to stave off early elections , in the face of poor poll ratings .
the latest crisis erupted in early july , when the premier again sacked lepper over corruption allegations , and samoobrona said it was leaving the coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski and andrzej lepper in happier days lepper denies the charges against him , and has threatened to level unspecified allegations of wrongdoing against the prime minister .
in the current parliament , the pis has 150 seats , tusk 's party 131 and the social democrats have 55 .

the prime minister himself later confirmed that his governing party could no longer govern either with his junior partners , nor without them .
" i see no possibility of supporting a minority government , and we do n't want to have the kind of government we have had recently , " he said at a press conference .
he hinted at the dismissal of two cabinet members , but gave no details .
the eu 's biggest former communist country has been in political turmoil for months and speculation has been rife that kaczynski would end up calling for elections to be held two years early .
speaking after earlier talks with kaczynski , the head of the radical league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , roman giertych , had told journalists on saturday that " the prime minister told me that he was breaking the coalition with the lpr and that lpr ministers would be dismissed on monday . "
the ministers of the populist sambroona party , which has already announced it is quitting the government , would also be fired , giertych added .
" mounting chaos " bitter infighting has sparked a political crisis within the coalition headed by kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
the prime minister 's twin brother , president lech kaczynski , and opposition leader donald tusk agreed on thursday that it was " inevitable " that elections scheduled for 2009 would have to be brought forward , most probably to october .
it was time to end the " mounting chaos , " tusk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrzej lepper the pis leadership meeting saturday was expected to make a decision on calling early polls , which kaczynski has more than once brandished as a threat to bring his coalition partners into line .
the two junior parties are uncertain of receiving more than five percent of the vote - the hurdle required for seats in parliament - and are therefore wary of an early ballot .
but such a move would also spell problems for the pis , which according to opinion polls only has some 23 percent support , compared with 33 percent for tusk 's civic platform .
adam lipinski , the deputy pis leader , said friday that he did not envisage a future coalition with tusk 's party , which was narrowly defeated in the 2005 elections .
corruption allegations the existing coalition first fell apart last september when kaczynski fired andrzej lepper , the deputy premier and leader of samoobrona , amid a budget and defence policy dispute .
he was forced to take lepper back three weeks later to stave off early elections , in the face of poor poll ratings .
the latest crisis erupted in early july , when the premier again sacked lepper over corruption allegations , and samoobrona said it was leaving the coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski and andrzej lepper in happier days lepper denies the charges against him , and has threatened to level unspecified allegations of wrongdoing against the prime minister .
in the current parliament , the pis has 150 seats , tusk 's party 131 and the social democrats have 55 .
since coming to power in 2005 , the government under the kaczynski brothers has presided over healthy economic growth , but has had to frequently navigate choppy political waters and has had serious disagreements with its european neighbors . complied from wire service reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 've achieved what few of their colleagues ever will : broken into the english-language book market . in klaus baumgart 's picture book " laura 's star , " the main character laura learns that friends are always there even when you do n't see them .
the book has captivated children around the globe and been made into a movie .
the book 's publisher , frankfurt 's baumhaus-verlag , says it has sold 1.5 million copies , more than half a million in britain and the us alone .
" it 's actually rather rare that a german license sells so well in the english language , " said dawn lacy , who 's responsible for the foreign rights to the baumhaus-verlag 's books .
one of the reasons it 's so seldom is that the english-language book market is especially difficult to break into .
since so many authors write in english there 's little impetus for british or american publishers to look beyond their own countries .
" unfortunately it 's still the case that most english and american publishers do n't have any german-speaking editors , " renate reichstein of the oetinger publishing house said .
their approach to the language barrier was : " we ca n't do it so we do n't need it , " she added .
success story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke has published more than 40 books but success transcended borders years ago for cornelia funke , the author of the " inkheart " and " dragon rider " children 's books .
equipped with a translation of one of her manuscripts done by a cousin in england , she managed to get her foot in the door , according to reichstein .
her books have been bestsellers well beyond the german-language book market . hollywood has picked up " inkheart " and made a film which will be released in 2008 .
though funke 's success in the anglo-american book market has been one of a few exceptions , it has had positive knock-on effects for writers back home in germany .
publishers outside of germany have recognized that german authors also know how to spin gripping tales that do n't " wag a pedagogical finger " or come across as " typically german , but who just want to awaken a passion to read , " said eva kutter of fischer schatzinsel publishers .
demand grows around twice as many licenses for german-language children and teen literature were sold to foreign countries in 2006 than in 2001 , according to germany 's book trade association .
all told , 2,300 foreign licenses were sold for german-language literature for children and teens last year , far more than for adult fiction .
the increase , however , also reflected the fact that german publishers have been granting more licenses generally .
and those licenses have n't only gone to english-speaking countries .
asian publishers were especially eager to print german children 's and teen literature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " inkheart " movie , with actor brendan fraser , is set to hit screens in april 2008 eastern europe is also growing in importance , reichstein said : " this market has been exciting since the collapse of the soviet union and the associated revival of regional languages that are now rediscovering their own identity and do n't have enough authors .
in this transitional phase they buy up a lot and have it translated . "

the method uses the difference between a body 's surface temperature and the temperature of the surrounding environment .
the system works through thermoelectric generators , which are semiconductors that produce electrical energy from the temperature difference between a hot and cold environment .
large temperature difference needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the difference between a body 's surface and the enviroment is usually only a few degrees to generate one or two volts of power , needed to drive most electronic devices , the difference between the body surface and the environment needs to be 20 degrees or more .
on average , the divergence is only a few degrees .
" only low voltages can be produced from differences like these , " said project leader peter spies .
standard thermoelectric generators supply roughly 200 millivolts , so researchers experimented with components to create circuits that can operate on voltages that low .
body batteries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she might not need a battery for her cell phone in the future " this has enabled us to build entire electronic systems that do not require an internal battery , but draw their energy from body heat alone , " spies said , adding that with improvements to the system , a temperature difference of only 0.5 degrees will be enough to produce electricity .
" electricity can be generated from heat at any place where a temperature difference occurs , " he said .
in the future , he added , it might be possible to make a call from a cell phone with no battery , using just the warmth of one 's hand . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

readers told us about their trips to mad king ludwig 's legendary castle . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have necessarily been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since i worked for walt disney world for over 11 years , neuschwanstein was always an interest to me .
neuschwanstein had given walt the idea for the castle at walt disney world and i was so eager to visit it in person .
i was not disappointed and actually a bit impressed , for it is an imposing site .
it also brought me back to my disney days of employment and i could see why walt was inspired by neuschwanstein . - gregory f. knight , germany while in germany last summer for a two-week vacation , we took a tour of neuschwanstein castle and were totally blown away by the sheer size and beauty of king ludwig 's dream castle .
i loved every aspect of the tour , with the exception of the 90-minute wait , but it was well worth it as the view from the marienbrücke was absolutely amazing .
i do think it would help to have some other activities while you 're waiting for your tour to start , though .
aside from that , we loved our trip to füssen and both castles . - todd knott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king ludwig ii , who built the castle , died a mysterious death in early october 1994 , my family and i spent 12 days in germany .
all of us were excited about seeing neuschwanstein .
we joined a small group for the tour and our guide was a lovely , young woman who spoke excellent english and gave a very detailed explanation of the castle and its history .

readers told us about their trips to mad king ludwig 's legendary castle . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have necessarily been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since i worked for walt disney world for over 11 years , neuschwanstein was always an interest to me .
neuschwanstein had given walt the idea for the castle at walt disney world and i was so eager to visit it in person .
i was not disappointed and actually a bit impressed , for it is an imposing site .
it also brought me back to my disney days of employment and i could see why walt was inspired by neuschwanstein . - gregory f. knight , germany while in germany last summer for a two-week vacation , we took a tour of neuschwanstein castle and were totally blown away by the sheer size and beauty of king ludwig 's dream castle .
i loved every aspect of the tour , with the exception of the 90-minute wait , but it was well worth it as the view from the marienbrücke was absolutely amazing .
i do think it would help to have some other activities while you 're waiting for your tour to start , though .
aside from that , we loved our trip to füssen and both castles . - todd knott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king ludwig ii , who built the castle , died a mysterious death in early october 1994 , my family and i spent 12 days in germany .
all of us were excited about seeing neuschwanstein .
we joined a small group for the tour and our guide was a lovely , young woman who spoke excellent english and gave a very detailed explanation of the castle and its history .
she patiently answered every question and mesmerized our son who was 15 at the time , while our daughter -lrb- then 12 -rrb- was fascinated with the furnishings , the decor , and depictions of life in the days of king ludwig ii .
our guide left us pondering the mystery of the king 's demise after telling us some of the intrigues going on at the time .
on the way down , we decided to take the horse-drawn carriage and got more history lessons from the driver and an older german couple riding with us .
the driver told us about hohenschwangau and we could see it perched majestically in the sunlight as we rode past . - gary jacobs , us neuschwanstein should be trying to do something along the lines of warwick castle in england , though warwick castle is a proper castle whilst neuschwanstein is more of a " stately home .

why take away from the authenticity with a modern lift ?
the nearby theatre is enough modernism .
in fact , other than seeing my relatives , i love visiting germany as a tourist in part for the old architecture and cobblestone streets , something we are definitely lacking in canada . - mike schmidt , canada as i have been to neuschwanstein and schwangau , i have to say it is really important to enlarge the tourist interest in these shrines of culture .
a museum of the royal family might contribute to a better understanding of all the subjects involved .
the king believed in the role of the arts , believed in architecture and in the active role of man in nature , which for him was creating neuschwanstein .
we can learn a lot from it for our own life . - anna safra , israel back in 1984 i had a chance to visit my birthplace in germany .
to my great pleasure i was able to visit neuschwanstein .

readers told us about their trips to mad king ludwig 's legendary castle . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have necessarily been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since i worked for walt disney world for over 11 years , neuschwanstein was always an interest to me .
neuschwanstein had given walt the idea for the castle at walt disney world and i was so eager to visit it in person .
i was not disappointed and actually a bit impressed , for it is an imposing site .
it also brought me back to my disney days of employment and i could see why walt was inspired by neuschwanstein . - gregory f. knight , germany while in germany last summer for a two-week vacation , we took a tour of neuschwanstein castle and were totally blown away by the sheer size and beauty of king ludwig 's dream castle .
i loved every aspect of the tour , with the exception of the 90-minute wait , but it was well worth it as the view from the marienbrücke was absolutely amazing .
i do think it would help to have some other activities while you 're waiting for your tour to start , though .
aside from that , we loved our trip to füssen and both castles . - todd knott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king ludwig ii , who built the castle , died a mysterious death in early october 1994 , my family and i spent 12 days in germany .
all of us were excited about seeing neuschwanstein .
we joined a small group for the tour and our guide was a lovely , young woman who spoke excellent english and gave a very detailed explanation of the castle and its history .
she patiently answered every question and mesmerized our son who was 15 at the time , while our daughter -lrb- then 12 -rrb- was fascinated with the furnishings , the decor , and depictions of life in the days of king ludwig ii .
our guide left us pondering the mystery of the king 's demise after telling us some of the intrigues going on at the time .
on the way down , we decided to take the horse-drawn carriage and got more history lessons from the driver and an older german couple riding with us .
the driver told us about hohenschwangau and we could see it perched majestically in the sunlight as we rode past . - gary jacobs , us neuschwanstein should be trying to do something along the lines of warwick castle in england , though warwick castle is a proper castle whilst neuschwanstein is more of a " stately home . " - matt hughes , germany i 've visited a few castles -lrb- including neuschwanstein -rrb- and ruins in germany over the past 35 years and think that the walk up is part of the experience .
why take away from the authenticity with a modern lift ?
the nearby theatre is enough modernism .
in fact , other than seeing my relatives , i love visiting germany as a tourist in part for the old architecture and cobblestone streets , something we are definitely lacking in canada . - mike schmidt , canada as i have been to neuschwanstein and schwangau , i have to say it is really important to enlarge the tourist interest in these shrines of culture .
a museum of the royal family might contribute to a better understanding of all the subjects involved .
the king believed in the role of the arts , believed in architecture and in the active role of man in nature , which for him was creating neuschwanstein .
we can learn a lot from it for our own life . - anna safra , israel back in 1984 i had a chance to visit my birthplace in germany .
to my great pleasure i was able to visit neuschwanstein .
although it was a cold and wet april morning , the sight of neuschwanstein is something i will never forget .
its majestic surroundings have not been fully captured in film and movies .
only in person can it be fully appreciated . - robert gay , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de royal descendants take on tourism at neuschwanstein castle bavaria 's neuschwanstein castle is flooded by tourists , but there 's little to do for visitors once they 've checked out the world-famous building .
descendants of the former royal family are now trying to change that .
-lrb- 03.08.2007 -rrb- neuschwanstein castle modernized for visitors the fairytale castle in lower bavaria has revamped its visitor program to allow more people access to eccentric king ludwig 's dazzling , larger-than-life vacation home .

andrei markovits , an american expert on germany , says politics is just one of the many spheres where europeans oppose the big and powerful united states . andrei markovits is the karl w. deutsch collegiate professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , ann arbor .
he has written several books on germany and recently published " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " dw-world.de : why does europe dislike america ? andrei markovits : it certainly has many historical reasons .
the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .
but , of course , nobody likes a rich uncle . bush and iraq aside , would the relationship be comparable to a family : older siblings being jealous of a baby ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncle sam - still a baby ?
the baby grows up , and becomes the rich uncle .
the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .
this goes on all the time .
it is a general discourse , which i do n't think will disappear anytime soon . louisa schaefer interviewed andrei markovits -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 11.08.2007 expert : roots of europe 's resentment of us go back centuries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have resented americans since the latters declared independence europeans have developed a high level of anti-americanism .
andrei markovits , an american expert on germany , says politics is just one of the many spheres where europeans oppose the big and powerful united states . andrei markovits is the karl w. deutsch collegiate professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , ann arbor .
he has written several books on germany and recently published " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " dw-world.de : why does europe dislike america ? andrei markovits : it certainly has many historical reasons .
the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .
but , of course , nobody likes a rich uncle . bush and iraq aside , would the relationship be comparable to a family : older siblings being jealous of a baby ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncle sam - still a baby ?
the baby grows up , and becomes the rich uncle .
the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .
this goes on all the time .
it is a general discourse , which i do n't think will disappear anytime soon . louisa schaefer interviewed andrei markovits -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expert : iraq not the only reason for german anti-americanism five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown .
-lrb- 08.08.2007 -rrb- surveys show us image plummeting in germany five years after former german chancellor schröder refused to join the us in its invasion of iraq , surveys show that the continuing bloody conflict there has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .
-lrb- 08.08.2007 -rrb- in book , schröder describes worries about bush 's religiosity ahead of the release of his memoirs , gerhard schröder says george bush left a positive impression on him , but the us leader 's constant references to god troubled him .
schröder had few kind words for his own successor .

they 've achieved what few of their colleagues ever will : broken into the english-language book market . in klaus baumgart 's picture book " laura 's star , " the main character laura learns that friends are always there even when you do n't see them .
the book has captivated children around the globe and been made into a movie .
the book 's publisher , frankfurt 's baumhaus-verlag , says it has sold 1.5 million copies , more than half a million in britain and the us alone .
" it 's actually rather rare that a german license sells so well in the english language , " said dawn lacy , who 's responsible for the foreign rights to the baumhaus-verlag 's books .
one of the reasons it 's so seldom is that the english-language book market is especially difficult to break into .
since so many authors write in english there 's little impetus for british or american publishers to look beyond their own countries .
" unfortunately it 's still the case that most english and american publishers do n't have any german-speaking editors , " renate reichstein of the oetinger publishing house said .
their approach to the language barrier was : " we ca n't do it so we do n't need it , " she added .
success story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke has published more than 40 books but success transcended borders years ago for cornelia funke , the author of the " inkheart " and " dragon rider " children 's books .
equipped with a translation of one of her manuscripts done by a cousin in england , she managed to get her foot in the door , according to reichstein .
her books have been bestsellers well beyond the german-language book market . hollywood has picked up " inkheart " and made a film which will be released in 2008 .
though funke 's success in the anglo-american book market has been one of a few exceptions , it has had positive knock-on effects for writers back home in germany .
publishers outside of germany have recognized that german authors also know how to spin gripping tales that do n't " wag a pedagogical finger " or come across as " typically german , but who just want to awaken a passion to read , " said eva kutter of fischer schatzinsel publishers .
demand grows around twice as many licenses for german-language children and teen literature were sold to foreign countries in 2006 than in 2001 , according to germany 's book trade association .
all told , 2,300 foreign licenses were sold for german-language literature for children and teens last year , far more than for adult fiction .
the increase , however , also reflected the fact that german publishers have been granting more licenses generally .
and those licenses have n't only gone to english-speaking countries .
asian publishers were especially eager to print german children 's and teen literature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " inkheart " movie , with actor brendan fraser , is set to hit screens in april 2008 eastern europe is also growing in importance , reichstein said : " this market has been exciting since the collapse of the soviet union and the associated revival of regional languages that are now rediscovering their own identity and do n't have enough authors .
in this transitional phase they buy up a lot and have it translated . "

andrei markovits , an american expert on germany , says politics is just one of the many spheres where europeans oppose the big and powerful united states . andrei markovits is the karl w. deutsch collegiate professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , ann arbor .
he has written several books on germany and recently published " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " dw-world.de : why does europe dislike america ? andrei markovits : it certainly has many historical reasons .
the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .
but , of course , nobody likes a rich uncle . bush and iraq aside , would the relationship be comparable to a family : older siblings being jealous of a baby ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncle sam - still a baby ?
the baby grows up , and becomes the rich uncle .
the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .
this goes on all the time .

the method uses the difference between a body 's surface temperature and the temperature of the surrounding environment .
the system works through thermoelectric generators , which are semiconductors that produce electrical energy from the temperature difference between a hot and cold environment .
large temperature difference needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the difference between a body 's surface and the enviroment is usually only a few degrees to generate one or two volts of power , needed to drive most electronic devices , the difference between the body surface and the environment needs to be 20 degrees or more .
on average , the divergence is only a few degrees .
" only low voltages can be produced from differences like these , " said project leader peter spies .
standard thermoelectric generators supply roughly 200 millivolts , so researchers experimented with components to create circuits that can operate on voltages that low .
body batteries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she might not need a battery for her cell phone in the future " this has enabled us to build entire electronic systems that do not require an internal battery , but draw their energy from body heat alone , " spies said , adding that with improvements to the system , a temperature difference of only 0.5 degrees will be enough to produce electricity .
" electricity can be generated from heat at any place where a temperature difference occurs , " he said .
in the future , he added , it might be possible to make a call from a cell phone with no battery , using just the warmth of one 's hand . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .
this goes on all the time .
it is a general discourse , which i do n't think will disappear anytime soon . louisa schaefer interviewed andrei markovits -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expert : iraq not the only reason for german anti-americanism five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown .
-lrb- 08.08.2007 -rrb- surveys show us image plummeting in germany five years after former german chancellor schröder refused to join the us in its invasion of iraq , surveys show that the continuing bloody conflict there has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .
-lrb- 08.08.2007 -rrb- in book , schröder describes worries about bush 's religiosity ahead of the release of his memoirs , gerhard schröder says george bush left a positive impression on him , but the us leader 's constant references to god troubled him .
schröder had few kind words for his own successor .

the method uses the difference between a body 's surface temperature and the temperature of the surrounding environment .
the system works through thermoelectric generators , which are semiconductors that produce electrical energy from the temperature difference between a hot and cold environment .

andrei markovits , an american expert on germany , says politics is just one of the many spheres where europeans oppose the big and powerful united states . andrei markovits is the karl w. deutsch collegiate professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , ann arbor .
he has written several books on germany and recently published " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " dw-world.de : why does europe dislike america ? andrei markovits : it certainly has many historical reasons .
the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .
but , of course , nobody likes a rich uncle . bush and iraq aside , would the relationship be comparable to a family : older siblings being jealous of a baby ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncle sam - still a baby ?
the baby grows up , and becomes the rich uncle .
the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .
this goes on all the time .
it is a general discourse , which i do n't think will disappear anytime soon . louisa schaefer interviewed andrei markovits -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

andrei markovits , an american expert on germany , says politics is just one of the many spheres where europeans oppose the big and powerful united states . andrei markovits is the karl w. deutsch collegiate professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , ann arbor .
he has written several books on germany and recently published " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " dw-world.de : why does europe dislike america ? andrei markovits : it certainly has many historical reasons .
the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .
but , of course , nobody likes a rich uncle . bush and iraq aside , would the relationship be comparable to a family : older siblings being jealous of a baby ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncle sam - still a baby ?
the baby grows up , and becomes the rich uncle .
the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .
this goes on all the time .
it is a general discourse , which i do n't think will disappear anytime soon . louisa schaefer interviewed andrei markovits -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his efforts have even gotten him death threats . philipp plein has become famous in china due to his provocative t-shirt design , but the 29-year-old german is less than completely happy about his fame - maybe notoriety would be a better word . plein said he came up with the idea to print the words " f-u-c-k you china " on t-shirts after being struck and irritated by rampant chinese product piracy .
he wanted to prevent a product-pirate from copying his work . he printed the words " manufactured in europe , produced and designed by philipp plein . " under that was a drawing of a chinese man that might be seen as portraying a negative stereotype or even considered racist by some . he had 100 of those t-shirts made and as of yet , no imitations have hit the market . the " neo-fashion-nazi " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial logo but the idea did n't go over too well in china .
a chinese college student saw the t-shirt in a clothing store in bremen and wrote about it on chinese internet forums . people in china then started collecting signatures against plein , who was promptly nicknamed " neo-fashion-nazi . " it did not take long for an anti-plein web site to be set up . many chinese web sites suggested that their countrymen in germany are seen as second-class citizens .
they inundated the plein 's company with phone calls and e-mails .
many callers simply screamed vulgarities at him before hanging up the phone .
plein and his co-workers even received death threats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this woman 's purse is an original by philipp plein an explanation that the logo actually stood for " the fascinating and urban collection : kiss you china " did not placate the chinese : some proposed the idea of boycotting all german products . the t-shirt affair not only resulted in people 's disgust and some nasty name-calling - a few high-level spats have grown out of it .
chinese diplomats in germany called on plein to recall the t-shirts that were still in stores and destroy them . press conference cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the favorites when it comes to designer piracy : louis vuitton purses and bags plein felt he needed to act , but he cancelled a press conference planned in munich at the end of july .
instead of speaking out personally about the incident and apologizing publicly , plein apologized through a press release . an important photo shooting kept him away , said plein 's spokesperson .
" photographers , models , etc. were already booked , " he said . in the press release , plein said that at no time had he purposely wanted to offend the chinese people .
the logo on his t-shirt was neither a political nor a racist or discriminatory statement , he said . dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

readers told us about their trips to mad king ludwig 's legendary castle . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have necessarily been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since i worked for walt disney world for over 11 years , neuschwanstein was always an interest to me .
neuschwanstein had given walt the idea for the castle at walt disney world and i was so eager to visit it in person .
i was not disappointed and actually a bit impressed , for it is an imposing site .
it also brought me back to my disney days of employment and i could see why walt was inspired by neuschwanstein . - gregory f. knight , germany while in germany last summer for a two-week vacation , we took a tour of neuschwanstein castle and were totally blown away by the sheer size and beauty of king ludwig 's dream castle .
i loved every aspect of the tour , with the exception of the 90-minute wait , but it was well worth it as the view from the marienbrücke was absolutely amazing .
i do think it would help to have some other activities while you 're waiting for your tour to start , though .
aside from that , we loved our trip to füssen and both castles . - todd knott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king ludwig ii , who built the castle , died a mysterious death in early october 1994 , my family and i spent 12 days in germany .
all of us were excited about seeing neuschwanstein .
we joined a small group for the tour and our guide was a lovely , young woman who spoke excellent english and gave a very detailed explanation of the castle and its history .
she patiently answered every question and mesmerized our son who was 15 at the time , while our daughter -lrb- then 12 -rrb- was fascinated with the furnishings , the decor , and depictions of life in the days of king ludwig ii .
our guide left us pondering the mystery of the king 's demise after telling us some of the intrigues going on at the time .
on the way down , we decided to take the horse-drawn carriage and got more history lessons from the driver and an older german couple riding with us .
the driver told us about hohenschwangau and we could see it perched majestically in the sunlight as we rode past . - gary jacobs , us neuschwanstein should be trying to do something along the lines of warwick castle in england , though warwick castle is a proper castle whilst neuschwanstein is more of a " stately home . " - matt hughes , germany i 've visited a few castles -lrb- including neuschwanstein -rrb- and ruins in germany over the past 35 years and think that the walk up is part of the experience .
why take away from the authenticity with a modern lift ?
the nearby theatre is enough modernism .
in fact , other than seeing my relatives , i love visiting germany as a tourist in part for the old architecture and cobblestone streets , something we are definitely lacking in canada . - mike schmidt , canada as i have been to neuschwanstein and schwangau , i have to say it is really important to enlarge the tourist interest in these shrines of culture .
a museum of the royal family might contribute to a better understanding of all the subjects involved .
the king believed in the role of the arts , believed in architecture and in the active role of man in nature , which for him was creating neuschwanstein .
we can learn a lot from it for our own life . - anna safra , israel back in 1984 i had a chance to visit my birthplace in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 11.08.2007 german writers beat english barrier with kids ' books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " laura 's star " was a successful book before it was made into a movie thanks to klaus baumgart , cornelia funke and a handful of other writers , kids read german books worldwide .
they 've achieved what few of their colleagues ever will : broken into the english-language book market . in klaus baumgart 's picture book " laura 's star , " the main character laura learns that friends are always there even when you do n't see them .
the book has captivated children around the globe and been made into a movie .
the book 's publisher , frankfurt 's baumhaus-verlag , says it has sold 1.5 million copies , more than half a million in britain and the us alone .
" it 's actually rather rare that a german license sells so well in the english language , " said dawn lacy , who 's responsible for the foreign rights to the baumhaus-verlag 's books .
one of the reasons it 's so seldom is that the english-language book market is especially difficult to break into .
since so many authors write in english there 's little impetus for british or american publishers to look beyond their own countries .
" unfortunately it 's still the case that most english and american publishers do n't have any german-speaking editors , " renate reichstein of the oetinger publishing house said .
their approach to the language barrier was : " we ca n't do it so we do n't need it , " she added .
success story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke has published more than 40 books but success transcended borders years ago for cornelia funke , the author of the " inkheart " and " dragon rider " children 's books .
equipped with a translation of one of her manuscripts done by a cousin in england , she managed to get her foot in the door , according to reichstein .
her books have been bestsellers well beyond the german-language book market . hollywood has picked up " inkheart " and made a film which will be released in 2008 .
though funke 's success in the anglo-american book market has been one of a few exceptions , it has had positive knock-on effects for writers back home in germany .
publishers outside of germany have recognized that german authors also know how to spin gripping tales that do n't " wag a pedagogical finger " or come across as " typically german , but who just want to awaken a passion to read , " said eva kutter of fischer schatzinsel publishers .
demand grows around twice as many licenses for german-language children and teen literature were sold to foreign countries in 2006 than in 2001 , according to germany 's book trade association .
all told , 2,300 foreign licenses were sold for german-language literature for children and teens last year , far more than for adult fiction .
the increase , however , also reflected the fact that german publishers have been granting more licenses generally .
and those licenses have n't only gone to english-speaking countries .
asian publishers were especially eager to print german children 's and teen literature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " inkheart " movie , with actor brendan fraser , is set to hit screens in april 2008 eastern europe is also growing in importance , reichstein said : " this market has been exciting since the collapse of the soviet union and the associated revival of regional languages that are now rediscovering their own identity and do n't have enough authors .
in this transitional phase they buy up a lot and have it translated . "
publishers agree that there 's no recipe for success .
but one formula has triumphed over and over again : strong characters in stories that are told with affection and can be understood the world over - like the tale of laura learning about friendship . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the prime minister himself later confirmed that his governing party could no longer govern either with his junior partners , nor without them .
" i see no possibility of supporting a minority government , and we do n't want to have the kind of government we have had recently , " he said at a press conference .
he hinted at the dismissal of two cabinet members , but gave no details .
the eu 's biggest former communist country has been in political turmoil for months and speculation has been rife that kaczynski would end up calling for elections to be held two years early .
speaking after earlier talks with kaczynski , the head of the radical league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , roman giertych , had told journalists on saturday that " the prime minister told me that he was breaking the coalition with the lpr and that lpr ministers would be dismissed on monday . "
the ministers of the populist sambroona party , which has already announced it is quitting the government , would also be fired , giertych added .
" mounting chaos " bitter infighting has sparked a political crisis within the coalition headed by kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
the prime minister 's twin brother , president lech kaczynski , and opposition leader donald tusk agreed on thursday that it was " inevitable " that elections scheduled for 2009 would have to be brought forward , most probably to october .
it was time to end the " mounting chaos , " tusk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrzej lepper the pis leadership meeting saturday was expected to make a decision on calling early polls , which kaczynski has more than once brandished as a threat to bring his coalition partners into line .
the two junior parties are uncertain of receiving more than five percent of the vote - the hurdle required for seats in parliament - and are therefore wary of an early ballot .
but such a move would also spell problems for the pis , which according to opinion polls only has some 23 percent support , compared with 33 percent for tusk 's civic platform .
adam lipinski , the deputy pis leader , said friday that he did not envisage a future coalition with tusk 's party , which was narrowly defeated in the 2005 elections .
corruption allegations the existing coalition first fell apart last september when kaczynski fired andrzej lepper , the deputy premier and leader of samoobrona , amid a budget and defence policy dispute .
he was forced to take lepper back three weeks later to stave off early elections , in the face of poor poll ratings .
the latest crisis erupted in early july , when the premier again sacked lepper over corruption allegations , and samoobrona said it was leaving the coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski and andrzej lepper in happier days lepper denies the charges against him , and has threatened to level unspecified allegations of wrongdoing against the prime minister .
in the current parliament , the pis has 150 seats , tusk 's party 131 and the social democrats have 55 .
since coming to power in 2005 , the government under the kaczynski brothers has presided over healthy economic growth , but has had to frequently navigate choppy political waters and has had serious disagreements with its european neighbors . complied from wire service reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the prime minister himself later confirmed that his governing party could no longer govern either with his junior partners , nor without them .
" i see no possibility of supporting a minority government , and we do n't want to have the kind of government we have had recently , " he said at a press conference .
he hinted at the dismissal of two cabinet members , but gave no details .
the eu 's biggest former communist country has been in political turmoil for months and speculation has been rife that kaczynski would end up calling for elections to be held two years early .
speaking after earlier talks with kaczynski , the head of the radical league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , roman giertych , had told journalists on saturday that " the prime minister told me that he was breaking the coalition with the lpr and that lpr ministers would be dismissed on monday . "
the ministers of the populist sambroona party , which has already announced it is quitting the government , would also be fired , giertych added .
" mounting chaos " bitter infighting has sparked a political crisis within the coalition headed by kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
the prime minister 's twin brother , president lech kaczynski , and opposition leader donald tusk agreed on thursday that it was " inevitable " that elections scheduled for 2009 would have to be brought forward , most probably to october .
it was time to end the " mounting chaos , " tusk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrzej lepper the pis leadership meeting saturday was expected to make a decision on calling early polls , which kaczynski has more than once brandished as a threat to bring his coalition partners into line .
the two junior parties are uncertain of receiving more than five percent of the vote - the hurdle required for seats in parliament - and are therefore wary of an early ballot .
but such a move would also spell problems for the pis , which according to opinion polls only has some 23 percent support , compared with 33 percent for tusk 's civic platform .
adam lipinski , the deputy pis leader , said friday that he did not envisage a future coalition with tusk 's party , which was narrowly defeated in the 2005 elections .
corruption allegations the existing coalition first fell apart last september when kaczynski fired andrzej lepper , the deputy premier and leader of samoobrona , amid a budget and defence policy dispute .
he was forced to take lepper back three weeks later to stave off early elections , in the face of poor poll ratings .
the latest crisis erupted in early july , when the premier again sacked lepper over corruption allegations , and samoobrona said it was leaving the coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski and andrzej lepper in happier days lepper denies the charges against him , and has threatened to level unspecified allegations of wrongdoing against the prime minister .
in the current parliament , the pis has 150 seats , tusk 's party 131 and the social democrats have 55 .

his efforts have even gotten him death threats . philipp plein has become famous in china due to his provocative t-shirt design , but the 29-year-old german is less than completely happy about his fame - maybe notoriety would be a better word . plein said he came up with the idea to print the words " f-u-c-k you china " on t-shirts after being struck and irritated by rampant chinese product piracy .
he wanted to prevent a product-pirate from copying his work . he printed the words " manufactured in europe , produced and designed by philipp plein . " under that was a drawing of a chinese man that might be seen as portraying a negative stereotype or even considered racist by some . he had 100 of those t-shirts made and as of yet , no imitations have hit the market . the " neo-fashion-nazi " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial logo but the idea did n't go over too well in china .
a chinese college student saw the t-shirt in a clothing store in bremen and wrote about it on chinese internet forums . people in china then started collecting signatures against plein , who was promptly nicknamed " neo-fashion-nazi . " it did not take long for an anti-plein web site to be set up . many chinese web sites suggested that their countrymen in germany are seen as second-class citizens .

they 've achieved what few of their colleagues ever will : broken into the english-language book market . in klaus baumgart 's picture book " laura 's star , " the main character laura learns that friends are always there even when you do n't see them .
the book has captivated children around the globe and been made into a movie .
the book 's publisher , frankfurt 's baumhaus-verlag , says it has sold 1.5 million copies , more than half a million in britain and the us alone .
" it 's actually rather rare that a german license sells so well in the english language , " said dawn lacy , who 's responsible for the foreign rights to the baumhaus-verlag 's books .
one of the reasons it 's so seldom is that the english-language book market is especially difficult to break into .
since so many authors write in english there 's little impetus for british or american publishers to look beyond their own countries .
" unfortunately it 's still the case that most english and american publishers do n't have any german-speaking editors , " renate reichstein of the oetinger publishing house said .
their approach to the language barrier was : " we ca n't do it so we do n't need it , " she added .
success story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke has published more than 40 books but success transcended borders years ago for cornelia funke , the author of the " inkheart " and " dragon rider " children 's books .
equipped with a translation of one of her manuscripts done by a cousin in england , she managed to get her foot in the door , according to reichstein .
her books have been bestsellers well beyond the german-language book market . hollywood has picked up " inkheart " and made a film which will be released in 2008 .
though funke 's success in the anglo-american book market has been one of a few exceptions , it has had positive knock-on effects for writers back home in germany .
publishers outside of germany have recognized that german authors also know how to spin gripping tales that do n't " wag a pedagogical finger " or come across as " typically german , but who just want to awaken a passion to read , " said eva kutter of fischer schatzinsel publishers .
demand grows around twice as many licenses for german-language children and teen literature were sold to foreign countries in 2006 than in 2001 , according to germany 's book trade association .
all told , 2,300 foreign licenses were sold for german-language literature for children and teens last year , far more than for adult fiction .
the increase , however , also reflected the fact that german publishers have been granting more licenses generally .
and those licenses have n't only gone to english-speaking countries .
asian publishers were especially eager to print german children 's and teen literature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " inkheart " movie , with actor brendan fraser , is set to hit screens in april 2008 eastern europe is also growing in importance , reichstein said : " this market has been exciting since the collapse of the soviet union and the associated revival of regional languages that are now rediscovering their own identity and do n't have enough authors .
in this transitional phase they buy up a lot and have it translated . "
publishers agree that there 's no recipe for success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 11.08.2007 expert : roots of europe 's resentment of us go back centuries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have resented americans since the latters declared independence europeans have developed a high level of anti-americanism .
andrei markovits , an american expert on germany , says politics is just one of the many spheres where europeans oppose the big and powerful united states . andrei markovits is the karl w. deutsch collegiate professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , ann arbor .
he has written several books on germany and recently published " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " dw-world.de : why does europe dislike america ? andrei markovits : it certainly has many historical reasons .
the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .
but , of course , nobody likes a rich uncle . bush and iraq aside , would the relationship be comparable to a family : older siblings being jealous of a baby ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncle sam - still a baby ?
the baby grows up , and becomes the rich uncle .
the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .

the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .

if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .

his efforts have even gotten him death threats . philipp plein has become famous in china due to his provocative t-shirt design , but the 29-year-old german is less than completely happy about his fame - maybe notoriety would be a better word . plein said he came up with the idea to print the words " f-u-c-k you china " on t-shirts after being struck and irritated by rampant chinese product piracy .
he wanted to prevent a product-pirate from copying his work . he printed the words " manufactured in europe , produced and designed by philipp plein . " under that was a drawing of a chinese man that might be seen as portraying a negative stereotype or even considered racist by some . he had 100 of those t-shirts made and as of yet , no imitations have hit the market . the " neo-fashion-nazi " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial logo but the idea did n't go over too well in china .
a chinese college student saw the t-shirt in a clothing store in bremen and wrote about it on chinese internet forums . people in china then started collecting signatures against plein , who was promptly nicknamed " neo-fashion-nazi . " it did not take long for an anti-plein web site to be set up . many chinese web sites suggested that their countrymen in germany are seen as second-class citizens .
they inundated the plein 's company with phone calls and e-mails .
many callers simply screamed vulgarities at him before hanging up the phone .
plein and his co-workers even received death threats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this woman 's purse is an original by philipp plein an explanation that the logo actually stood for " the fascinating and urban collection : kiss you china " did not placate the chinese : some proposed the idea of boycotting all german products . the t-shirt affair not only resulted in people 's disgust and some nasty name-calling - a few high-level spats have grown out of it .
chinese diplomats in germany called on plein to recall the t-shirts that were still in stores and destroy them . press conference cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the favorites when it comes to designer piracy : louis vuitton purses and bags plein felt he needed to act , but he cancelled a press conference planned in munich at the end of july .
instead of speaking out personally about the incident and apologizing publicly , plein apologized through a press release . an important photo shooting kept him away , said plein 's spokesperson .
" photographers , models , etc. were already booked , " he said . in the press release , plein said that at no time had he purposely wanted to offend the chinese people .
the logo on his t-shirt was neither a political nor a racist or discriminatory statement , he said . dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 11.08.2007 expert : roots of europe 's resentment of us go back centuries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have resented americans since the latters declared independence europeans have developed a high level of anti-americanism .
andrei markovits , an american expert on germany , says politics is just one of the many spheres where europeans oppose the big and powerful united states . andrei markovits is the karl w. deutsch collegiate professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , ann arbor .
he has written several books on germany and recently published " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " dw-world.de : why does europe dislike america ? andrei markovits : it certainly has many historical reasons .
the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .
but , of course , nobody likes a rich uncle . bush and iraq aside , would the relationship be comparable to a family : older siblings being jealous of a baby ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncle sam - still a baby ?
the baby grows up , and becomes the rich uncle .
the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .
this goes on all the time .
it is a general discourse , which i do n't think will disappear anytime soon . louisa schaefer interviewed andrei markovits -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expert : iraq not the only reason for german anti-americanism five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown .
-lrb- 08.08.2007 -rrb- surveys show us image plummeting in germany five years after former german chancellor schröder refused to join the us in its invasion of iraq , surveys show that the continuing bloody conflict there has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .

andrei markovits , an american expert on germany , says politics is just one of the many spheres where europeans oppose the big and powerful united states . andrei markovits is the karl w. deutsch collegiate professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , ann arbor .
he has written several books on germany and recently published " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " dw-world.de : why does europe dislike america ? andrei markovits : it certainly has many historical reasons .
the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .
but , of course , nobody likes a rich uncle . bush and iraq aside , would the relationship be comparable to a family : older siblings being jealous of a baby ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncle sam - still a baby ?
the baby grows up , and becomes the rich uncle .
the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .
this goes on all the time .
it is a general discourse , which i do n't think will disappear anytime soon . louisa schaefer interviewed andrei markovits -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expert : iraq not the only reason for german anti-americanism five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .

the method uses the difference between a body 's surface temperature and the temperature of the surrounding environment .
the system works through thermoelectric generators , which are semiconductors that produce electrical energy from the temperature difference between a hot and cold environment .
large temperature difference needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the difference between a body 's surface and the enviroment is usually only a few degrees to generate one or two volts of power , needed to drive most electronic devices , the difference between the body surface and the environment needs to be 20 degrees or more .
on average , the divergence is only a few degrees .
" only low voltages can be produced from differences like these , " said project leader peter spies .
standard thermoelectric generators supply roughly 200 millivolts , so researchers experimented with components to create circuits that can operate on voltages that low .
body batteries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she might not need a battery for her cell phone in the future " this has enabled us to build entire electronic systems that do not require an internal battery , but draw their energy from body heat alone , " spies said , adding that with improvements to the system , a temperature difference of only 0.5 degrees will be enough to produce electricity .
" electricity can be generated from heat at any place where a temperature difference occurs , " he said .
in the future , he added , it might be possible to make a call from a cell phone with no battery , using just the warmth of one 's hand . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 11.08.2007 german writers beat english barrier with kids ' books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " laura 's star " was a successful book before it was made into a movie thanks to klaus baumgart , cornelia funke and a handful of other writers , kids read german books worldwide .
they 've achieved what few of their colleagues ever will : broken into the english-language book market . in klaus baumgart 's picture book " laura 's star , " the main character laura learns that friends are always there even when you do n't see them .
the book has captivated children around the globe and been made into a movie .
the book 's publisher , frankfurt 's baumhaus-verlag , says it has sold 1.5 million copies , more than half a million in britain and the us alone .
" it 's actually rather rare that a german license sells so well in the english language , " said dawn lacy , who 's responsible for the foreign rights to the baumhaus-verlag 's books .
one of the reasons it 's so seldom is that the english-language book market is especially difficult to break into .
since so many authors write in english there 's little impetus for british or american publishers to look beyond their own countries .
" unfortunately it 's still the case that most english and american publishers do n't have any german-speaking editors , " renate reichstein of the oetinger publishing house said .
their approach to the language barrier was : " we ca n't do it so we do n't need it , " she added .
success story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke has published more than 40 books but success transcended borders years ago for cornelia funke , the author of the " inkheart " and " dragon rider " children 's books .
equipped with a translation of one of her manuscripts done by a cousin in england , she managed to get her foot in the door , according to reichstein .
her books have been bestsellers well beyond the german-language book market . hollywood has picked up " inkheart " and made a film which will be released in 2008 .
though funke 's success in the anglo-american book market has been one of a few exceptions , it has had positive knock-on effects for writers back home in germany .
publishers outside of germany have recognized that german authors also know how to spin gripping tales that do n't " wag a pedagogical finger " or come across as " typically german , but who just want to awaken a passion to read , " said eva kutter of fischer schatzinsel publishers .
demand grows around twice as many licenses for german-language children and teen literature were sold to foreign countries in 2006 than in 2001 , according to germany 's book trade association .
all told , 2,300 foreign licenses were sold for german-language literature for children and teens last year , far more than for adult fiction .
the increase , however , also reflected the fact that german publishers have been granting more licenses generally .
and those licenses have n't only gone to english-speaking countries .
asian publishers were especially eager to print german children 's and teen literature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " inkheart " movie , with actor brendan fraser , is set to hit screens in april 2008 eastern europe is also growing in importance , reichstein said : " this market has been exciting since the collapse of the soviet union and the associated revival of regional languages that are now rediscovering their own identity and do n't have enough authors .
in this transitional phase they buy up a lot and have it translated . "
publishers agree that there 's no recipe for success .
but one formula has triumphed over and over again : strong characters in stories that are told with affection and can be understood the world over - like the tale of laura learning about friendship . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his efforts have even gotten him death threats . philipp plein has become famous in china due to his provocative t-shirt design , but the 29-year-old german is less than completely happy about his fame - maybe notoriety would be a better word . plein said he came up with the idea to print the words " f-u-c-k you china " on t-shirts after being struck and irritated by rampant chinese product piracy .
he wanted to prevent a product-pirate from copying his work . he printed the words " manufactured in europe , produced and designed by philipp plein . " under that was a drawing of a chinese man that might be seen as portraying a negative stereotype or even considered racist by some . he had 100 of those t-shirts made and as of yet , no imitations have hit the market . the " neo-fashion-nazi " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial logo but the idea did n't go over too well in china .
a chinese college student saw the t-shirt in a clothing store in bremen and wrote about it on chinese internet forums . people in china then started collecting signatures against plein , who was promptly nicknamed " neo-fashion-nazi . " it did not take long for an anti-plein web site to be set up . many chinese web sites suggested that their countrymen in germany are seen as second-class citizens .
they inundated the plein 's company with phone calls and e-mails .
many callers simply screamed vulgarities at him before hanging up the phone .
plein and his co-workers even received death threats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this woman 's purse is an original by philipp plein an explanation that the logo actually stood for " the fascinating and urban collection : kiss you china " did not placate the chinese : some proposed the idea of boycotting all german products . the t-shirt affair not only resulted in people 's disgust and some nasty name-calling - a few high-level spats have grown out of it .
chinese diplomats in germany called on plein to recall the t-shirts that were still in stores and destroy them . press conference cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the favorites when it comes to designer piracy : louis vuitton purses and bags plein felt he needed to act , but he cancelled a press conference planned in munich at the end of july .

" photographers , models , etc. were already booked , " he said . in the press release , plein said that at no time had he purposely wanted to offend the chinese people .

" i see no possibility of supporting a minority government , and we do n't want to have the kind of government we have had recently , " he said at a press conference .
he hinted at the dismissal of two cabinet members , but gave no details .
the eu 's biggest former communist country has been in political turmoil for months and speculation has been rife that kaczynski would end up calling for elections to be held two years early .
speaking after earlier talks with kaczynski , the head of the radical league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , roman giertych , had told journalists on saturday that " the prime minister told me that he was breaking the coalition with the lpr and that lpr ministers would be dismissed on monday . "
the ministers of the populist sambroona party , which has already announced it is quitting the government , would also be fired , giertych added .
" mounting chaos " bitter infighting has sparked a political crisis within the coalition headed by kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
the prime minister 's twin brother , president lech kaczynski , and opposition leader donald tusk agreed on thursday that it was " inevitable " that elections scheduled for 2009 would have to be brought forward , most probably to october .
it was time to end the " mounting chaos , " tusk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrzej lepper the pis leadership meeting saturday was expected to make a decision on calling early polls , which kaczynski has more than once brandished as a threat to bring his coalition partners into line .
the two junior parties are uncertain of receiving more than five percent of the vote - the hurdle required for seats in parliament - and are therefore wary of an early ballot .
but such a move would also spell problems for the pis , which according to opinion polls only has some 23 percent support , compared with 33 percent for tusk 's civic platform .
adam lipinski , the deputy pis leader , said friday that he did not envisage a future coalition with tusk 's party , which was narrowly defeated in the 2005 elections .
corruption allegations the existing coalition first fell apart last september when kaczynski fired andrzej lepper , the deputy premier and leader of samoobrona , amid a budget and defence policy dispute .
he was forced to take lepper back three weeks later to stave off early elections , in the face of poor poll ratings .
the latest crisis erupted in early july , when the premier again sacked lepper over corruption allegations , and samoobrona said it was leaving the coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski and andrzej lepper in happier days lepper denies the charges against him , and has threatened to level unspecified allegations of wrongdoing against the prime minister .
in the current parliament , the pis has 150 seats , tusk 's party 131 and the social democrats have 55 .
since coming to power in 2005 , the government under the kaczynski brothers has presided over healthy economic growth , but has had to frequently navigate choppy political waters and has had serious disagreements with its european neighbors . complied from wire service reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 've achieved what few of their colleagues ever will : broken into the english-language book market . in klaus baumgart 's picture book " laura 's star , " the main character laura learns that friends are always there even when you do n't see them .
the book has captivated children around the globe and been made into a movie .
the book 's publisher , frankfurt 's baumhaus-verlag , says it has sold 1.5 million copies , more than half a million in britain and the us alone .
" it 's actually rather rare that a german license sells so well in the english language , " said dawn lacy , who 's responsible for the foreign rights to the baumhaus-verlag 's books .
one of the reasons it 's so seldom is that the english-language book market is especially difficult to break into .
since so many authors write in english there 's little impetus for british or american publishers to look beyond their own countries .
" unfortunately it 's still the case that most english and american publishers do n't have any german-speaking editors , " renate reichstein of the oetinger publishing house said .
their approach to the language barrier was : " we ca n't do it so we do n't need it , " she added .

her books have been bestsellers well beyond the german-language book market . hollywood has picked up " inkheart " and made a film which will be released in 2008 .
though funke 's success in the anglo-american book market has been one of a few exceptions , it has had positive knock-on effects for writers back home in germany .
publishers outside of germany have recognized that german authors also know how to spin gripping tales that do n't " wag a pedagogical finger " or come across as " typically german , but who just want to awaken a passion to read , " said eva kutter of fischer schatzinsel publishers .
demand grows around twice as many licenses for german-language children and teen literature were sold to foreign countries in 2006 than in 2001 , according to germany 's book trade association .
all told , 2,300 foreign licenses were sold for german-language literature for children and teens last year , far more than for adult fiction .
the increase , however , also reflected the fact that german publishers have been granting more licenses generally .
and those licenses have n't only gone to english-speaking countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 11.08.2007 german writers beat english barrier with kids ' books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " laura 's star " was a successful book before it was made into a movie thanks to klaus baumgart , cornelia funke and a handful of other writers , kids read german books worldwide .
they 've achieved what few of their colleagues ever will : broken into the english-language book market . in klaus baumgart 's picture book " laura 's star , " the main character laura learns that friends are always there even when you do n't see them .
the book has captivated children around the globe and been made into a movie .
the book 's publisher , frankfurt 's baumhaus-verlag , says it has sold 1.5 million copies , more than half a million in britain and the us alone .
" it 's actually rather rare that a german license sells so well in the english language , " said dawn lacy , who 's responsible for the foreign rights to the baumhaus-verlag 's books .
one of the reasons it 's so seldom is that the english-language book market is especially difficult to break into .
since so many authors write in english there 's little impetus for british or american publishers to look beyond their own countries .
" unfortunately it 's still the case that most english and american publishers do n't have any german-speaking editors , " renate reichstein of the oetinger publishing house said .
their approach to the language barrier was : " we ca n't do it so we do n't need it , " she added .
success story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke has published more than 40 books but success transcended borders years ago for cornelia funke , the author of the " inkheart " and " dragon rider " children 's books .
equipped with a translation of one of her manuscripts done by a cousin in england , she managed to get her foot in the door , according to reichstein .
her books have been bestsellers well beyond the german-language book market . hollywood has picked up " inkheart " and made a film which will be released in 2008 .
though funke 's success in the anglo-american book market has been one of a few exceptions , it has had positive knock-on effects for writers back home in germany .
publishers outside of germany have recognized that german authors also know how to spin gripping tales that do n't " wag a pedagogical finger " or come across as " typically german , but who just want to awaken a passion to read , " said eva kutter of fischer schatzinsel publishers .
demand grows around twice as many licenses for german-language children and teen literature were sold to foreign countries in 2006 than in 2001 , according to germany 's book trade association .
all told , 2,300 foreign licenses were sold for german-language literature for children and teens last year , far more than for adult fiction .
the increase , however , also reflected the fact that german publishers have been granting more licenses generally .
and those licenses have n't only gone to english-speaking countries .
asian publishers were especially eager to print german children 's and teen literature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " inkheart " movie , with actor brendan fraser , is set to hit screens in april 2008 eastern europe is also growing in importance , reichstein said : " this market has been exciting since the collapse of the soviet union and the associated revival of regional languages that are now rediscovering their own identity and do n't have enough authors .
in this transitional phase they buy up a lot and have it translated . "
publishers agree that there 's no recipe for success .
but one formula has triumphed over and over again : strong characters in stories that are told with affection and can be understood the world over - like the tale of laura learning about friendship . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

readers told us about their trips to mad king ludwig 's legendary castle . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have necessarily been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since i worked for walt disney world for over 11 years , neuschwanstein was always an interest to me .
neuschwanstein had given walt the idea for the castle at walt disney world and i was so eager to visit it in person .
i was not disappointed and actually a bit impressed , for it is an imposing site .
it also brought me back to my disney days of employment and i could see why walt was inspired by neuschwanstein . - gregory f. knight , germany while in germany last summer for a two-week vacation , we took a tour of neuschwanstein castle and were totally blown away by the sheer size and beauty of king ludwig 's dream castle .
i loved every aspect of the tour , with the exception of the 90-minute wait , but it was well worth it as the view from the marienbrücke was absolutely amazing .
i do think it would help to have some other activities while you 're waiting for your tour to start , though .
aside from that , we loved our trip to füssen and both castles . - todd knott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king ludwig ii , who built the castle , died a mysterious death in early october 1994 , my family and i spent 12 days in germany .
all of us were excited about seeing neuschwanstein .
we joined a small group for the tour and our guide was a lovely , young woman who spoke excellent english and gave a very detailed explanation of the castle and its history .
she patiently answered every question and mesmerized our son who was 15 at the time , while our daughter -lrb- then 12 -rrb- was fascinated with the furnishings , the decor , and depictions of life in the days of king ludwig ii .
our guide left us pondering the mystery of the king 's demise after telling us some of the intrigues going on at the time .
on the way down , we decided to take the horse-drawn carriage and got more history lessons from the driver and an older german couple riding with us .
the driver told us about hohenschwangau and we could see it perched majestically in the sunlight as we rode past . - gary jacobs , us neuschwanstein should be trying to do something along the lines of warwick castle in england , though warwick castle is a proper castle whilst neuschwanstein is more of a " stately home . " - matt hughes , germany i 've visited a few castles -lrb- including neuschwanstein -rrb- and ruins in germany over the past 35 years and think that the walk up is part of the experience .
why take away from the authenticity with a modern lift ?
the nearby theatre is enough modernism .
in fact , other than seeing my relatives , i love visiting germany as a tourist in part for the old architecture and cobblestone streets , something we are definitely lacking in canada . - mike schmidt , canada as i have been to neuschwanstein and schwangau , i have to say it is really important to enlarge the tourist interest in these shrines of culture .
a museum of the royal family might contribute to a better understanding of all the subjects involved .
the king believed in the role of the arts , believed in architecture and in the active role of man in nature , which for him was creating neuschwanstein .
we can learn a lot from it for our own life . - anna safra , israel back in 1984 i had a chance to visit my birthplace in germany .
to my great pleasure i was able to visit neuschwanstein .
although it was a cold and wet april morning , the sight of neuschwanstein is something i will never forget .

the prime minister himself later confirmed that his governing party could no longer govern either with his junior partners , nor without them .
" i see no possibility of supporting a minority government , and we do n't want to have the kind of government we have had recently , " he said at a press conference .
he hinted at the dismissal of two cabinet members , but gave no details .
the eu 's biggest former communist country has been in political turmoil for months and speculation has been rife that kaczynski would end up calling for elections to be held two years early .
speaking after earlier talks with kaczynski , the head of the radical league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , roman giertych , had told journalists on saturday that " the prime minister told me that he was breaking the coalition with the lpr and that lpr ministers would be dismissed on monday . "
the ministers of the populist sambroona party , which has already announced it is quitting the government , would also be fired , giertych added .
" mounting chaos " bitter infighting has sparked a political crisis within the coalition headed by kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
the prime minister 's twin brother , president lech kaczynski , and opposition leader donald tusk agreed on thursday that it was " inevitable " that elections scheduled for 2009 would have to be brought forward , most probably to october .
it was time to end the " mounting chaos , " tusk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrzej lepper the pis leadership meeting saturday was expected to make a decision on calling early polls , which kaczynski has more than once brandished as a threat to bring his coalition partners into line .
the two junior parties are uncertain of receiving more than five percent of the vote - the hurdle required for seats in parliament - and are therefore wary of an early ballot .
but such a move would also spell problems for the pis , which according to opinion polls only has some 23 percent support , compared with 33 percent for tusk 's civic platform .
adam lipinski , the deputy pis leader , said friday that he did not envisage a future coalition with tusk 's party , which was narrowly defeated in the 2005 elections .
corruption allegations the existing coalition first fell apart last september when kaczynski fired andrzej lepper , the deputy premier and leader of samoobrona , amid a budget and defence policy dispute .
he was forced to take lepper back three weeks later to stave off early elections , in the face of poor poll ratings .
the latest crisis erupted in early july , when the premier again sacked lepper over corruption allegations , and samoobrona said it was leaving the coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski and andrzej lepper in happier days lepper denies the charges against him , and has threatened to level unspecified allegations of wrongdoing against the prime minister .
in the current parliament , the pis has 150 seats , tusk 's party 131 and the social democrats have 55 .
since coming to power in 2005 , the government under the kaczynski brothers has presided over healthy economic growth , but has had to frequently navigate choppy political waters and has had serious disagreements with its european neighbors . complied from wire service reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 11.08.2007 expert : roots of europe 's resentment of us go back centuries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have resented americans since the latters declared independence europeans have developed a high level of anti-americanism .
andrei markovits , an american expert on germany , says politics is just one of the many spheres where europeans oppose the big and powerful united states . andrei markovits is the karl w. deutsch collegiate professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , ann arbor .
he has written several books on germany and recently published " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " dw-world.de : why does europe dislike america ? andrei markovits : it certainly has many historical reasons .
the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .
but , of course , nobody likes a rich uncle . bush and iraq aside , would the relationship be comparable to a family : older siblings being jealous of a baby ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncle sam - still a baby ?
the baby grows up , and becomes the rich uncle .
the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .
this goes on all the time .
it is a general discourse , which i do n't think will disappear anytime soon . louisa schaefer interviewed andrei markovits -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expert : iraq not the only reason for german anti-americanism five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown .
-lrb- 08.08.2007 -rrb- surveys show us image plummeting in germany five years after former german chancellor schröder refused to join the us in its invasion of iraq , surveys show that the continuing bloody conflict there has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .
-lrb- 08.08.2007 -rrb- in book , schröder describes worries about bush 's religiosity ahead of the release of his memoirs , gerhard schröder says george bush left a positive impression on him , but the us leader 's constant references to god troubled him .
schröder had few kind words for his own successor .

andrei markovits , an american expert on germany , says politics is just one of the many spheres where europeans oppose the big and powerful united states . andrei markovits is the karl w. deutsch collegiate professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , ann arbor .
he has written several books on germany and recently published " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " dw-world.de : why does europe dislike america ? andrei markovits : it certainly has many historical reasons .
the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .
but , of course , nobody likes a rich uncle . bush and iraq aside , would the relationship be comparable to a family : older siblings being jealous of a baby ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncle sam - still a baby ?
the baby grows up , and becomes the rich uncle .
the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .
this goes on all the time .
it is a general discourse , which i do n't think will disappear anytime soon . louisa schaefer interviewed andrei markovits -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

andrei markovits , an american expert on germany , says politics is just one of the many spheres where europeans oppose the big and powerful united states . andrei markovits is the karl w. deutsch collegiate professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , ann arbor .
he has written several books on germany and recently published " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " dw-world.de : why does europe dislike america ? andrei markovits : it certainly has many historical reasons .
the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .
but , of course , nobody likes a rich uncle . bush and iraq aside , would the relationship be comparable to a family : older siblings being jealous of a baby ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncle sam - still a baby ?
the baby grows up , and becomes the rich uncle .
the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .
this goes on all the time .
it is a general discourse , which i do n't think will disappear anytime soon . louisa schaefer interviewed andrei markovits -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the method uses the difference between a body 's surface temperature and the temperature of the surrounding environment .
the system works through thermoelectric generators , which are semiconductors that produce electrical energy from the temperature difference between a hot and cold environment .
large temperature difference needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the difference between a body 's surface and the enviroment is usually only a few degrees to generate one or two volts of power , needed to drive most electronic devices , the difference between the body surface and the environment needs to be 20 degrees or more .
on average , the divergence is only a few degrees .
" only low voltages can be produced from differences like these , " said project leader peter spies .
standard thermoelectric generators supply roughly 200 millivolts , so researchers experimented with components to create circuits that can operate on voltages that low .
body batteries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she might not need a battery for her cell phone in the future " this has enabled us to build entire electronic systems that do not require an internal battery , but draw their energy from body heat alone , " spies said , adding that with improvements to the system , a temperature difference of only 0.5 degrees will be enough to produce electricity .
" electricity can be generated from heat at any place where a temperature difference occurs , " he said .
in the future , he added , it might be possible to make a call from a cell phone with no battery , using just the warmth of one 's hand . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .
but , of course , nobody likes a rich uncle . bush and iraq aside , would the relationship be comparable to a family : older siblings being jealous of a baby ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncle sam - still a baby ?
the baby grows up , and becomes the rich uncle .
the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .
this goes on all the time .
it is a general discourse , which i do n't think will disappear anytime soon . louisa schaefer interviewed andrei markovits -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expert : iraq not the only reason for german anti-americanism five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown .
-lrb- 08.08.2007 -rrb- surveys show us image plummeting in germany five years after former german chancellor schröder refused to join the us in its invasion of iraq , surveys show that the continuing bloody conflict there has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .
-lrb- 08.08.2007 -rrb- in book , schröder describes worries about bush 's religiosity ahead of the release of his memoirs , gerhard schröder says george bush left a positive impression on him , but the us leader 's constant references to god troubled him .
schröder had few kind words for his own successor .

readers told us about their trips to mad king ludwig 's legendary castle . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have necessarily been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since i worked for walt disney world for over 11 years , neuschwanstein was always an interest to me .
neuschwanstein had given walt the idea for the castle at walt disney world and i was so eager to visit it in person .
i was not disappointed and actually a bit impressed , for it is an imposing site .
it also brought me back to my disney days of employment and i could see why walt was inspired by neuschwanstein . - gregory f. knight , germany while in germany last summer for a two-week vacation , we took a tour of neuschwanstein castle and were totally blown away by the sheer size and beauty of king ludwig 's dream castle .
i loved every aspect of the tour , with the exception of the 90-minute wait , but it was well worth it as the view from the marienbrücke was absolutely amazing .
i do think it would help to have some other activities while you 're waiting for your tour to start , though .
aside from that , we loved our trip to füssen and both castles . - todd knott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king ludwig ii , who built the castle , died a mysterious death in early october 1994 , my family and i spent 12 days in germany .
all of us were excited about seeing neuschwanstein .
we joined a small group for the tour and our guide was a lovely , young woman who spoke excellent english and gave a very detailed explanation of the castle and its history .
she patiently answered every question and mesmerized our son who was 15 at the time , while our daughter -lrb- then 12 -rrb- was fascinated with the furnishings , the decor , and depictions of life in the days of king ludwig ii .
our guide left us pondering the mystery of the king 's demise after telling us some of the intrigues going on at the time .
on the way down , we decided to take the horse-drawn carriage and got more history lessons from the driver and an older german couple riding with us .
the driver told us about hohenschwangau and we could see it perched majestically in the sunlight as we rode past . - gary jacobs , us neuschwanstein should be trying to do something along the lines of warwick castle in england , though warwick castle is a proper castle whilst neuschwanstein is more of a " stately home . " - matt hughes , germany i 've visited a few castles -lrb- including neuschwanstein -rrb- and ruins in germany over the past 35 years and think that the walk up is part of the experience .
why take away from the authenticity with a modern lift ?
the nearby theatre is enough modernism .
in fact , other than seeing my relatives , i love visiting germany as a tourist in part for the old architecture and cobblestone streets , something we are definitely lacking in canada . - mike schmidt , canada as i have been to neuschwanstein and schwangau , i have to say it is really important to enlarge the tourist interest in these shrines of culture .
a museum of the royal family might contribute to a better understanding of all the subjects involved .
the king believed in the role of the arts , believed in architecture and in the active role of man in nature , which for him was creating neuschwanstein .
we can learn a lot from it for our own life . - anna safra , israel back in 1984 i had a chance to visit my birthplace in germany .
to my great pleasure i was able to visit neuschwanstein .
although it was a cold and wet april morning , the sight of neuschwanstein is something i will never forget .
its majestic surroundings have not been fully captured in film and movies .
only in person can it be fully appreciated . - robert gay , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de royal descendants take on tourism at neuschwanstein castle bavaria 's neuschwanstein castle is flooded by tourists , but there 's little to do for visitors once they 've checked out the world-famous building .

the prime minister himself later confirmed that his governing party could no longer govern either with his junior partners , nor without them .
" i see no possibility of supporting a minority government , and we do n't want to have the kind of government we have had recently , " he said at a press conference .
he hinted at the dismissal of two cabinet members , but gave no details .
the eu 's biggest former communist country has been in political turmoil for months and speculation has been rife that kaczynski would end up calling for elections to be held two years early .
speaking after earlier talks with kaczynski , the head of the radical league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , roman giertych , had told journalists on saturday that " the prime minister told me that he was breaking the coalition with the lpr and that lpr ministers would be dismissed on monday . "
the ministers of the populist sambroona party , which has already announced it is quitting the government , would also be fired , giertych added .
" mounting chaos " bitter infighting has sparked a political crisis within the coalition headed by kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
the prime minister 's twin brother , president lech kaczynski , and opposition leader donald tusk agreed on thursday that it was " inevitable " that elections scheduled for 2009 would have to be brought forward , most probably to october .
it was time to end the " mounting chaos , " tusk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrzej lepper the pis leadership meeting saturday was expected to make a decision on calling early polls , which kaczynski has more than once brandished as a threat to bring his coalition partners into line .
the two junior parties are uncertain of receiving more than five percent of the vote - the hurdle required for seats in parliament - and are therefore wary of an early ballot .
but such a move would also spell problems for the pis , which according to opinion polls only has some 23 percent support , compared with 33 percent for tusk 's civic platform .
adam lipinski , the deputy pis leader , said friday that he did not envisage a future coalition with tusk 's party , which was narrowly defeated in the 2005 elections .
corruption allegations the existing coalition first fell apart last september when kaczynski fired andrzej lepper , the deputy premier and leader of samoobrona , amid a budget and defence policy dispute .
he was forced to take lepper back three weeks later to stave off early elections , in the face of poor poll ratings .
the latest crisis erupted in early july , when the premier again sacked lepper over corruption allegations , and samoobrona said it was leaving the coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski and andrzej lepper in happier days lepper denies the charges against him , and has threatened to level unspecified allegations of wrongdoing against the prime minister .
in the current parliament , the pis has 150 seats , tusk 's party 131 and the social democrats have 55 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrzej lepper the pis leadership meeting saturday was expected to make a decision on calling early polls , which kaczynski has more than once brandished as a threat to bring his coalition partners into line .
the two junior parties are uncertain of receiving more than five percent of the vote - the hurdle required for seats in parliament - and are therefore wary of an early ballot .
but such a move would also spell problems for the pis , which according to opinion polls only has some 23 percent support , compared with 33 percent for tusk 's civic platform .
adam lipinski , the deputy pis leader , said friday that he did not envisage a future coalition with tusk 's party , which was narrowly defeated in the 2005 elections .
corruption allegations the existing coalition first fell apart last september when kaczynski fired andrzej lepper , the deputy premier and leader of samoobrona , amid a budget and defence policy dispute .
he was forced to take lepper back three weeks later to stave off early elections , in the face of poor poll ratings .
the latest crisis erupted in early july , when the premier again sacked lepper over corruption allegations , and samoobrona said it was leaving the coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski and andrzej lepper in happier days lepper denies the charges against him , and has threatened to level unspecified allegations of wrongdoing against the prime minister .
in the current parliament , the pis has 150 seats , tusk 's party 131 and the social democrats have 55 .
since coming to power in 2005 , the government under the kaczynski brothers has presided over healthy economic growth , but has had to frequently navigate choppy political waters and has had serious disagreements with its european neighbors . complied from wire service reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the prime minister himself later confirmed that his governing party could no longer govern either with his junior partners , nor without them .
" i see no possibility of supporting a minority government , and we do n't want to have the kind of government we have had recently , " he said at a press conference .
he hinted at the dismissal of two cabinet members , but gave no details .

they 've achieved what few of their colleagues ever will : broken into the english-language book market . in klaus baumgart 's picture book " laura 's star , " the main character laura learns that friends are always there even when you do n't see them .
the book has captivated children around the globe and been made into a movie .
the book 's publisher , frankfurt 's baumhaus-verlag , says it has sold 1.5 million copies , more than half a million in britain and the us alone .
" it 's actually rather rare that a german license sells so well in the english language , " said dawn lacy , who 's responsible for the foreign rights to the baumhaus-verlag 's books .
one of the reasons it 's so seldom is that the english-language book market is especially difficult to break into .
since so many authors write in english there 's little impetus for british or american publishers to look beyond their own countries .

his efforts have even gotten him death threats . philipp plein has become famous in china due to his provocative t-shirt design , but the 29-year-old german is less than completely happy about his fame - maybe notoriety would be a better word . plein said he came up with the idea to print the words " f-u-c-k you china " on t-shirts after being struck and irritated by rampant chinese product piracy .
he wanted to prevent a product-pirate from copying his work . he printed the words " manufactured in europe , produced and designed by philipp plein . " under that was a drawing of a chinese man that might be seen as portraying a negative stereotype or even considered racist by some . he had 100 of those t-shirts made and as of yet , no imitations have hit the market . the " neo-fashion-nazi " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial logo but the idea did n't go over too well in china .
a chinese college student saw the t-shirt in a clothing store in bremen and wrote about it on chinese internet forums . people in china then started collecting signatures against plein , who was promptly nicknamed " neo-fashion-nazi . " it did not take long for an anti-plein web site to be set up . many chinese web sites suggested that their countrymen in germany are seen as second-class citizens .
they inundated the plein 's company with phone calls and e-mails .
many callers simply screamed vulgarities at him before hanging up the phone .
plein and his co-workers even received death threats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this woman 's purse is an original by philipp plein an explanation that the logo actually stood for " the fascinating and urban collection : kiss you china " did not placate the chinese : some proposed the idea of boycotting all german products . the t-shirt affair not only resulted in people 's disgust and some nasty name-calling - a few high-level spats have grown out of it .
chinese diplomats in germany called on plein to recall the t-shirts that were still in stores and destroy them . press conference cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the favorites when it comes to designer piracy : louis vuitton purses and bags plein felt he needed to act , but he cancelled a press conference planned in munich at the end of july .
instead of speaking out personally about the incident and apologizing publicly , plein apologized through a press release . an important photo shooting kept him away , said plein 's spokesperson .
" photographers , models , etc. were already booked , " he said . in the press release , plein said that at no time had he purposely wanted to offend the chinese people .
the logo on his t-shirt was neither a political nor a racist or discriminatory statement , he said . dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the method uses the difference between a body 's surface temperature and the temperature of the surrounding environment .
the system works through thermoelectric generators , which are semiconductors that produce electrical energy from the temperature difference between a hot and cold environment .

on average , the divergence is only a few degrees .
" only low voltages can be produced from differences like these , " said project leader peter spies .
standard thermoelectric generators supply roughly 200 millivolts , so researchers experimented with components to create circuits that can operate on voltages that low .

his efforts have even gotten him death threats . philipp plein has become famous in china due to his provocative t-shirt design , but the 29-year-old german is less than completely happy about his fame - maybe notoriety would be a better word . plein said he came up with the idea to print the words " f-u-c-k you china " on t-shirts after being struck and irritated by rampant chinese product piracy .
he wanted to prevent a product-pirate from copying his work . he printed the words " manufactured in europe , produced and designed by philipp plein .

" it did not take long for an anti-plein web site to be set up . many chinese web sites suggested that their countrymen in germany are seen as second-class citizens .

andrei markovits , an american expert on germany , says politics is just one of the many spheres where europeans oppose the big and powerful united states . andrei markovits is the karl w. deutsch collegiate professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , ann arbor .
he has written several books on germany and recently published " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " dw-world.de : why does europe dislike america ? andrei markovits : it certainly has many historical reasons .
the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .
but , of course , nobody likes a rich uncle . bush and iraq aside , would the relationship be comparable to a family : older siblings being jealous of a baby ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncle sam - still a baby ?
the baby grows up , and becomes the rich uncle .
the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .
this goes on all the time .
it is a general discourse , which i do n't think will disappear anytime soon . louisa schaefer interviewed andrei markovits -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expert : iraq not the only reason for german anti-americanism five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown .
-lrb- 08.08.2007 -rrb- surveys show us image plummeting in germany five years after former german chancellor schröder refused to join the us in its invasion of iraq , surveys show that the continuing bloody conflict there has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .

andrei markovits , an american expert on germany , says politics is just one of the many spheres where europeans oppose the big and powerful united states . andrei markovits is the karl w. deutsch collegiate professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , ann arbor .
he has written several books on germany and recently published " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " dw-world.de : why does europe dislike america ? andrei markovits : it certainly has many historical reasons .
the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .
but , of course , nobody likes a rich uncle . bush and iraq aside , would the relationship be comparable to a family : older siblings being jealous of a baby ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncle sam - still a baby ?
the baby grows up , and becomes the rich uncle .
the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .
this goes on all the time .
it is a general discourse , which i do n't think will disappear anytime soon . louisa schaefer interviewed andrei markovits -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

readers told us about their trips to mad king ludwig 's legendary castle . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have necessarily been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since i worked for walt disney world for over 11 years , neuschwanstein was always an interest to me .
neuschwanstein had given walt the idea for the castle at walt disney world and i was so eager to visit it in person .
i was not disappointed and actually a bit impressed , for it is an imposing site .
it also brought me back to my disney days of employment and i could see why walt was inspired by neuschwanstein . - gregory f. knight , germany while in germany last summer for a two-week vacation , we took a tour of neuschwanstein castle and were totally blown away by the sheer size and beauty of king ludwig 's dream castle .
i loved every aspect of the tour , with the exception of the 90-minute wait , but it was well worth it as the view from the marienbrücke was absolutely amazing .
i do think it would help to have some other activities while you 're waiting for your tour to start , though .
aside from that , we loved our trip to füssen and both castles . - todd knott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king ludwig ii , who built the castle , died a mysterious death in early october 1994 , my family and i spent 12 days in germany .
all of us were excited about seeing neuschwanstein .
we joined a small group for the tour and our guide was a lovely , young woman who spoke excellent english and gave a very detailed explanation of the castle and its history .
she patiently answered every question and mesmerized our son who was 15 at the time , while our daughter -lrb- then 12 -rrb- was fascinated with the furnishings , the decor , and depictions of life in the days of king ludwig ii .
our guide left us pondering the mystery of the king 's demise after telling us some of the intrigues going on at the time .
on the way down , we decided to take the horse-drawn carriage and got more history lessons from the driver and an older german couple riding with us .
the driver told us about hohenschwangau and we could see it perched majestically in the sunlight as we rode past . - gary jacobs , us neuschwanstein should be trying to do something along the lines of warwick castle in england , though warwick castle is a proper castle whilst neuschwanstein is more of a " stately home . " - matt hughes , germany i 've visited a few castles -lrb- including neuschwanstein -rrb- and ruins in germany over the past 35 years and think that the walk up is part of the experience .
why take away from the authenticity with a modern lift ?
the nearby theatre is enough modernism .
in fact , other than seeing my relatives , i love visiting germany as a tourist in part for the old architecture and cobblestone streets , something we are definitely lacking in canada . - mike schmidt , canada as i have been to neuschwanstein and schwangau , i have to say it is really important to enlarge the tourist interest in these shrines of culture .
a museum of the royal family might contribute to a better understanding of all the subjects involved .
the king believed in the role of the arts , believed in architecture and in the active role of man in nature , which for him was creating neuschwanstein .
we can learn a lot from it for our own life . - anna safra , israel back in 1984 i had a chance to visit my birthplace in germany .
to my great pleasure i was able to visit neuschwanstein .
although it was a cold and wet april morning , the sight of neuschwanstein is something i will never forget .
its majestic surroundings have not been fully captured in film and movies .
only in person can it be fully appreciated . - robert gay , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de royal descendants take on tourism at neuschwanstein castle bavaria 's neuschwanstein castle is flooded by tourists , but there 's little to do for visitors once they 've checked out the world-famous building .

they 've achieved what few of their colleagues ever will : broken into the english-language book market . in klaus baumgart 's picture book " laura 's star , " the main character laura learns that friends are always there even when you do n't see them .
the book has captivated children around the globe and been made into a movie .
the book 's publisher , frankfurt 's baumhaus-verlag , says it has sold 1.5 million copies , more than half a million in britain and the us alone .
" it 's actually rather rare that a german license sells so well in the english language , " said dawn lacy , who 's responsible for the foreign rights to the baumhaus-verlag 's books .
one of the reasons it 's so seldom is that the english-language book market is especially difficult to break into .
since so many authors write in english there 's little impetus for british or american publishers to look beyond their own countries .
" unfortunately it 's still the case that most english and american publishers do n't have any german-speaking editors , " renate reichstein of the oetinger publishing house said .
their approach to the language barrier was : " we ca n't do it so we do n't need it , " she added .
success story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke has published more than 40 books but success transcended borders years ago for cornelia funke , the author of the " inkheart " and " dragon rider " children 's books .
equipped with a translation of one of her manuscripts done by a cousin in england , she managed to get her foot in the door , according to reichstein .
her books have been bestsellers well beyond the german-language book market . hollywood has picked up " inkheart " and made a film which will be released in 2008 .
though funke 's success in the anglo-american book market has been one of a few exceptions , it has had positive knock-on effects for writers back home in germany .
publishers outside of germany have recognized that german authors also know how to spin gripping tales that do n't " wag a pedagogical finger " or come across as " typically german , but who just want to awaken a passion to read , " said eva kutter of fischer schatzinsel publishers .
demand grows around twice as many licenses for german-language children and teen literature were sold to foreign countries in 2006 than in 2001 , according to germany 's book trade association .
all told , 2,300 foreign licenses were sold for german-language literature for children and teens last year , far more than for adult fiction .
the increase , however , also reflected the fact that german publishers have been granting more licenses generally .
and those licenses have n't only gone to english-speaking countries .
asian publishers were especially eager to print german children 's and teen literature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " inkheart " movie , with actor brendan fraser , is set to hit screens in april 2008 eastern europe is also growing in importance , reichstein said : " this market has been exciting since the collapse of the soviet union and the associated revival of regional languages that are now rediscovering their own identity and do n't have enough authors .
in this transitional phase they buy up a lot and have it translated . "
publishers agree that there 's no recipe for success .

they 've achieved what few of their colleagues ever will : broken into the english-language book market . in klaus baumgart 's picture book " laura 's star , " the main character laura learns that friends are always there even when you do n't see them .
the book has captivated children around the globe and been made into a movie .
the book 's publisher , frankfurt 's baumhaus-verlag , says it has sold 1.5 million copies , more than half a million in britain and the us alone .
" it 's actually rather rare that a german license sells so well in the english language , " said dawn lacy , who 's responsible for the foreign rights to the baumhaus-verlag 's books .
one of the reasons it 's so seldom is that the english-language book market is especially difficult to break into .
since so many authors write in english there 's little impetus for british or american publishers to look beyond their own countries .
" unfortunately it 's still the case that most english and american publishers do n't have any german-speaking editors , " renate reichstein of the oetinger publishing house said .
their approach to the language barrier was : " we ca n't do it so we do n't need it , " she added .
success story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke has published more than 40 books but success transcended borders years ago for cornelia funke , the author of the " inkheart " and " dragon rider " children 's books .
equipped with a translation of one of her manuscripts done by a cousin in england , she managed to get her foot in the door , according to reichstein .
her books have been bestsellers well beyond the german-language book market . hollywood has picked up " inkheart " and made a film which will be released in 2008 .
though funke 's success in the anglo-american book market has been one of a few exceptions , it has had positive knock-on effects for writers back home in germany .
publishers outside of germany have recognized that german authors also know how to spin gripping tales that do n't " wag a pedagogical finger " or come across as " typically german , but who just want to awaken a passion to read , " said eva kutter of fischer schatzinsel publishers .
demand grows around twice as many licenses for german-language children and teen literature were sold to foreign countries in 2006 than in 2001 , according to germany 's book trade association .
all told , 2,300 foreign licenses were sold for german-language literature for children and teens last year , far more than for adult fiction .
the increase , however , also reflected the fact that german publishers have been granting more licenses generally .
and those licenses have n't only gone to english-speaking countries .
asian publishers were especially eager to print german children 's and teen literature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " inkheart " movie , with actor brendan fraser , is set to hit screens in april 2008 eastern europe is also growing in importance , reichstein said : " this market has been exciting since the collapse of the soviet union and the associated revival of regional languages that are now rediscovering their own identity and do n't have enough authors .
in this transitional phase they buy up a lot and have it translated . "
publishers agree that there 's no recipe for success .
but one formula has triumphed over and over again : strong characters in stories that are told with affection and can be understood the world over - like the tale of laura learning about friendship . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his efforts have even gotten him death threats . philipp plein has become famous in china due to his provocative t-shirt design , but the 29-year-old german is less than completely happy about his fame - maybe notoriety would be a better word . plein said he came up with the idea to print the words " f-u-c-k you china " on t-shirts after being struck and irritated by rampant chinese product piracy .
he wanted to prevent a product-pirate from copying his work . he printed the words " manufactured in europe , produced and designed by philipp plein . " under that was a drawing of a chinese man that might be seen as portraying a negative stereotype or even considered racist by some . he had 100 of those t-shirts made and as of yet , no imitations have hit the market . the " neo-fashion-nazi " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial logo but the idea did n't go over too well in china .
a chinese college student saw the t-shirt in a clothing store in bremen and wrote about it on chinese internet forums . people in china then started collecting signatures against plein , who was promptly nicknamed " neo-fashion-nazi . " it did not take long for an anti-plein web site to be set up . many chinese web sites suggested that their countrymen in germany are seen as second-class citizens .
they inundated the plein 's company with phone calls and e-mails .
many callers simply screamed vulgarities at him before hanging up the phone .
plein and his co-workers even received death threats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this woman 's purse is an original by philipp plein an explanation that the logo actually stood for " the fascinating and urban collection : kiss you china " did not placate the chinese : some proposed the idea of boycotting all german products . the t-shirt affair not only resulted in people 's disgust and some nasty name-calling - a few high-level spats have grown out of it .
chinese diplomats in germany called on plein to recall the t-shirts that were still in stores and destroy them . press conference cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the favorites when it comes to designer piracy : louis vuitton purses and bags plein felt he needed to act , but he cancelled a press conference planned in munich at the end of july .
instead of speaking out personally about the incident and apologizing publicly , plein apologized through a press release . an important photo shooting kept him away , said plein 's spokesperson .
" photographers , models , etc. were already booked , " he said . in the press release , plein said that at no time had he purposely wanted to offend the chinese people .
the logo on his t-shirt was neither a political nor a racist or discriminatory statement , he said . dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the prime minister himself later confirmed that his governing party could no longer govern either with his junior partners , nor without them .
" i see no possibility of supporting a minority government , and we do n't want to have the kind of government we have had recently , " he said at a press conference .
he hinted at the dismissal of two cabinet members , but gave no details .
the eu 's biggest former communist country has been in political turmoil for months and speculation has been rife that kaczynski would end up calling for elections to be held two years early .
speaking after earlier talks with kaczynski , the head of the radical league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , roman giertych , had told journalists on saturday that " the prime minister told me that he was breaking the coalition with the lpr and that lpr ministers would be dismissed on monday . "
the ministers of the populist sambroona party , which has already announced it is quitting the government , would also be fired , giertych added .
" mounting chaos " bitter infighting has sparked a political crisis within the coalition headed by kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
the prime minister 's twin brother , president lech kaczynski , and opposition leader donald tusk agreed on thursday that it was " inevitable " that elections scheduled for 2009 would have to be brought forward , most probably to october .
it was time to end the " mounting chaos , " tusk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrzej lepper the pis leadership meeting saturday was expected to make a decision on calling early polls , which kaczynski has more than once brandished as a threat to bring his coalition partners into line .
the two junior parties are uncertain of receiving more than five percent of the vote - the hurdle required for seats in parliament - and are therefore wary of an early ballot .
but such a move would also spell problems for the pis , which according to opinion polls only has some 23 percent support , compared with 33 percent for tusk 's civic platform .
adam lipinski , the deputy pis leader , said friday that he did not envisage a future coalition with tusk 's party , which was narrowly defeated in the 2005 elections .
corruption allegations the existing coalition first fell apart last september when kaczynski fired andrzej lepper , the deputy premier and leader of samoobrona , amid a budget and defence policy dispute .
he was forced to take lepper back three weeks later to stave off early elections , in the face of poor poll ratings .
the latest crisis erupted in early july , when the premier again sacked lepper over corruption allegations , and samoobrona said it was leaving the coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski and andrzej lepper in happier days lepper denies the charges against him , and has threatened to level unspecified allegations of wrongdoing against the prime minister .
in the current parliament , the pis has 150 seats , tusk 's party 131 and the social democrats have 55 .

the prime minister himself later confirmed that his governing party could no longer govern either with his junior partners , nor without them .
" i see no possibility of supporting a minority government , and we do n't want to have the kind of government we have had recently , " he said at a press conference .
he hinted at the dismissal of two cabinet members , but gave no details .
the eu 's biggest former communist country has been in political turmoil for months and speculation has been rife that kaczynski would end up calling for elections to be held two years early .
speaking after earlier talks with kaczynski , the head of the radical league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , roman giertych , had told journalists on saturday that " the prime minister told me that he was breaking the coalition with the lpr and that lpr ministers would be dismissed on monday . "
the ministers of the populist sambroona party , which has already announced it is quitting the government , would also be fired , giertych added .
" mounting chaos " bitter infighting has sparked a political crisis within the coalition headed by kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
the prime minister 's twin brother , president lech kaczynski , and opposition leader donald tusk agreed on thursday that it was " inevitable " that elections scheduled for 2009 would have to be brought forward , most probably to october .
it was time to end the " mounting chaos , " tusk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrzej lepper the pis leadership meeting saturday was expected to make a decision on calling early polls , which kaczynski has more than once brandished as a threat to bring his coalition partners into line .
the two junior parties are uncertain of receiving more than five percent of the vote - the hurdle required for seats in parliament - and are therefore wary of an early ballot .
but such a move would also spell problems for the pis , which according to opinion polls only has some 23 percent support , compared with 33 percent for tusk 's civic platform .
adam lipinski , the deputy pis leader , said friday that he did not envisage a future coalition with tusk 's party , which was narrowly defeated in the 2005 elections .
corruption allegations the existing coalition first fell apart last september when kaczynski fired andrzej lepper , the deputy premier and leader of samoobrona , amid a budget and defence policy dispute .
he was forced to take lepper back three weeks later to stave off early elections , in the face of poor poll ratings .
the latest crisis erupted in early july , when the premier again sacked lepper over corruption allegations , and samoobrona said it was leaving the coalition .

andrei markovits , an american expert on germany , says politics is just one of the many spheres where europeans oppose the big and powerful united states . andrei markovits is the karl w. deutsch collegiate professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , ann arbor .
he has written several books on germany and recently published " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " dw-world.de : why does europe dislike america ? andrei markovits : it certainly has many historical reasons .
the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .

the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .

andrei markovits , an american expert on germany , says politics is just one of the many spheres where europeans oppose the big and powerful united states . andrei markovits is the karl w. deutsch collegiate professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , ann arbor .
he has written several books on germany and recently published " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " dw-world.de : why does europe dislike america ? andrei markovits : it certainly has many historical reasons .
the bush administration 's policies have driven it into overdrive but all the constituent parts have been there since , at the latest , july of 1776 .
european elites hated america from the get go , because it was republican .
it then became powerful , and it obviously intervened in europe throughout the 20th century , which is to many europeans a benefit .
but , of course , nobody likes a rich uncle . bush and iraq aside , would the relationship be comparable to a family : older siblings being jealous of a baby ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncle sam - still a baby ?
the baby grows up , and becomes the rich uncle .
the baby is now the one that cleans up the big mess in the family in the 20th century .
it is a dominating and exacting baby .
babies are only loved , but babies that become big men are certainly not just loved .
america represents modernity from the 19th century on .
anyone who fears modernity associates it with america .
it is ruthlessness .
for europeans , it is uncultured , flimsy , fleeting , quick . what is it that germans dislike about the us ? pretty much everything .
americans are puritanical and , of course , also oversexed - it is what i call the bikini problem .
if you wear a bikini in northern europe you are obviously prude , because everyone in northern europe goes topless , but if you wear a bikini in conservative areas you are oversexed .
what is interesting about anti-americanism is that whatever you do and its opposite is what is disliked .
it is a duality , a clearly unilateralist , but in many cases multilateralist , which is also hated .
let 's not forget that it was the german chancellor -lsb- helmut -rsb- schmidt , who lectured jimmy carter how the us should behave like a real leader , not a church guy , who is into human rights .
i can not think of any area where there is not some resentment about the united states in any german discourse : university reforms , even sports .
you can go to a german soccer game and you see signs that schalke is against americanization .
if there is an area in which the us had zero influence on the world , trust me , that is the world of soccer .
and even there the word americanization completely permeates the discourse . there is this view that the us saved germany in the second world war .
do you think some of the anti-americanism stems from the fact that the us did win the war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans soon stopped waving us flags after liberation absolutely !
here they were , they saved germany , they introduced democracy , too .
of course then the germans grew and became superb at it to their great credit .
the very fact that the americans , ultimately , not only imposed democracy , but also imposed a successful democracy , helped west germans win the cold war .
suddenly the baby has become the big guy who is really helping .
the thing that you place our finger on is a particularly german dimension of resentment that comes as a form of immaturity , and no one likes to be immature .
germans detested americans , although of course they detested them less than they detested the russians .
this helped tremendously in the legitimation of the federal republic and the american presence .
after all , if you are occupied , why not be occupied with people that bring you chocolate and nylons . is it simply envy ? envy is too simple .
i do n't think by now europeans envy america .
envy is something very clear , and you can overcome that .
this is much deeper . why should n't germans envy the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the american president is not exactly welcome in europe because of health insurance , public goods , better streets , and on and on .
for example , if you 're a citizen of hamburg versus your normal guy in chicago , then chances are that your life actually in hamburg is better .
your normal hamburg guy today resents the united states , but does not envy it .
envy might have been an issue right after the war .
envy is a very clear emotion which is very open , to which people admit .
looking at surveys , very few people really admit how the us is disliked .
if you ask them point blank : are you anti-america ?
they will say , ' oh no , i am just anti-bush . ' what do you see happening in the rest of europe in terms of improving relations with the us ? in germany , improving relations already happened after the schröder administration .
things are , no question , better , and hopefully , with a democratic president in 2008 , things will get better on that level , as well .
this will , however , not eliminate the underlying resentment and anger .
but do n't forget that europe has now become functional .
europe is now a big boy himself , and europe has interests .
europe would be a fool not to use global resentment against the united states to its own advantage .
and it does .
if i 'm a european businessman , and hustling against an american company , i would be a complete idiot if i would not harness the resentment towards america that has in fact become a global lingua franca .
this is always much stronger on the elite level than people level .
it is very interesting that across the board in europe , anti-americanism has always been stronger among the elites , the chattering classes .
basically , anti-americanism is one of the last completely accepted and indeed lauded prejudices in cotemporary polite society . why is that ?
prejudices are usually more common among less educated people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a common sight throughtout the world in this case , it is a resentment of superiority : we -lsb- europeans -rsb- might not have the power , but they -lsb- americans -rsb- are the newcomers to the world history .
but we -lsb- europeans -rsb- have the refined things in life , and that is less important to less refined people .
also do n't forget that america by its very nature was a populist country which in fact rejected the old , european aristocratic order , so that from the get go , european aristocracy , and hence the elites , always disdained it .
it is in fact , the only prejudice you can voice openly .
no one thinks for a second to just go on about the americans as being fat , ignorant , stupid , uncultured , etc .
the reason is because you are in fact allowed to voice prejudices and distain towards a mr. big .
i think it is very good that you ca n't say this against the weak .
it is a wonderful advance since the late 1960s , that you can not go on and on about blacks , or women , or handicapped , but you can do it towards the dominant culture , which , in this case , are the white males , which is america . does this make it ok to have prejudices against the us as a whole , since it is the dominant society ? no , it does not make it okay . how can it be changed ? it ca n't be changed .
it might become better with the end of the iraq war , and hillary -lsb- clinton -rsb- as a president , but it wo n't disappear .
today , it is hard for young american students to be in germany - they constantly have to explain themselves .
you basically have to start every conversation with " i hate bush . "
for you to be seen as a half-way decent human being , that is the opening gambit .
americans need to constantly prove that they are the good , different american .
this goes on all the time .
it is a general discourse , which i do n't think will disappear anytime soon . louisa schaefer interviewed andrei markovits -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have necessarily been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since i worked for walt disney world for over 11 years , neuschwanstein was always an interest to me .
neuschwanstein had given walt the idea for the castle at walt disney world and i was so eager to visit it in person .
i was not disappointed and actually a bit impressed , for it is an imposing site .
it also brought me back to my disney days of employment and i could see why walt was inspired by neuschwanstein . - gregory f. knight , germany while in germany last summer for a two-week vacation , we took a tour of neuschwanstein castle and were totally blown away by the sheer size and beauty of king ludwig 's dream castle .
i loved every aspect of the tour , with the exception of the 90-minute wait , but it was well worth it as the view from the marienbrücke was absolutely amazing .
i do think it would help to have some other activities while you 're waiting for your tour to start , though .
aside from that , we loved our trip to füssen and both castles . - todd knott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king ludwig ii , who built the castle , died a mysterious death in early october 1994 , my family and i spent 12 days in germany .
all of us were excited about seeing neuschwanstein .
we joined a small group for the tour and our guide was a lovely , young woman who spoke excellent english and gave a very detailed explanation of the castle and its history .
she patiently answered every question and mesmerized our son who was 15 at the time , while our daughter -lrb- then 12 -rrb- was fascinated with the furnishings , the decor , and depictions of life in the days of king ludwig ii .
our guide left us pondering the mystery of the king 's demise after telling us some of the intrigues going on at the time .
on the way down , we decided to take the horse-drawn carriage and got more history lessons from the driver and an older german couple riding with us .
the driver told us about hohenschwangau and we could see it perched majestically in the sunlight as we rode past . - gary jacobs , us neuschwanstein should be trying to do something along the lines of warwick castle in england , though warwick castle is a proper castle whilst neuschwanstein is more of a " stately home . " - matt hughes , germany i 've visited a few castles -lrb- including neuschwanstein -rrb- and ruins in germany over the past 35 years and think that the walk up is part of the experience .
why take away from the authenticity with a modern lift ?
the nearby theatre is enough modernism .
in fact , other than seeing my relatives , i love visiting germany as a tourist in part for the old architecture and cobblestone streets , something we are definitely lacking in canada . - mike schmidt , canada as i have been to neuschwanstein and schwangau , i have to say it is really important to enlarge the tourist interest in these shrines of culture .
a museum of the royal family might contribute to a better understanding of all the subjects involved .
the king believed in the role of the arts , believed in architecture and in the active role of man in nature , which for him was creating neuschwanstein .

readers told us about their trips to mad king ludwig 's legendary castle . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have necessarily been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since i worked for walt disney world for over 11 years , neuschwanstein was always an interest to me .
neuschwanstein had given walt the idea for the castle at walt disney world and i was so eager to visit it in person .
i was not disappointed and actually a bit impressed , for it is an imposing site .
it also brought me back to my disney days of employment and i could see why walt was inspired by neuschwanstein . - gregory f. knight , germany while in germany last summer for a two-week vacation , we took a tour of neuschwanstein castle and were totally blown away by the sheer size and beauty of king ludwig 's dream castle .
i loved every aspect of the tour , with the exception of the 90-minute wait , but it was well worth it as the view from the marienbrücke was absolutely amazing .
i do think it would help to have some other activities while you 're waiting for your tour to start , though .
aside from that , we loved our trip to füssen and both castles . - todd knott , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king ludwig ii , who built the castle , died a mysterious death in early october 1994 , my family and i spent 12 days in germany .
all of us were excited about seeing neuschwanstein .
we joined a small group for the tour and our guide was a lovely , young woman who spoke excellent english and gave a very detailed explanation of the castle and its history .
she patiently answered every question and mesmerized our son who was 15 at the time , while our daughter -lrb- then 12 -rrb- was fascinated with the furnishings , the decor , and depictions of life in the days of king ludwig ii .
our guide left us pondering the mystery of the king 's demise after telling us some of the intrigues going on at the time .
on the way down , we decided to take the horse-drawn carriage and got more history lessons from the driver and an older german couple riding with us .
the driver told us about hohenschwangau and we could see it perched majestically in the sunlight as we rode past . - gary jacobs , us neuschwanstein should be trying to do something along the lines of warwick castle in england , though warwick castle is a proper castle whilst neuschwanstein is more of a " stately home . " - matt hughes , germany i 've visited a few castles -lrb- including neuschwanstein -rrb- and ruins in germany over the past 35 years and think that the walk up is part of the experience .
why take away from the authenticity with a modern lift ?
the nearby theatre is enough modernism .
in fact , other than seeing my relatives , i love visiting germany as a tourist in part for the old architecture and cobblestone streets , something we are definitely lacking in canada . - mike schmidt , canada as i have been to neuschwanstein and schwangau , i have to say it is really important to enlarge the tourist interest in these shrines of culture .
a museum of the royal family might contribute to a better understanding of all the subjects involved .
the king believed in the role of the arts , believed in architecture and in the active role of man in nature , which for him was creating neuschwanstein .
we can learn a lot from it for our own life . - anna safra , israel back in 1984 i had a chance to visit my birthplace in germany .
to my great pleasure i was able to visit neuschwanstein .
although it was a cold and wet april morning , the sight of neuschwanstein is something i will never forget .

the method uses the difference between a body 's surface temperature and the temperature of the surrounding environment .
the system works through thermoelectric generators , which are semiconductors that produce electrical energy from the temperature difference between a hot and cold environment .

on average , the divergence is only a few degrees .
" only low voltages can be produced from differences like these , " said project leader peter spies .
standard thermoelectric generators supply roughly 200 millivolts , so researchers experimented with components to create circuits that can operate on voltages that low .

they 've achieved what few of their colleagues ever will : broken into the english-language book market . in klaus baumgart 's picture book " laura 's star , " the main character laura learns that friends are always there even when you do n't see them .
the book has captivated children around the globe and been made into a movie .
the book 's publisher , frankfurt 's baumhaus-verlag , says it has sold 1.5 million copies , more than half a million in britain and the us alone .
" it 's actually rather rare that a german license sells so well in the english language , " said dawn lacy , who 's responsible for the foreign rights to the baumhaus-verlag 's books .
one of the reasons it 's so seldom is that the english-language book market is especially difficult to break into .
since so many authors write in english there 's little impetus for british or american publishers to look beyond their own countries .
" unfortunately it 's still the case that most english and american publishers do n't have any german-speaking editors , " renate reichstein of the oetinger publishing house said .
their approach to the language barrier was : " we ca n't do it so we do n't need it , " she added .
success story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke has published more than 40 books but success transcended borders years ago for cornelia funke , the author of the " inkheart " and " dragon rider " children 's books .
equipped with a translation of one of her manuscripts done by a cousin in england , she managed to get her foot in the door , according to reichstein .
her books have been bestsellers well beyond the german-language book market . hollywood has picked up " inkheart " and made a film which will be released in 2008 .
though funke 's success in the anglo-american book market has been one of a few exceptions , it has had positive knock-on effects for writers back home in germany .
publishers outside of germany have recognized that german authors also know how to spin gripping tales that do n't " wag a pedagogical finger " or come across as " typically german , but who just want to awaken a passion to read , " said eva kutter of fischer schatzinsel publishers .
demand grows around twice as many licenses for german-language children and teen literature were sold to foreign countries in 2006 than in 2001 , according to germany 's book trade association .
all told , 2,300 foreign licenses were sold for german-language literature for children and teens last year , far more than for adult fiction .
the increase , however , also reflected the fact that german publishers have been granting more licenses generally .
and those licenses have n't only gone to english-speaking countries .
asian publishers were especially eager to print german children 's and teen literature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " inkheart " movie , with actor brendan fraser , is set to hit screens in april 2008 eastern europe is also growing in importance , reichstein said : " this market has been exciting since the collapse of the soviet union and the associated revival of regional languages that are now rediscovering their own identity and do n't have enough authors .
in this transitional phase they buy up a lot and have it translated . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 11.08.2007 polish prime minister to break up coalition , push for early poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservative kaczynski brothers are watching their coalition crumble poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski said saturday his governing law and justice party will push for early elections to end the strife within his struggling coalition . poland 's conservative prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski is to sack the ministers of his two junior coalition partners , the leader of one of them said saturday , making early snap general elections more likely .
the prime minister himself later confirmed that his governing party could no longer govern either with his junior partners , nor without them .
" i see no possibility of supporting a minority government , and we do n't want to have the kind of government we have had recently , " he said at a press conference .
he hinted at the dismissal of two cabinet members , but gave no details .
the eu 's biggest former communist country has been in political turmoil for months and speculation has been rife that kaczynski would end up calling for elections to be held two years early .
speaking after earlier talks with kaczynski , the head of the radical league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , roman giertych , had told journalists on saturday that " the prime minister told me that he was breaking the coalition with the lpr and that lpr ministers would be dismissed on monday . "
the ministers of the populist sambroona party , which has already announced it is quitting the government , would also be fired , giertych added .
" mounting chaos " bitter infighting has sparked a political crisis within the coalition headed by kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
the prime minister 's twin brother , president lech kaczynski , and opposition leader donald tusk agreed on thursday that it was " inevitable " that elections scheduled for 2009 would have to be brought forward , most probably to october .
it was time to end the " mounting chaos , " tusk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrzej lepper the pis leadership meeting saturday was expected to make a decision on calling early polls , which kaczynski has more than once brandished as a threat to bring his coalition partners into line .
the two junior parties are uncertain of receiving more than five percent of the vote - the hurdle required for seats in parliament - and are therefore wary of an early ballot .
but such a move would also spell problems for the pis , which according to opinion polls only has some 23 percent support , compared with 33 percent for tusk 's civic platform .
adam lipinski , the deputy pis leader , said friday that he did not envisage a future coalition with tusk 's party , which was narrowly defeated in the 2005 elections .
corruption allegations the existing coalition first fell apart last september when kaczynski fired andrzej lepper , the deputy premier and leader of samoobrona , amid a budget and defence policy dispute .
he was forced to take lepper back three weeks later to stave off early elections , in the face of poor poll ratings .
the latest crisis erupted in early july , when the premier again sacked lepper over corruption allegations , and samoobrona said it was leaving the coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski and andrzej lepper in happier days lepper denies the charges against him , and has threatened to level unspecified allegations of wrongdoing against the prime minister .
in the current parliament , the pis has 150 seats , tusk 's party 131 and the social democrats have 55 .

the prime minister himself later confirmed that his governing party could no longer govern either with his junior partners , nor without them .
" i see no possibility of supporting a minority government , and we do n't want to have the kind of government we have had recently , " he said at a press conference .
he hinted at the dismissal of two cabinet members , but gave no details .
the eu 's biggest former communist country has been in political turmoil for months and speculation has been rife that kaczynski would end up calling for elections to be held two years early .
speaking after earlier talks with kaczynski , the head of the radical league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , roman giertych , had told journalists on saturday that " the prime minister told me that he was breaking the coalition with the lpr and that lpr ministers would be dismissed on monday . "
the ministers of the populist sambroona party , which has already announced it is quitting the government , would also be fired , giertych added .
" mounting chaos " bitter infighting has sparked a political crisis within the coalition headed by kaczynski 's law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party .
the prime minister 's twin brother , president lech kaczynski , and opposition leader donald tusk agreed on thursday that it was " inevitable " that elections scheduled for 2009 would have to be brought forward , most probably to october .
it was time to end the " mounting chaos , " tusk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrzej lepper the pis leadership meeting saturday was expected to make a decision on calling early polls , which kaczynski has more than once brandished as a threat to bring his coalition partners into line .
the two junior parties are uncertain of receiving more than five percent of the vote - the hurdle required for seats in parliament - and are therefore wary of an early ballot .
but such a move would also spell problems for the pis , which according to opinion polls only has some 23 percent support , compared with 33 percent for tusk 's civic platform .
adam lipinski , the deputy pis leader , said friday that he did not envisage a future coalition with tusk 's party , which was narrowly defeated in the 2005 elections .
corruption allegations the existing coalition first fell apart last september when kaczynski fired andrzej lepper , the deputy premier and leader of samoobrona , amid a budget and defence policy dispute .
he was forced to take lepper back three weeks later to stave off early elections , in the face of poor poll ratings .
the latest crisis erupted in early july , when the premier again sacked lepper over corruption allegations , and samoobrona said it was leaving the coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski and andrzej lepper in happier days lepper denies the charges against him , and has threatened to level unspecified allegations of wrongdoing against the prime minister .
in the current parliament , the pis has 150 seats , tusk 's party 131 and the social democrats have 55 .

the prime minister 's twin brother , president lech kaczynski , and opposition leader donald tusk agreed on thursday that it was " inevitable " that elections scheduled for 2009 would have to be brought forward , most probably to october .
it was time to end the " mounting chaos , " tusk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrzej lepper the pis leadership meeting saturday was expected to make a decision on calling early polls , which kaczynski has more than once brandished as a threat to bring his coalition partners into line .
the two junior parties are uncertain of receiving more than five percent of the vote - the hurdle required for seats in parliament - and are therefore wary of an early ballot .
but such a move would also spell problems for the pis , which according to opinion polls only has some 23 percent support , compared with 33 percent for tusk 's civic platform .
adam lipinski , the deputy pis leader , said friday that he did not envisage a future coalition with tusk 's party , which was narrowly defeated in the 2005 elections .
corruption allegations the existing coalition first fell apart last september when kaczynski fired andrzej lepper , the deputy premier and leader of samoobrona , amid a budget and defence policy dispute .
he was forced to take lepper back three weeks later to stave off early elections , in the face of poor poll ratings .
the latest crisis erupted in early july , when the premier again sacked lepper over corruption allegations , and samoobrona said it was leaving the coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski and andrzej lepper in happier days lepper denies the charges against him , and has threatened to level unspecified allegations of wrongdoing against the prime minister .
in the current parliament , the pis has 150 seats , tusk 's party 131 and the social democrats have 55 .
since coming to power in 2005 , the government under the kaczynski brothers has presided over healthy economic growth , but has had to frequently navigate choppy political waters and has had serious disagreements with its european neighbors . complied from wire service reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the prime minister himself later confirmed that his governing party could no longer govern either with his junior partners , nor without them .
" i see no possibility of supporting a minority government , and we do n't want to have the kind of government we have had recently , " he said at a press conference .
he hinted at the dismissal of two cabinet members , but gave no details .
the eu 's biggest former communist country has been in political turmoil for months and speculation has been rife that kaczynski would end up calling for elections to be held two years early .
speaking after earlier talks with kaczynski , the head of the radical league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , roman giertych , had told journalists on saturday that " the prime minister told me that he was breaking the coalition with the lpr and that lpr ministers would be dismissed on monday . "
the ministers of the populist sambroona party , which has already announced it is quitting the government , would also be fired , giertych added .

they 've achieved what few of their colleagues ever will : broken into the english-language book market . in klaus baumgart 's picture book " laura 's star , " the main character laura learns that friends are always there even when you do n't see them .
the book has captivated children around the globe and been made into a movie .
the book 's publisher , frankfurt 's baumhaus-verlag , says it has sold 1.5 million copies , more than half a million in britain and the us alone .
" it 's actually rather rare that a german license sells so well in the english language , " said dawn lacy , who 's responsible for the foreign rights to the baumhaus-verlag 's books .
one of the reasons it 's so seldom is that the english-language book market is especially difficult to break into .
since so many authors write in english there 's little impetus for british or american publishers to look beyond their own countries .
" unfortunately it 's still the case that most english and american publishers do n't have any german-speaking editors , " renate reichstein of the oetinger publishing house said .
their approach to the language barrier was : " we ca n't do it so we do n't need it , " she added .
success story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke has published more than 40 books but success transcended borders years ago for cornelia funke , the author of the " inkheart " and " dragon rider " children 's books .
equipped with a translation of one of her manuscripts done by a cousin in england , she managed to get her foot in the door , according to reichstein .
her books have been bestsellers well beyond the german-language book market . hollywood has picked up " inkheart " and made a film which will be released in 2008 .
though funke 's success in the anglo-american book market has been one of a few exceptions , it has had positive knock-on effects for writers back home in germany .
publishers outside of germany have recognized that german authors also know how to spin gripping tales that do n't " wag a pedagogical finger " or come across as " typically german , but who just want to awaken a passion to read , " said eva kutter of fischer schatzinsel publishers .
demand grows around twice as many licenses for german-language children and teen literature were sold to foreign countries in 2006 than in 2001 , according to germany 's book trade association .
all told , 2,300 foreign licenses were sold for german-language literature for children and teens last year , far more than for adult fiction .
the increase , however , also reflected the fact that german publishers have been granting more licenses generally .
and those licenses have n't only gone to english-speaking countries .
asian publishers were especially eager to print german children 's and teen literature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " inkheart " movie , with actor brendan fraser , is set to hit screens in april 2008 eastern europe is also growing in importance , reichstein said : " this market has been exciting since the collapse of the soviet union and the associated revival of regional languages that are now rediscovering their own identity and do n't have enough authors .
in this transitional phase they buy up a lot and have it translated . "
publishers agree that there 's no recipe for success .

his efforts have even gotten him death threats . philipp plein has become famous in china due to his provocative t-shirt design , but the 29-year-old german is less than completely happy about his fame - maybe notoriety would be a better word . plein said he came up with the idea to print the words " f-u-c-k you china " on t-shirts after being struck and irritated by rampant chinese product piracy .
he wanted to prevent a product-pirate from copying his work . he printed the words " manufactured in europe , produced and designed by philipp plein . " under that was a drawing of a chinese man that might be seen as portraying a negative stereotype or even considered racist by some . he had 100 of those t-shirts made and as of yet , no imitations have hit the market . the " neo-fashion-nazi " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial logo but the idea did n't go over too well in china .
a chinese college student saw the t-shirt in a clothing store in bremen and wrote about it on chinese internet forums . people in china then started collecting signatures against plein , who was promptly nicknamed " neo-fashion-nazi . " it did not take long for an anti-plein web site to be set up . many chinese web sites suggested that their countrymen in germany are seen as second-class citizens .
they inundated the plein 's company with phone calls and e-mails .
many callers simply screamed vulgarities at him before hanging up the phone .
plein and his co-workers even received death threats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this woman 's purse is an original by philipp plein an explanation that the logo actually stood for " the fascinating and urban collection : kiss you china " did not placate the chinese : some proposed the idea of boycotting all german products . the t-shirt affair not only resulted in people 's disgust and some nasty name-calling - a few high-level spats have grown out of it .
chinese diplomats in germany called on plein to recall the t-shirts that were still in stores and destroy them . press conference cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the favorites when it comes to designer piracy : louis vuitton purses and bags plein felt he needed to act , but he cancelled a press conference planned in munich at the end of july .
instead of speaking out personally about the incident and apologizing publicly , plein apologized through a press release . an important photo shooting kept him away , said plein 's spokesperson .
" photographers , models , etc. were already booked , " he said . in the press release , plein said that at no time had he purposely wanted to offend the chinese people .
the logo on his t-shirt was neither a political nor a racist or discriminatory statement , he said . dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bbc correspondent niki cardwell says the problem is partly cultural with eastern european immigrants - for whom carp is a delicacy - taking fish from lakes .
they do not realise that it is unacceptable to eat the fish they catch , she says , adding that poachers have been seen patrolling lakes .
mr salter says the problem is getting worse but that the legal framework is simply not strong enough to cope with the problem .
" for example , in the thames region it is legal , even though it 's not in our culture , it is legal to take two fish of any size , " he said .
" in some other regions you can take as many fish as you like , but there are certain size limits .
and these things are simply not enforced . "
floods one lake in northampton has been forced to close because the problem has become so bad .
and the nafc warns others could suffer the same fate .
the organisation 's representative for the anglian region , steve hellen , said fish were normally fairly comfortable within their own environment .
" but if you introduce extreme elements into that environment , such as we had with very high water levels , fish can become displaced from the normal area within a river , for instance , that they live in .
" and because of man made structures such as weirs and sluices and things those fish may never be able to return to their normal resident area . "
freshwater fish in the uk have been hit by the extreme and prolonged heat of 2006 followed by floods in 2007 .

the canal 's fourth bridge will be jacked up and lowered into place between two steel side buttresses .
spanish architect santiago calatrava designed the structure which has attracted controversy over how it will affect the italian city 's landscape .
parts of the 55-metre bridge were transported down the canal , past the rialto bridge , earlier this week .
this project will link the city 's train station with the piazzale roma , a car and bus terminal on the other side of the canal .
officials believe the bridge is necessary because of the increasing number of activities which will be held in roma square .

tests on the bridge 's foundation structures have also been completed .
mr calatrava , who designed the athens olympics sport complex and the palace of the arts in valencia , won the bid to build the bridge in 1999 .
