a superb third goal came in the final seconds when brazilian midfielder diego belted the ball out of his own half into an empty net after goalkeeper kristian nicht had come upfield for a free-kick .
the win takes thomas schaaf 's side onto 60 points with four matches remaining , one point ahead of schalke 04 who will go back to the top if they beat energie cottbus at home on saturday .
" aachen played well and were always looking to get forward but we had a series of chances and i have to praise my team for the way they kept going over 90 minutes , " said schaaf .
bremen clinched the points thanks to inspired half-time substitutions by schaaf and lead the table for the first time since late january .
aachen 's fourth successive defeat danish midfielder jensen , on for frank baumann , raced through the middle to take a pass by miroslav klose at the end of a fine bremen move to score the home side 's first in the 50th minute .
five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenberg , pasanen and owomoyela celebrate diego 's goal further chances went begging with diego screwing a shot wide and klose striking the post , and bremen almost paid the price when jan schlaudraff found himself with a chance , only for wiese to block .
aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .
it was a fourth successive defeat for aachen who remain deep in relegation danger just outside the immediate drop zone .
" we started well enough and created counter attacking opportunities but never really finished the moves off , " said aachen coach michael frontzeck .
" bremen then put us under a lot of pressure and in the end the goals had to come and they deserved their victory . "
good start not good enough the evening had begun well for the visitors who caught bremen cold in the second minute when pinto forced the ball over the line with the help of goalkeeper tim wiese .
the move had started with aachen 's pinto and marius ebbers escaping the offside trap .
ebbers raced down the right and his cross was met by pinto who kneed the ball towards goal at close range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pinto scored for aachen 's 1-0 lead the ball was blocked by wiese but came straight back as bremen midfielder torsten frings also tried to clear , but the prostrate pinto got his foot to the ball and wiese could only parry the midfielder 's second effort behind him and over the line .

stuttgart , who on wednesday reached the german cup final , are on 55 points , two points ahead of fourth-placed bayern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 21.04.2007 soccer world cup hardly touched german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most tangible economic outcome of the world cup was its marketing value the patriotism and high spirits unleashed by this past summer 's world cup were expected to boost the german economy , but experts say the soccer event had virtually no impact on growth and employment . the world cup soccer fever which swept germany last summer had no meaningful effect for the overall economy , according to a report released this week by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . although consumer spending increased in the second half of last year , this was due mainly to the increase of the value-added tax on goods and services from 16 to 19 percent , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2006 . the authors of the report , karl brenke and gert wagner , who conducted a statistical analysis , said that the expectation the world cup would significantly increase spending , were overly exaggerated . " the world cup 's contribution to economic growth has been negligible .
it was great fun .
nothing more , nothing less , " said wagner , the institute 's research director of social risk management . problem filtering out single economic impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer consumption went up during the cup , despite a declining trend separating out the economic effects of a mega sports events from other business trends is problematic , said sports economist markus kurscheidt of the university of bochum . " one has to be able to statistically filter other variables to determine the sole effect of the world cup , " said kurscheidt . only one thing remains clear : from 2002 to 2005 , the infrastructure and promotion costs in hosting the big event boosted overall economic performance by barely 0.2 percent or at most 0.7 percent . not surprisingly , the main beneficiaries of the world cup largesse was fifa , the international soccer federation , and the german soccer association dfb , which cashed in 187 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- and 21 million euros respectively .
the restaurant industry , where bars and outdoor cafes broadcast the live games , profited handsomely , although the sunny skies also boosted public viewing on huge projection screens . boost for beer consumption and hotel bookings the world cup no doubt helped push up beer consumption in germany . overall , germans consumed a total of 92 million hectolitres -lrb- 2.43 billion gallons -rrb- of beer , which was 0.5 million more than in 2005 , according to the federal statistics office .
it was the first annual increase since 1999 following a declining trend in imbibing the golden ale . domestic and foreign tourists coming for the games also spent 500 million euros on goods and services , and temporarily boosted occupancy rates in hotels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish weather and brazilian high spirits did n't translate into a big rainmaker but the amount still fell far short of expectations .
germany 's postbank , one the world cup 's national sponsors , predicted a boost of up to 10 billion euros for the economy and 10,000 more long-term jobs created . wagner suggested that any positive financial outcome is tainted by perception .
" whoever expected to make profits would naturally want to attribute overall growth to the effects of the world cup , " said wagner . sports economist kurscheidt was even more critical in his analysis .
" before the 2002 soccer games in japan and south korea , big profit figures were floated around .
the world cup was supposed to overhaul the economies of whole countries , " he said . a month of partying both the diw and kurscheidt already had low expectations before the 2006 summer games even took off .
" the direct impetus could not have been so huge .
one month of partying ca n't be a rainmaker for the entire year .

a superb third goal came in the final seconds when brazilian midfielder diego belted the ball out of his own half into an empty net after goalkeeper kristian nicht had come upfield for a free-kick .
the win takes thomas schaaf 's side onto 60 points with four matches remaining , one point ahead of schalke 04 who will go back to the top if they beat energie cottbus at home on saturday .
" aachen played well and were always looking to get forward but we had a series of chances and i have to praise my team for the way they kept going over 90 minutes , " said schaaf .
bremen clinched the points thanks to inspired half-time substitutions by schaaf and lead the table for the first time since late january .
aachen 's fourth successive defeat danish midfielder jensen , on for frank baumann , raced through the middle to take a pass by miroslav klose at the end of a fine bremen move to score the home side 's first in the 50th minute .
five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenberg , pasanen and owomoyela celebrate diego 's goal further chances went begging with diego screwing a shot wide and klose striking the post , and bremen almost paid the price when jan schlaudraff found himself with a chance , only for wiese to block .
aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .
it was a fourth successive defeat for aachen who remain deep in relegation danger just outside the immediate drop zone .
" we started well enough and created counter attacking opportunities but never really finished the moves off , " said aachen coach michael frontzeck .
" bremen then put us under a lot of pressure and in the end the goals had to come and they deserved their victory . "
good start not good enough the evening had begun well for the visitors who caught bremen cold in the second minute when pinto forced the ball over the line with the help of goalkeeper tim wiese .
the move had started with aachen 's pinto and marius ebbers escaping the offside trap .
ebbers raced down the right and his cross was met by pinto who kneed the ball towards goal at close range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pinto scored for aachen 's 1-0 lead the ball was blocked by wiese but came straight back as bremen midfielder torsten frings also tried to clear , but the prostrate pinto got his foot to the ball and wiese could only parry the midfielder 's second effort behind him and over the line .
in the main program saturday , the top game sees third-placed vfb stuttgart take on defending champions bayern munich .
stuttgart , who on wednesday reached the german cup final , are on 55 points , two points ahead of fourth-placed bayern .
among other games , bayer leverkusen play nuremberg - stuttgart 's cup final opponents - in a match between two teams fighting for uefa cup places next season .

1 , 2006 . the authors of the report , karl brenke and gert wagner , who conducted a statistical analysis , said that the expectation the world cup would significantly increase spending , were overly exaggerated . " the world cup 's contribution to economic growth has been negligible .

" one has to be able to statistically filter other variables to determine the sole effect of the world cup , " said kurscheidt . only one thing remains clear : from 2002 to 2005 , the infrastructure and promotion costs in hosting the big event boosted overall economic performance by barely 0.2 percent or at most 0.7 percent . not surprisingly , the main beneficiaries of the world cup largesse was fifa , the international soccer federation , and the german soccer association dfb , which cashed in 187 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- and 21 million euros respectively .
the restaurant industry , where bars and outdoor cafes broadcast the live games , profited handsomely , although the sunny skies also boosted public viewing on huge projection screens . boost for beer consumption and hotel bookings the world cup no doubt helped push up beer consumption in germany . overall , germans consumed a total of 92 million hectolitres -lrb- 2.43 billion gallons -rrb- of beer , which was 0.5 million more than in 2005 , according to the federal statistics office .
it was the first annual increase since 1999 following a declining trend in imbibing the golden ale . domestic and foreign tourists coming for the games also spent 500 million euros on goods and services , and temporarily boosted occupancy rates in hotels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish weather and brazilian high spirits did n't translate into a big rainmaker but the amount still fell far short of expectations .
germany 's postbank , one the world cup 's national sponsors , predicted a boost of up to 10 billion euros for the economy and 10,000 more long-term jobs created . wagner suggested that any positive financial outcome is tainted by perception .
" whoever expected to make profits would naturally want to attribute overall growth to the effects of the world cup , " said wagner . sports economist kurscheidt was even more critical in his analysis .
" before the 2002 soccer games in japan and south korea , big profit figures were floated around .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .

extraordinary in their size and character , they sprawl across more than 1,200 hectares -lrb- 3,707 acres -rrb- of land in and around berlin . " the prolific number of cemeteries is due to the city 's more recent history , " said hellmuth pohren-hartmann , the german author of a recent book on berlin 's friedenau cemetery , where hollywood legend marlene dietrich and famous berlin-born photographer helmut newton are buried . " when berlin was made the capital of the newly-founded german empire in 1871 , it was a pleasant though somewhat provincial city , " he said . bildunterschrift : weissensee jewish cemetery in northern berlin pohren-hartmann said that only later did it become a world-class metropolis , expanding in size via the incorporation of numerous surrounding towns , villages and communities in 1920 . " these towns and villages all had their own cemeteries , " points out pohren-hartmann .
" hence , the city 's wealth of burial places . " the city owns some cemeteries today , 90 of the cemeteries belong to the city-state of berlin , 118 to the german protestant church authorities , and nine to the roman catholic church . there are five jewish cemeteries in berlin , including europe 's largest site of jewish burial , in the city 's weissensee district .
there is also a muslim , a russian orthodox church and a british commonwealth war cemetery on the city 's heerstrasse , near the olympic stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of berlin 's first : dorotheenstädtische friedhof some berlin cemeteries were devastated during world war ii , and a few in the border area during the city 's postwar division were sealed by the communists and spiked with watch towers and border installations after the wall went up in 1961 . those devastations aside , berlin 's cemeteries are in remarkably good shape , having been handsomely restored , often by volunteer working groups . " the city 's cemeteries are something of a magnet for tourists nowadays , " pohren-hartmann said .
" especially for visiting ex-berliners who have moved abroad .
they make guided tours of the more famous burial places , feeling they are reliving history when doing so , " he said . gravestones as artworks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich 's spot in friedenau pohren-hartmann is active in the berlin historical cemetery network , created 10 years ago , which traces the history of municipal cemeteries and the lives of those buried there . " berlin 's cemeteries fascinatingly reflect the work of 19th century sculptors , " he said .
" more than 400 sculptors worked in the german capital during that period .
their work consisted of marble and bronze statues , wall engravings , reliefs , mausoleums and memorial works which are to be found in city cemeteries . " among them were sculptors with names like schadow , tieck , rauch , siemering , schaper , begas , tuaillon and gaul , whose work was greatly admired abroad . statues and monuments - made in berlin - were exported around the world .
the washington monument in philadelphia was designed by rudolf siemering , a gifted 19th century german sculptor . in south america , national monuments were masterminded by gustav eberlein , a prominent berlin sculptor , who also conceived the goethe memorial in rome . destroyed statues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial place at columbiadamm during world war ii , many of the city 's bronze statues were ordered to be melted down to help with the nazi war effort . afterwards , during berlin 's postwar division , prussian-made sculpture was frowned upon by the communist hierarchy in east berlin . the famous horse-riding statue of frederick the great was banished from its pedestal on unter den linden and confined to a shed in potsdam . not until the late 1970s did then east german leader erich honecker indulge in a spot of " rethinking history " and agree to the statue 's return to its original site , opposite the humboldt university . nowadays , the cost of maintaining berlin 's cemeteries causes headaches for those charged with their upkeep .
in many cases restoration work would hardly have been possible in recent years if it had n't been for donations from private individuals , foundations , and the state lottery . loss of income is primarily a result of people living longer , preferring cremation to burial in many cases when they die or simply wanting their ashes scattered at anonymous points around the country . a poet 's final resting place among cemeteries which attract a steady stream of visitors every year are the dorotheenstädtische friedhof in berlin 's mitte district .
it is there you find the grave of poet-playwright bertolt brecht in a tranquil , tree-shrouded corner plot . brecht was n't given to great extravagance , so it 's hardly surprising to find the humble stone commemorating him bears his name only on it , nothing more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright bertolt brecht 's quiet little corner the grave of sculptor gottfried schadow , designer of the quadriga atop the brandenburg gate , is also found in the cemetery , as is that of philosopher georg wilhelm friedrich hegel , whose fame spread far beyond germany 's borders in the early 1800s . at the holy trinity church in the kreuzberg district , you 'll find the grave of composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .
for years after world war ii , the musician 's grave was unrecognizable , just a weed-grown , rodent-frequented mound . a us army sergeant came across it in the early 1970s .
shocked , he sent a note to berlin 's mayor , pointing out the sad state of the grave and proposing a mendelssohn music festival be held in berlin mark the then 125th anniversary of his death . the reason for the shame was clear enough .
the long dead jewish-born composer had been erased from official memory by hitler and his music banned .
the mayor issued orders for the grave to be tended to immediately . since then , a mendelssohn music festival has been held in berlin every year .
not only that , the composer 's burial plot alongside that of his much loved sister fanny and other family members , was made an " honorary grave " on the mayor 's orders , which meant it would never be left unattended again . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court says no to diamond dad a german court ruled tuesday against a 19-year-old woman who wanted to have her late father 's ashes pressed into a diamond , saying she had failed to prove it was his dying wish .

extraordinary in their size and character , they sprawl across more than 1,200 hectares -lrb- 3,707 acres -rrb- of land in and around berlin . " the prolific number of cemeteries is due to the city 's more recent history , " said hellmuth pohren-hartmann , the german author of a recent book on berlin 's friedenau cemetery , where hollywood legend marlene dietrich and famous berlin-born photographer helmut newton are buried . " when berlin was made the capital of the newly-founded german empire in 1871 , it was a pleasant though somewhat provincial city , " he said . bildunterschrift : weissensee jewish cemetery in northern berlin pohren-hartmann said that only later did it become a world-class metropolis , expanding in size via the incorporation of numerous surrounding towns , villages and communities in 1920 . " these towns and villages all had their own cemeteries , " points out pohren-hartmann .
" hence , the city 's wealth of burial places . " the city owns some cemeteries today , 90 of the cemeteries belong to the city-state of berlin , 118 to the german protestant church authorities , and nine to the roman catholic church . there are five jewish cemeteries in berlin , including europe 's largest site of jewish burial , in the city 's weissensee district .

" the city 's cemeteries are something of a magnet for tourists nowadays , " pohren-hartmann said .
" especially for visiting ex-berliners who have moved abroad .

" berlin 's cemeteries fascinatingly reflect the work of 19th century sculptors , " he said .
" more than 400 sculptors worked in the german capital during that period .
their work consisted of marble and bronze statues , wall engravings , reliefs , mausoleums and memorial works which are to be found in city cemeteries . " among them were sculptors with names like schadow , tieck , rauch , siemering , schaper , begas , tuaillon and gaul , whose work was greatly admired abroad . statues and monuments - made in berlin - were exported around the world .
the washington monument in philadelphia was designed by rudolf siemering , a gifted 19th century german sculptor . in south america , national monuments were masterminded by gustav eberlein , a prominent berlin sculptor , who also conceived the goethe memorial in rome . destroyed statues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial place at columbiadamm during world war ii , many of the city 's bronze statues were ordered to be melted down to help with the nazi war effort . afterwards , during berlin 's postwar division , prussian-made sculpture was frowned upon by the communist hierarchy in east berlin . the famous horse-riding statue of frederick the great was banished from its pedestal on unter den linden and confined to a shed in potsdam . not until the late 1970s did then east german leader erich honecker indulge in a spot of " rethinking history " and agree to the statue 's return to its original site , opposite the humboldt university . nowadays , the cost of maintaining berlin 's cemeteries causes headaches for those charged with their upkeep .
in many cases restoration work would hardly have been possible in recent years if it had n't been for donations from private individuals , foundations , and the state lottery . loss of income is primarily a result of people living longer , preferring cremation to burial in many cases when they die or simply wanting their ashes scattered at anonymous points around the country . a poet 's final resting place among cemeteries which attract a steady stream of visitors every year are the dorotheenstädtische friedhof in berlin 's mitte district .
it is there you find the grave of poet-playwright bertolt brecht in a tranquil , tree-shrouded corner plot . brecht was n't given to great extravagance , so it 's hardly surprising to find the humble stone commemorating him bears his name only on it , nothing more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright bertolt brecht 's quiet little corner the grave of sculptor gottfried schadow , designer of the quadriga atop the brandenburg gate , is also found in the cemetery , as is that of philosopher georg wilhelm friedrich hegel , whose fame spread far beyond germany 's borders in the early 1800s . at the holy trinity church in the kreuzberg district , you 'll find the grave of composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .
for years after world war ii , the musician 's grave was unrecognizable , just a weed-grown , rodent-frequented mound . a us army sergeant came across it in the early 1970s .

the mayor issued orders for the grave to be tended to immediately . since then , a mendelssohn music festival has been held in berlin every year .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .

a superb third goal came in the final seconds when brazilian midfielder diego belted the ball out of his own half into an empty net after goalkeeper kristian nicht had come upfield for a free-kick .
the win takes thomas schaaf 's side onto 60 points with four matches remaining , one point ahead of schalke 04 who will go back to the top if they beat energie cottbus at home on saturday .
" aachen played well and were always looking to get forward but we had a series of chances and i have to praise my team for the way they kept going over 90 minutes , " said schaaf .
bremen clinched the points thanks to inspired half-time substitutions by schaaf and lead the table for the first time since late january .
aachen 's fourth successive defeat danish midfielder jensen , on for frank baumann , raced through the middle to take a pass by miroslav klose at the end of a fine bremen move to score the home side 's first in the 50th minute .
five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenberg , pasanen and owomoyela celebrate diego 's goal further chances went begging with diego screwing a shot wide and klose striking the post , and bremen almost paid the price when jan schlaudraff found himself with a chance , only for wiese to block .
aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .
it was a fourth successive defeat for aachen who remain deep in relegation danger just outside the immediate drop zone .
" we started well enough and created counter attacking opportunities but never really finished the moves off , " said aachen coach michael frontzeck .
" bremen then put us under a lot of pressure and in the end the goals had to come and they deserved their victory . "
good start not good enough the evening had begun well for the visitors who caught bremen cold in the second minute when pinto forced the ball over the line with the help of goalkeeper tim wiese .
the move had started with aachen 's pinto and marius ebbers escaping the offside trap .
ebbers raced down the right and his cross was met by pinto who kneed the ball towards goal at close range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pinto scored for aachen 's 1-0 lead the ball was blocked by wiese but came straight back as bremen midfielder torsten frings also tried to clear , but the prostrate pinto got his foot to the ball and wiese could only parry the midfielder 's second effort behind him and over the line .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 21.04.2007 soccer world cup hardly touched german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most tangible economic outcome of the world cup was its marketing value the patriotism and high spirits unleashed by this past summer 's world cup were expected to boost the german economy , but experts say the soccer event had virtually no impact on growth and employment . the world cup soccer fever which swept germany last summer had no meaningful effect for the overall economy , according to a report released this week by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . although consumer spending increased in the second half of last year , this was due mainly to the increase of the value-added tax on goods and services from 16 to 19 percent , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2006 . the authors of the report , karl brenke and gert wagner , who conducted a statistical analysis , said that the expectation the world cup would significantly increase spending , were overly exaggerated . " the world cup 's contribution to economic growth has been negligible .
it was great fun .
nothing more , nothing less , " said wagner , the institute 's research director of social risk management . problem filtering out single economic impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer consumption went up during the cup , despite a declining trend separating out the economic effects of a mega sports events from other business trends is problematic , said sports economist markus kurscheidt of the university of bochum . " one has to be able to statistically filter other variables to determine the sole effect of the world cup , " said kurscheidt . only one thing remains clear : from 2002 to 2005 , the infrastructure and promotion costs in hosting the big event boosted overall economic performance by barely 0.2 percent or at most 0.7 percent . not surprisingly , the main beneficiaries of the world cup largesse was fifa , the international soccer federation , and the german soccer association dfb , which cashed in 187 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- and 21 million euros respectively .
the restaurant industry , where bars and outdoor cafes broadcast the live games , profited handsomely , although the sunny skies also boosted public viewing on huge projection screens . boost for beer consumption and hotel bookings the world cup no doubt helped push up beer consumption in germany . overall , germans consumed a total of 92 million hectolitres -lrb- 2.43 billion gallons -rrb- of beer , which was 0.5 million more than in 2005 , according to the federal statistics office .
it was the first annual increase since 1999 following a declining trend in imbibing the golden ale . domestic and foreign tourists coming for the games also spent 500 million euros on goods and services , and temporarily boosted occupancy rates in hotels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish weather and brazilian high spirits did n't translate into a big rainmaker but the amount still fell far short of expectations .
germany 's postbank , one the world cup 's national sponsors , predicted a boost of up to 10 billion euros for the economy and 10,000 more long-term jobs created . wagner suggested that any positive financial outcome is tainted by perception .
" whoever expected to make profits would naturally want to attribute overall growth to the effects of the world cup , " said wagner . sports economist kurscheidt was even more critical in his analysis .
" before the 2002 soccer games in japan and south korea , big profit figures were floated around .
the world cup was supposed to overhaul the economies of whole countries , " he said . a month of partying both the diw and kurscheidt already had low expectations before the 2006 summer games even took off .
" the direct impetus could not have been so huge .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .

that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .

extraordinary in their size and character , they sprawl across more than 1,200 hectares -lrb- 3,707 acres -rrb- of land in and around berlin . " the prolific number of cemeteries is due to the city 's more recent history , " said hellmuth pohren-hartmann , the german author of a recent book on berlin 's friedenau cemetery , where hollywood legend marlene dietrich and famous berlin-born photographer helmut newton are buried . " when berlin was made the capital of the newly-founded german empire in 1871 , it was a pleasant though somewhat provincial city , " he said . bildunterschrift : weissensee jewish cemetery in northern berlin pohren-hartmann said that only later did it become a world-class metropolis , expanding in size via the incorporation of numerous surrounding towns , villages and communities in 1920 . " these towns and villages all had their own cemeteries , " points out pohren-hartmann .
" hence , the city 's wealth of burial places . " the city owns some cemeteries today , 90 of the cemeteries belong to the city-state of berlin , 118 to the german protestant church authorities , and nine to the roman catholic church . there are five jewish cemeteries in berlin , including europe 's largest site of jewish burial , in the city 's weissensee district .
there is also a muslim , a russian orthodox church and a british commonwealth war cemetery on the city 's heerstrasse , near the olympic stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of berlin 's first : dorotheenstädtische friedhof some berlin cemeteries were devastated during world war ii , and a few in the border area during the city 's postwar division were sealed by the communists and spiked with watch towers and border installations after the wall went up in 1961 . those devastations aside , berlin 's cemeteries are in remarkably good shape , having been handsomely restored , often by volunteer working groups . " the city 's cemeteries are something of a magnet for tourists nowadays , " pohren-hartmann said .
" especially for visiting ex-berliners who have moved abroad .
they make guided tours of the more famous burial places , feeling they are reliving history when doing so , " he said . gravestones as artworks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich 's spot in friedenau pohren-hartmann is active in the berlin historical cemetery network , created 10 years ago , which traces the history of municipal cemeteries and the lives of those buried there . " berlin 's cemeteries fascinatingly reflect the work of 19th century sculptors , " he said .
" more than 400 sculptors worked in the german capital during that period .
their work consisted of marble and bronze statues , wall engravings , reliefs , mausoleums and memorial works which are to be found in city cemeteries . " among them were sculptors with names like schadow , tieck , rauch , siemering , schaper , begas , tuaillon and gaul , whose work was greatly admired abroad . statues and monuments - made in berlin - were exported around the world .
the washington monument in philadelphia was designed by rudolf siemering , a gifted 19th century german sculptor . in south america , national monuments were masterminded by gustav eberlein , a prominent berlin sculptor , who also conceived the goethe memorial in rome . destroyed statues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial place at columbiadamm during world war ii , many of the city 's bronze statues were ordered to be melted down to help with the nazi war effort . afterwards , during berlin 's postwar division , prussian-made sculpture was frowned upon by the communist hierarchy in east berlin . the famous horse-riding statue of frederick the great was banished from its pedestal on unter den linden and confined to a shed in potsdam . not until the late 1970s did then east german leader erich honecker indulge in a spot of " rethinking history " and agree to the statue 's return to its original site , opposite the humboldt university . nowadays , the cost of maintaining berlin 's cemeteries causes headaches for those charged with their upkeep .
in many cases restoration work would hardly have been possible in recent years if it had n't been for donations from private individuals , foundations , and the state lottery . loss of income is primarily a result of people living longer , preferring cremation to burial in many cases when they die or simply wanting their ashes scattered at anonymous points around the country . a poet 's final resting place among cemeteries which attract a steady stream of visitors every year are the dorotheenstädtische friedhof in berlin 's mitte district .
it is there you find the grave of poet-playwright bertolt brecht in a tranquil , tree-shrouded corner plot . brecht was n't given to great extravagance , so it 's hardly surprising to find the humble stone commemorating him bears his name only on it , nothing more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright bertolt brecht 's quiet little corner the grave of sculptor gottfried schadow , designer of the quadriga atop the brandenburg gate , is also found in the cemetery , as is that of philosopher georg wilhelm friedrich hegel , whose fame spread far beyond germany 's borders in the early 1800s . at the holy trinity church in the kreuzberg district , you 'll find the grave of composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .
for years after world war ii , the musician 's grave was unrecognizable , just a weed-grown , rodent-frequented mound . a us army sergeant came across it in the early 1970s .
shocked , he sent a note to berlin 's mayor , pointing out the sad state of the grave and proposing a mendelssohn music festival be held in berlin mark the then 125th anniversary of his death . the reason for the shame was clear enough .
the long dead jewish-born composer had been erased from official memory by hitler and his music banned .
the mayor issued orders for the grave to be tended to immediately . since then , a mendelssohn music festival has been held in berlin every year .
not only that , the composer 's burial plot alongside that of his much loved sister fanny and other family members , was made an " honorary grave " on the mayor 's orders , which meant it would never be left unattended again . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court says no to diamond dad a german court ruled tuesday against a 19-year-old woman who wanted to have her late father 's ashes pressed into a diamond , saying she had failed to prove it was his dying wish .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .

both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .

personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .
felix steiner interviewed norbert lammert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding faith in the eu constitution what roles does christianity have in the eu constitution ?

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .
felix steiner interviewed norbert lammert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding faith in the eu constitution what roles does christianity have in the eu constitution ?
it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification .

while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .

1 , 2006 . the authors of the report , karl brenke and gert wagner , who conducted a statistical analysis , said that the expectation the world cup would significantly increase spending , were overly exaggerated . " the world cup 's contribution to economic growth has been negligible .
it was great fun .
nothing more , nothing less , " said wagner , the institute 's research director of social risk management . problem filtering out single economic impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer consumption went up during the cup , despite a declining trend separating out the economic effects of a mega sports events from other business trends is problematic , said sports economist markus kurscheidt of the university of bochum . " one has to be able to statistically filter other variables to determine the sole effect of the world cup , " said kurscheidt . only one thing remains clear : from 2002 to 2005 , the infrastructure and promotion costs in hosting the big event boosted overall economic performance by barely 0.2 percent or at most 0.7 percent . not surprisingly , the main beneficiaries of the world cup largesse was fifa , the international soccer federation , and the german soccer association dfb , which cashed in 187 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- and 21 million euros respectively .
the restaurant industry , where bars and outdoor cafes broadcast the live games , profited handsomely , although the sunny skies also boosted public viewing on huge projection screens . boost for beer consumption and hotel bookings the world cup no doubt helped push up beer consumption in germany . overall , germans consumed a total of 92 million hectolitres -lrb- 2.43 billion gallons -rrb- of beer , which was 0.5 million more than in 2005 , according to the federal statistics office .
it was the first annual increase since 1999 following a declining trend in imbibing the golden ale . domestic and foreign tourists coming for the games also spent 500 million euros on goods and services , and temporarily boosted occupancy rates in hotels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish weather and brazilian high spirits did n't translate into a big rainmaker but the amount still fell far short of expectations .
germany 's postbank , one the world cup 's national sponsors , predicted a boost of up to 10 billion euros for the economy and 10,000 more long-term jobs created . wagner suggested that any positive financial outcome is tainted by perception .
" whoever expected to make profits would naturally want to attribute overall growth to the effects of the world cup , " said wagner . sports economist kurscheidt was even more critical in his analysis .
" before the 2002 soccer games in japan and south korea , big profit figures were floated around .
the world cup was supposed to overhaul the economies of whole countries , " he said . a month of partying both the diw and kurscheidt already had low expectations before the 2006 summer games even took off .
" the direct impetus could not have been so huge .
one month of partying ca n't be a rainmaker for the entire year .
though that does n't necessarily mean that it had no effect whatsoever , " said kurscheidt . the most important outcome of a great sports event on the scale of an olympics or world cup is its public relations value , he added .
" and there we had tremendous luck : spanish weather , brazilian atmosphere , and the concept of the fan mile .
it could n't have been better . " oliver samson -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer fever - south africa 3 years to the world cup finals the soccer world cup in south africa - opportunity and challenge for the entire continent .

a superb third goal came in the final seconds when brazilian midfielder diego belted the ball out of his own half into an empty net after goalkeeper kristian nicht had come upfield for a free-kick .
the win takes thomas schaaf 's side onto 60 points with four matches remaining , one point ahead of schalke 04 who will go back to the top if they beat energie cottbus at home on saturday .
" aachen played well and were always looking to get forward but we had a series of chances and i have to praise my team for the way they kept going over 90 minutes , " said schaaf .
bremen clinched the points thanks to inspired half-time substitutions by schaaf and lead the table for the first time since late january .
aachen 's fourth successive defeat danish midfielder jensen , on for frank baumann , raced through the middle to take a pass by miroslav klose at the end of a fine bremen move to score the home side 's first in the 50th minute .
five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenberg , pasanen and owomoyela celebrate diego 's goal further chances went begging with diego screwing a shot wide and klose striking the post , and bremen almost paid the price when jan schlaudraff found himself with a chance , only for wiese to block .
aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .
it was a fourth successive defeat for aachen who remain deep in relegation danger just outside the immediate drop zone .
" we started well enough and created counter attacking opportunities but never really finished the moves off , " said aachen coach michael frontzeck .
" bremen then put us under a lot of pressure and in the end the goals had to come and they deserved their victory . "
good start not good enough the evening had begun well for the visitors who caught bremen cold in the second minute when pinto forced the ball over the line with the help of goalkeeper tim wiese .
the move had started with aachen 's pinto and marius ebbers escaping the offside trap .
ebbers raced down the right and his cross was met by pinto who kneed the ball towards goal at close range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pinto scored for aachen 's 1-0 lead the ball was blocked by wiese but came straight back as bremen midfielder torsten frings also tried to clear , but the prostrate pinto got his foot to the ball and wiese could only parry the midfielder 's second effort behind him and over the line .
in the main program saturday , the top game sees third-placed vfb stuttgart take on defending champions bayern munich .
stuttgart , who on wednesday reached the german cup final , are on 55 points , two points ahead of fourth-placed bayern .
among other games , bayer leverkusen play nuremberg - stuttgart 's cup final opponents - in a match between two teams fighting for uefa cup places next season .

the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .

extraordinary in their size and character , they sprawl across more than 1,200 hectares -lrb- 3,707 acres -rrb- of land in and around berlin . " the prolific number of cemeteries is due to the city 's more recent history , " said hellmuth pohren-hartmann , the german author of a recent book on berlin 's friedenau cemetery , where hollywood legend marlene dietrich and famous berlin-born photographer helmut newton are buried . " when berlin was made the capital of the newly-founded german empire in 1871 , it was a pleasant though somewhat provincial city , " he said . bildunterschrift : weissensee jewish cemetery in northern berlin pohren-hartmann said that only later did it become a world-class metropolis , expanding in size via the incorporation of numerous surrounding towns , villages and communities in 1920 . " these towns and villages all had their own cemeteries , " points out pohren-hartmann .
" hence , the city 's wealth of burial places . " the city owns some cemeteries today , 90 of the cemeteries belong to the city-state of berlin , 118 to the german protestant church authorities , and nine to the roman catholic church . there are five jewish cemeteries in berlin , including europe 's largest site of jewish burial , in the city 's weissensee district .
there is also a muslim , a russian orthodox church and a british commonwealth war cemetery on the city 's heerstrasse , near the olympic stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of berlin 's first : dorotheenstädtische friedhof some berlin cemeteries were devastated during world war ii , and a few in the border area during the city 's postwar division were sealed by the communists and spiked with watch towers and border installations after the wall went up in 1961 . those devastations aside , berlin 's cemeteries are in remarkably good shape , having been handsomely restored , often by volunteer working groups . " the city 's cemeteries are something of a magnet for tourists nowadays , " pohren-hartmann said .
" especially for visiting ex-berliners who have moved abroad .
they make guided tours of the more famous burial places , feeling they are reliving history when doing so , " he said . gravestones as artworks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich 's spot in friedenau pohren-hartmann is active in the berlin historical cemetery network , created 10 years ago , which traces the history of municipal cemeteries and the lives of those buried there . " berlin 's cemeteries fascinatingly reflect the work of 19th century sculptors , " he said .
" more than 400 sculptors worked in the german capital during that period .
their work consisted of marble and bronze statues , wall engravings , reliefs , mausoleums and memorial works which are to be found in city cemeteries . " among them were sculptors with names like schadow , tieck , rauch , siemering , schaper , begas , tuaillon and gaul , whose work was greatly admired abroad . statues and monuments - made in berlin - were exported around the world .
the washington monument in philadelphia was designed by rudolf siemering , a gifted 19th century german sculptor . in south america , national monuments were masterminded by gustav eberlein , a prominent berlin sculptor , who also conceived the goethe memorial in rome . destroyed statues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial place at columbiadamm during world war ii , many of the city 's bronze statues were ordered to be melted down to help with the nazi war effort . afterwards , during berlin 's postwar division , prussian-made sculpture was frowned upon by the communist hierarchy in east berlin . the famous horse-riding statue of frederick the great was banished from its pedestal on unter den linden and confined to a shed in potsdam . not until the late 1970s did then east german leader erich honecker indulge in a spot of " rethinking history " and agree to the statue 's return to its original site , opposite the humboldt university . nowadays , the cost of maintaining berlin 's cemeteries causes headaches for those charged with their upkeep .
in many cases restoration work would hardly have been possible in recent years if it had n't been for donations from private individuals , foundations , and the state lottery . loss of income is primarily a result of people living longer , preferring cremation to burial in many cases when they die or simply wanting their ashes scattered at anonymous points around the country . a poet 's final resting place among cemeteries which attract a steady stream of visitors every year are the dorotheenstädtische friedhof in berlin 's mitte district .
it is there you find the grave of poet-playwright bertolt brecht in a tranquil , tree-shrouded corner plot . brecht was n't given to great extravagance , so it 's hardly surprising to find the humble stone commemorating him bears his name only on it , nothing more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright bertolt brecht 's quiet little corner the grave of sculptor gottfried schadow , designer of the quadriga atop the brandenburg gate , is also found in the cemetery , as is that of philosopher georg wilhelm friedrich hegel , whose fame spread far beyond germany 's borders in the early 1800s . at the holy trinity church in the kreuzberg district , you 'll find the grave of composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .
for years after world war ii , the musician 's grave was unrecognizable , just a weed-grown , rodent-frequented mound . a us army sergeant came across it in the early 1970s .
shocked , he sent a note to berlin 's mayor , pointing out the sad state of the grave and proposing a mendelssohn music festival be held in berlin mark the then 125th anniversary of his death . the reason for the shame was clear enough .
the long dead jewish-born composer had been erased from official memory by hitler and his music banned .
the mayor issued orders for the grave to be tended to immediately . since then , a mendelssohn music festival has been held in berlin every year .
not only that , the composer 's burial plot alongside that of his much loved sister fanny and other family members , was made an " honorary grave " on the mayor 's orders , which meant it would never be left unattended again . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court says no to diamond dad a german court ruled tuesday against a 19-year-old woman who wanted to have her late father 's ashes pressed into a diamond , saying she had failed to prove it was his dying wish .

" when berlin was made the capital of the newly-founded german empire in 1871 , it was a pleasant though somewhat provincial city , " he said . bildunterschrift : weissensee jewish cemetery in northern berlin pohren-hartmann said that only later did it become a world-class metropolis , expanding in size via the incorporation of numerous surrounding towns , villages and communities in 1920 . " these towns and villages all had their own cemeteries , " points out pohren-hartmann .
" hence , the city 's wealth of burial places . " the city owns some cemeteries today , 90 of the cemeteries belong to the city-state of berlin , 118 to the german protestant church authorities , and nine to the roman catholic church . there are five jewish cemeteries in berlin , including europe 's largest site of jewish burial , in the city 's weissensee district .
there is also a muslim , a russian orthodox church and a british commonwealth war cemetery on the city 's heerstrasse , near the olympic stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of berlin 's first : dorotheenstädtische friedhof some berlin cemeteries were devastated during world war ii , and a few in the border area during the city 's postwar division were sealed by the communists and spiked with watch towers and border installations after the wall went up in 1961 . those devastations aside , berlin 's cemeteries are in remarkably good shape , having been handsomely restored , often by volunteer working groups . " the city 's cemeteries are something of a magnet for tourists nowadays , " pohren-hartmann said .
" especially for visiting ex-berliners who have moved abroad .
they make guided tours of the more famous burial places , feeling they are reliving history when doing so , " he said . gravestones as artworks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich 's spot in friedenau pohren-hartmann is active in the berlin historical cemetery network , created 10 years ago , which traces the history of municipal cemeteries and the lives of those buried there . " berlin 's cemeteries fascinatingly reflect the work of 19th century sculptors , " he said .
" more than 400 sculptors worked in the german capital during that period .
their work consisted of marble and bronze statues , wall engravings , reliefs , mausoleums and memorial works which are to be found in city cemeteries . " among them were sculptors with names like schadow , tieck , rauch , siemering , schaper , begas , tuaillon and gaul , whose work was greatly admired abroad . statues and monuments - made in berlin - were exported around the world .
the washington monument in philadelphia was designed by rudolf siemering , a gifted 19th century german sculptor . in south america , national monuments were masterminded by gustav eberlein , a prominent berlin sculptor , who also conceived the goethe memorial in rome . destroyed statues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial place at columbiadamm during world war ii , many of the city 's bronze statues were ordered to be melted down to help with the nazi war effort . afterwards , during berlin 's postwar division , prussian-made sculpture was frowned upon by the communist hierarchy in east berlin . the famous horse-riding statue of frederick the great was banished from its pedestal on unter den linden and confined to a shed in potsdam . not until the late 1970s did then east german leader erich honecker indulge in a spot of " rethinking history " and agree to the statue 's return to its original site , opposite the humboldt university . nowadays , the cost of maintaining berlin 's cemeteries causes headaches for those charged with their upkeep .
in many cases restoration work would hardly have been possible in recent years if it had n't been for donations from private individuals , foundations , and the state lottery . loss of income is primarily a result of people living longer , preferring cremation to burial in many cases when they die or simply wanting their ashes scattered at anonymous points around the country . a poet 's final resting place among cemeteries which attract a steady stream of visitors every year are the dorotheenstädtische friedhof in berlin 's mitte district .
it is there you find the grave of poet-playwright bertolt brecht in a tranquil , tree-shrouded corner plot . brecht was n't given to great extravagance , so it 's hardly surprising to find the humble stone commemorating him bears his name only on it , nothing more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright bertolt brecht 's quiet little corner the grave of sculptor gottfried schadow , designer of the quadriga atop the brandenburg gate , is also found in the cemetery , as is that of philosopher georg wilhelm friedrich hegel , whose fame spread far beyond germany 's borders in the early 1800s . at the holy trinity church in the kreuzberg district , you 'll find the grave of composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .
for years after world war ii , the musician 's grave was unrecognizable , just a weed-grown , rodent-frequented mound . a us army sergeant came across it in the early 1970s .
shocked , he sent a note to berlin 's mayor , pointing out the sad state of the grave and proposing a mendelssohn music festival be held in berlin mark the then 125th anniversary of his death . the reason for the shame was clear enough .
the long dead jewish-born composer had been erased from official memory by hitler and his music banned .
the mayor issued orders for the grave to be tended to immediately . since then , a mendelssohn music festival has been held in berlin every year .
not only that , the composer 's burial plot alongside that of his much loved sister fanny and other family members , was made an " honorary grave " on the mayor 's orders , which meant it would never be left unattended again . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court says no to diamond dad a german court ruled tuesday against a 19-year-old woman who wanted to have her late father 's ashes pressed into a diamond , saying she had failed to prove it was his dying wish .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .
felix steiner interviewed norbert lammert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding faith in the eu constitution what roles does christianity have in the eu constitution ?

extraordinary in their size and character , they sprawl across more than 1,200 hectares -lrb- 3,707 acres -rrb- of land in and around berlin . " the prolific number of cemeteries is due to the city 's more recent history , " said hellmuth pohren-hartmann , the german author of a recent book on berlin 's friedenau cemetery , where hollywood legend marlene dietrich and famous berlin-born photographer helmut newton are buried .

" the city 's cemeteries are something of a magnet for tourists nowadays , " pohren-hartmann said .

" berlin 's cemeteries fascinatingly reflect the work of 19th century sculptors , " he said .
" more than 400 sculptors worked in the german capital during that period .
their work consisted of marble and bronze statues , wall engravings , reliefs , mausoleums and memorial works which are to be found in city cemeteries .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .

a superb third goal came in the final seconds when brazilian midfielder diego belted the ball out of his own half into an empty net after goalkeeper kristian nicht had come upfield for a free-kick .
the win takes thomas schaaf 's side onto 60 points with four matches remaining , one point ahead of schalke 04 who will go back to the top if they beat energie cottbus at home on saturday .
" aachen played well and were always looking to get forward but we had a series of chances and i have to praise my team for the way they kept going over 90 minutes , " said schaaf .
bremen clinched the points thanks to inspired half-time substitutions by schaaf and lead the table for the first time since late january .
aachen 's fourth successive defeat danish midfielder jensen , on for frank baumann , raced through the middle to take a pass by miroslav klose at the end of a fine bremen move to score the home side 's first in the 50th minute .
five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenberg , pasanen and owomoyela celebrate diego 's goal further chances went begging with diego screwing a shot wide and klose striking the post , and bremen almost paid the price when jan schlaudraff found himself with a chance , only for wiese to block .
aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .
it was a fourth successive defeat for aachen who remain deep in relegation danger just outside the immediate drop zone .
" we started well enough and created counter attacking opportunities but never really finished the moves off , " said aachen coach michael frontzeck .
" bremen then put us under a lot of pressure and in the end the goals had to come and they deserved their victory . "
good start not good enough the evening had begun well for the visitors who caught bremen cold in the second minute when pinto forced the ball over the line with the help of goalkeeper tim wiese .
the move had started with aachen 's pinto and marius ebbers escaping the offside trap .
ebbers raced down the right and his cross was met by pinto who kneed the ball towards goal at close range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pinto scored for aachen 's 1-0 lead the ball was blocked by wiese but came straight back as bremen midfielder torsten frings also tried to clear , but the prostrate pinto got his foot to the ball and wiese could only parry the midfielder 's second effort behind him and over the line .
in the main program saturday , the top game sees third-placed vfb stuttgart take on defending champions bayern munich .
stuttgart , who on wednesday reached the german cup final , are on 55 points , two points ahead of fourth-placed bayern .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .

my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?

a superb third goal came in the final seconds when brazilian midfielder diego belted the ball out of his own half into an empty net after goalkeeper kristian nicht had come upfield for a free-kick .
the win takes thomas schaaf 's side onto 60 points with four matches remaining , one point ahead of schalke 04 who will go back to the top if they beat energie cottbus at home on saturday .
" aachen played well and were always looking to get forward but we had a series of chances and i have to praise my team for the way they kept going over 90 minutes , " said schaaf .
bremen clinched the points thanks to inspired half-time substitutions by schaaf and lead the table for the first time since late january .
aachen 's fourth successive defeat danish midfielder jensen , on for frank baumann , raced through the middle to take a pass by miroslav klose at the end of a fine bremen move to score the home side 's first in the 50th minute .
five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenberg , pasanen and owomoyela celebrate diego 's goal further chances went begging with diego screwing a shot wide and klose striking the post , and bremen almost paid the price when jan schlaudraff found himself with a chance , only for wiese to block .
aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .
it was a fourth successive defeat for aachen who remain deep in relegation danger just outside the immediate drop zone .
" we started well enough and created counter attacking opportunities but never really finished the moves off , " said aachen coach michael frontzeck .
" bremen then put us under a lot of pressure and in the end the goals had to come and they deserved their victory . "
good start not good enough the evening had begun well for the visitors who caught bremen cold in the second minute when pinto forced the ball over the line with the help of goalkeeper tim wiese .
the move had started with aachen 's pinto and marius ebbers escaping the offside trap .
ebbers raced down the right and his cross was met by pinto who kneed the ball towards goal at close range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pinto scored for aachen 's 1-0 lead the ball was blocked by wiese but came straight back as bremen midfielder torsten frings also tried to clear , but the prostrate pinto got his foot to the ball and wiese could only parry the midfielder 's second effort behind him and over the line .
in the main program saturday , the top game sees third-placed vfb stuttgart take on defending champions bayern munich .
stuttgart , who on wednesday reached the german cup final , are on 55 points , two points ahead of fourth-placed bayern .

both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .

a superb third goal came in the final seconds when brazilian midfielder diego belted the ball out of his own half into an empty net after goalkeeper kristian nicht had come upfield for a free-kick .
the win takes thomas schaaf 's side onto 60 points with four matches remaining , one point ahead of schalke 04 who will go back to the top if they beat energie cottbus at home on saturday .
" aachen played well and were always looking to get forward but we had a series of chances and i have to praise my team for the way they kept going over 90 minutes , " said schaaf .
bremen clinched the points thanks to inspired half-time substitutions by schaaf and lead the table for the first time since late january .
aachen 's fourth successive defeat danish midfielder jensen , on for frank baumann , raced through the middle to take a pass by miroslav klose at the end of a fine bremen move to score the home side 's first in the 50th minute .
five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenberg , pasanen and owomoyela celebrate diego 's goal further chances went begging with diego screwing a shot wide and klose striking the post , and bremen almost paid the price when jan schlaudraff found himself with a chance , only for wiese to block .
aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .
it was a fourth successive defeat for aachen who remain deep in relegation danger just outside the immediate drop zone .
" we started well enough and created counter attacking opportunities but never really finished the moves off , " said aachen coach michael frontzeck .
" bremen then put us under a lot of pressure and in the end the goals had to come and they deserved their victory . "
good start not good enough the evening had begun well for the visitors who caught bremen cold in the second minute when pinto forced the ball over the line with the help of goalkeeper tim wiese .
the move had started with aachen 's pinto and marius ebbers escaping the offside trap .
ebbers raced down the right and his cross was met by pinto who kneed the ball towards goal at close range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pinto scored for aachen 's 1-0 lead the ball was blocked by wiese but came straight back as bremen midfielder torsten frings also tried to clear , but the prostrate pinto got his foot to the ball and wiese could only parry the midfielder 's second effort behind him and over the line .
in the main program saturday , the top game sees third-placed vfb stuttgart take on defending champions bayern munich .
stuttgart , who on wednesday reached the german cup final , are on 55 points , two points ahead of fourth-placed bayern .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?

or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "

extraordinary in their size and character , they sprawl across more than 1,200 hectares -lrb- 3,707 acres -rrb- of land in and around berlin . " the prolific number of cemeteries is due to the city 's more recent history , " said hellmuth pohren-hartmann , the german author of a recent book on berlin 's friedenau cemetery , where hollywood legend marlene dietrich and famous berlin-born photographer helmut newton are buried . " when berlin was made the capital of the newly-founded german empire in 1871 , it was a pleasant though somewhat provincial city , " he said . bildunterschrift : weissensee jewish cemetery in northern berlin pohren-hartmann said that only later did it become a world-class metropolis , expanding in size via the incorporation of numerous surrounding towns , villages and communities in 1920 . " these towns and villages all had their own cemeteries , " points out pohren-hartmann .
" hence , the city 's wealth of burial places . " the city owns some cemeteries today , 90 of the cemeteries belong to the city-state of berlin , 118 to the german protestant church authorities , and nine to the roman catholic church . there are five jewish cemeteries in berlin , including europe 's largest site of jewish burial , in the city 's weissensee district .
there is also a muslim , a russian orthodox church and a british commonwealth war cemetery on the city 's heerstrasse , near the olympic stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of berlin 's first : dorotheenstädtische friedhof some berlin cemeteries were devastated during world war ii , and a few in the border area during the city 's postwar division were sealed by the communists and spiked with watch towers and border installations after the wall went up in 1961 . those devastations aside , berlin 's cemeteries are in remarkably good shape , having been handsomely restored , often by volunteer working groups . " the city 's cemeteries are something of a magnet for tourists nowadays , " pohren-hartmann said .
" especially for visiting ex-berliners who have moved abroad .
they make guided tours of the more famous burial places , feeling they are reliving history when doing so , " he said . gravestones as artworks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich 's spot in friedenau pohren-hartmann is active in the berlin historical cemetery network , created 10 years ago , which traces the history of municipal cemeteries and the lives of those buried there . " berlin 's cemeteries fascinatingly reflect the work of 19th century sculptors , " he said .
" more than 400 sculptors worked in the german capital during that period .
their work consisted of marble and bronze statues , wall engravings , reliefs , mausoleums and memorial works which are to be found in city cemeteries . " among them were sculptors with names like schadow , tieck , rauch , siemering , schaper , begas , tuaillon and gaul , whose work was greatly admired abroad . statues and monuments - made in berlin - were exported around the world .
the washington monument in philadelphia was designed by rudolf siemering , a gifted 19th century german sculptor . in south america , national monuments were masterminded by gustav eberlein , a prominent berlin sculptor , who also conceived the goethe memorial in rome . destroyed statues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial place at columbiadamm during world war ii , many of the city 's bronze statues were ordered to be melted down to help with the nazi war effort . afterwards , during berlin 's postwar division , prussian-made sculpture was frowned upon by the communist hierarchy in east berlin . the famous horse-riding statue of frederick the great was banished from its pedestal on unter den linden and confined to a shed in potsdam . not until the late 1970s did then east german leader erich honecker indulge in a spot of " rethinking history " and agree to the statue 's return to its original site , opposite the humboldt university . nowadays , the cost of maintaining berlin 's cemeteries causes headaches for those charged with their upkeep .
in many cases restoration work would hardly have been possible in recent years if it had n't been for donations from private individuals , foundations , and the state lottery . loss of income is primarily a result of people living longer , preferring cremation to burial in many cases when they die or simply wanting their ashes scattered at anonymous points around the country . a poet 's final resting place among cemeteries which attract a steady stream of visitors every year are the dorotheenstädtische friedhof in berlin 's mitte district .
it is there you find the grave of poet-playwright bertolt brecht in a tranquil , tree-shrouded corner plot . brecht was n't given to great extravagance , so it 's hardly surprising to find the humble stone commemorating him bears his name only on it , nothing more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright bertolt brecht 's quiet little corner the grave of sculptor gottfried schadow , designer of the quadriga atop the brandenburg gate , is also found in the cemetery , as is that of philosopher georg wilhelm friedrich hegel , whose fame spread far beyond germany 's borders in the early 1800s . at the holy trinity church in the kreuzberg district , you 'll find the grave of composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .
for years after world war ii , the musician 's grave was unrecognizable , just a weed-grown , rodent-frequented mound . a us army sergeant came across it in the early 1970s .
shocked , he sent a note to berlin 's mayor , pointing out the sad state of the grave and proposing a mendelssohn music festival be held in berlin mark the then 125th anniversary of his death . the reason for the shame was clear enough .
the long dead jewish-born composer had been erased from official memory by hitler and his music banned .
the mayor issued orders for the grave to be tended to immediately . since then , a mendelssohn music festival has been held in berlin every year .
not only that , the composer 's burial plot alongside that of his much loved sister fanny and other family members , was made an " honorary grave " on the mayor 's orders , which meant it would never be left unattended again . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court says no to diamond dad a german court ruled tuesday against a 19-year-old woman who wanted to have her late father 's ashes pressed into a diamond , saying she had failed to prove it was his dying wish .

extraordinary in their size and character , they sprawl across more than 1,200 hectares -lrb- 3,707 acres -rrb- of land in and around berlin . " the prolific number of cemeteries is due to the city 's more recent history , " said hellmuth pohren-hartmann , the german author of a recent book on berlin 's friedenau cemetery , where hollywood legend marlene dietrich and famous berlin-born photographer helmut newton are buried . " when berlin was made the capital of the newly-founded german empire in 1871 , it was a pleasant though somewhat provincial city , " he said . bildunterschrift : weissensee jewish cemetery in northern berlin pohren-hartmann said that only later did it become a world-class metropolis , expanding in size via the incorporation of numerous surrounding towns , villages and communities in 1920 . " these towns and villages all had their own cemeteries , " points out pohren-hartmann .
" hence , the city 's wealth of burial places . " the city owns some cemeteries today , 90 of the cemeteries belong to the city-state of berlin , 118 to the german protestant church authorities , and nine to the roman catholic church . there are five jewish cemeteries in berlin , including europe 's largest site of jewish burial , in the city 's weissensee district .
there is also a muslim , a russian orthodox church and a british commonwealth war cemetery on the city 's heerstrasse , near the olympic stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of berlin 's first : dorotheenstädtische friedhof some berlin cemeteries were devastated during world war ii , and a few in the border area during the city 's postwar division were sealed by the communists and spiked with watch towers and border installations after the wall went up in 1961 . those devastations aside , berlin 's cemeteries are in remarkably good shape , having been handsomely restored , often by volunteer working groups . " the city 's cemeteries are something of a magnet for tourists nowadays , " pohren-hartmann said .
" especially for visiting ex-berliners who have moved abroad .
they make guided tours of the more famous burial places , feeling they are reliving history when doing so , " he said . gravestones as artworks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich 's spot in friedenau pohren-hartmann is active in the berlin historical cemetery network , created 10 years ago , which traces the history of municipal cemeteries and the lives of those buried there . " berlin 's cemeteries fascinatingly reflect the work of 19th century sculptors , " he said .
" more than 400 sculptors worked in the german capital during that period .
their work consisted of marble and bronze statues , wall engravings , reliefs , mausoleums and memorial works which are to be found in city cemeteries . " among them were sculptors with names like schadow , tieck , rauch , siemering , schaper , begas , tuaillon and gaul , whose work was greatly admired abroad . statues and monuments - made in berlin - were exported around the world .
the washington monument in philadelphia was designed by rudolf siemering , a gifted 19th century german sculptor . in south america , national monuments were masterminded by gustav eberlein , a prominent berlin sculptor , who also conceived the goethe memorial in rome . destroyed statues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial place at columbiadamm during world war ii , many of the city 's bronze statues were ordered to be melted down to help with the nazi war effort . afterwards , during berlin 's postwar division , prussian-made sculpture was frowned upon by the communist hierarchy in east berlin . the famous horse-riding statue of frederick the great was banished from its pedestal on unter den linden and confined to a shed in potsdam . not until the late 1970s did then east german leader erich honecker indulge in a spot of " rethinking history " and agree to the statue 's return to its original site , opposite the humboldt university . nowadays , the cost of maintaining berlin 's cemeteries causes headaches for those charged with their upkeep .
in many cases restoration work would hardly have been possible in recent years if it had n't been for donations from private individuals , foundations , and the state lottery . loss of income is primarily a result of people living longer , preferring cremation to burial in many cases when they die or simply wanting their ashes scattered at anonymous points around the country . a poet 's final resting place among cemeteries which attract a steady stream of visitors every year are the dorotheenstädtische friedhof in berlin 's mitte district .
it is there you find the grave of poet-playwright bertolt brecht in a tranquil , tree-shrouded corner plot . brecht was n't given to great extravagance , so it 's hardly surprising to find the humble stone commemorating him bears his name only on it , nothing more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright bertolt brecht 's quiet little corner the grave of sculptor gottfried schadow , designer of the quadriga atop the brandenburg gate , is also found in the cemetery , as is that of philosopher georg wilhelm friedrich hegel , whose fame spread far beyond germany 's borders in the early 1800s . at the holy trinity church in the kreuzberg district , you 'll find the grave of composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .
for years after world war ii , the musician 's grave was unrecognizable , just a weed-grown , rodent-frequented mound . a us army sergeant came across it in the early 1970s .
shocked , he sent a note to berlin 's mayor , pointing out the sad state of the grave and proposing a mendelssohn music festival be held in berlin mark the then 125th anniversary of his death . the reason for the shame was clear enough .
the long dead jewish-born composer had been erased from official memory by hitler and his music banned .
the mayor issued orders for the grave to be tended to immediately . since then , a mendelssohn music festival has been held in berlin every year .
not only that , the composer 's burial plot alongside that of his much loved sister fanny and other family members , was made an " honorary grave " on the mayor 's orders , which meant it would never be left unattended again . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court says no to diamond dad a german court ruled tuesday against a 19-year-old woman who wanted to have her late father 's ashes pressed into a diamond , saying she had failed to prove it was his dying wish .

a superb third goal came in the final seconds when brazilian midfielder diego belted the ball out of his own half into an empty net after goalkeeper kristian nicht had come upfield for a free-kick .
the win takes thomas schaaf 's side onto 60 points with four matches remaining , one point ahead of schalke 04 who will go back to the top if they beat energie cottbus at home on saturday .
" aachen played well and were always looking to get forward but we had a series of chances and i have to praise my team for the way they kept going over 90 minutes , " said schaaf .
bremen clinched the points thanks to inspired half-time substitutions by schaaf and lead the table for the first time since late january .
aachen 's fourth successive defeat danish midfielder jensen , on for frank baumann , raced through the middle to take a pass by miroslav klose at the end of a fine bremen move to score the home side 's first in the 50th minute .
five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .

aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .
it was a fourth successive defeat for aachen who remain deep in relegation danger just outside the immediate drop zone .
" we started well enough and created counter attacking opportunities but never really finished the moves off , " said aachen coach michael frontzeck .
" bremen then put us under a lot of pressure and in the end the goals had to come and they deserved their victory . "
good start not good enough the evening had begun well for the visitors who caught bremen cold in the second minute when pinto forced the ball over the line with the help of goalkeeper tim wiese .
the move had started with aachen 's pinto and marius ebbers escaping the offside trap .
ebbers raced down the right and his cross was met by pinto who kneed the ball towards goal at close range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pinto scored for aachen 's 1-0 lead the ball was blocked by wiese but came straight back as bremen midfielder torsten frings also tried to clear , but the prostrate pinto got his foot to the ball and wiese could only parry the midfielder 's second effort behind him and over the line .

extraordinary in their size and character , they sprawl across more than 1,200 hectares -lrb- 3,707 acres -rrb- of land in and around berlin . " the prolific number of cemeteries is due to the city 's more recent history , " said hellmuth pohren-hartmann , the german author of a recent book on berlin 's friedenau cemetery , where hollywood legend marlene dietrich and famous berlin-born photographer helmut newton are buried . " when berlin was made the capital of the newly-founded german empire in 1871 , it was a pleasant though somewhat provincial city , " he said . bildunterschrift : weissensee jewish cemetery in northern berlin pohren-hartmann said that only later did it become a world-class metropolis , expanding in size via the incorporation of numerous surrounding towns , villages and communities in 1920 . " these towns and villages all had their own cemeteries , " points out pohren-hartmann .
" hence , the city 's wealth of burial places . " the city owns some cemeteries today , 90 of the cemeteries belong to the city-state of berlin , 118 to the german protestant church authorities , and nine to the roman catholic church . there are five jewish cemeteries in berlin , including europe 's largest site of jewish burial , in the city 's weissensee district .
there is also a muslim , a russian orthodox church and a british commonwealth war cemetery on the city 's heerstrasse , near the olympic stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of berlin 's first : dorotheenstädtische friedhof some berlin cemeteries were devastated during world war ii , and a few in the border area during the city 's postwar division were sealed by the communists and spiked with watch towers and border installations after the wall went up in 1961 . those devastations aside , berlin 's cemeteries are in remarkably good shape , having been handsomely restored , often by volunteer working groups . " the city 's cemeteries are something of a magnet for tourists nowadays , " pohren-hartmann said .
" especially for visiting ex-berliners who have moved abroad .
they make guided tours of the more famous burial places , feeling they are reliving history when doing so , " he said . gravestones as artworks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich 's spot in friedenau pohren-hartmann is active in the berlin historical cemetery network , created 10 years ago , which traces the history of municipal cemeteries and the lives of those buried there . " berlin 's cemeteries fascinatingly reflect the work of 19th century sculptors , " he said .
" more than 400 sculptors worked in the german capital during that period .
their work consisted of marble and bronze statues , wall engravings , reliefs , mausoleums and memorial works which are to be found in city cemeteries . " among them were sculptors with names like schadow , tieck , rauch , siemering , schaper , begas , tuaillon and gaul , whose work was greatly admired abroad . statues and monuments - made in berlin - were exported around the world .
the washington monument in philadelphia was designed by rudolf siemering , a gifted 19th century german sculptor . in south america , national monuments were masterminded by gustav eberlein , a prominent berlin sculptor , who also conceived the goethe memorial in rome . destroyed statues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial place at columbiadamm during world war ii , many of the city 's bronze statues were ordered to be melted down to help with the nazi war effort . afterwards , during berlin 's postwar division , prussian-made sculpture was frowned upon by the communist hierarchy in east berlin . the famous horse-riding statue of frederick the great was banished from its pedestal on unter den linden and confined to a shed in potsdam . not until the late 1970s did then east german leader erich honecker indulge in a spot of " rethinking history " and agree to the statue 's return to its original site , opposite the humboldt university . nowadays , the cost of maintaining berlin 's cemeteries causes headaches for those charged with their upkeep .
in many cases restoration work would hardly have been possible in recent years if it had n't been for donations from private individuals , foundations , and the state lottery . loss of income is primarily a result of people living longer , preferring cremation to burial in many cases when they die or simply wanting their ashes scattered at anonymous points around the country . a poet 's final resting place among cemeteries which attract a steady stream of visitors every year are the dorotheenstädtische friedhof in berlin 's mitte district .
it is there you find the grave of poet-playwright bertolt brecht in a tranquil , tree-shrouded corner plot . brecht was n't given to great extravagance , so it 's hardly surprising to find the humble stone commemorating him bears his name only on it , nothing more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright bertolt brecht 's quiet little corner the grave of sculptor gottfried schadow , designer of the quadriga atop the brandenburg gate , is also found in the cemetery , as is that of philosopher georg wilhelm friedrich hegel , whose fame spread far beyond germany 's borders in the early 1800s . at the holy trinity church in the kreuzberg district , you 'll find the grave of composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .
for years after world war ii , the musician 's grave was unrecognizable , just a weed-grown , rodent-frequented mound . a us army sergeant came across it in the early 1970s .
shocked , he sent a note to berlin 's mayor , pointing out the sad state of the grave and proposing a mendelssohn music festival be held in berlin mark the then 125th anniversary of his death . the reason for the shame was clear enough .
the long dead jewish-born composer had been erased from official memory by hitler and his music banned .
the mayor issued orders for the grave to be tended to immediately . since then , a mendelssohn music festival has been held in berlin every year .
not only that , the composer 's burial plot alongside that of his much loved sister fanny and other family members , was made an " honorary grave " on the mayor 's orders , which meant it would never be left unattended again . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court says no to diamond dad a german court ruled tuesday against a 19-year-old woman who wanted to have her late father 's ashes pressed into a diamond , saying she had failed to prove it was his dying wish .

1 , 2006 . the authors of the report , karl brenke and gert wagner , who conducted a statistical analysis , said that the expectation the world cup would significantly increase spending , were overly exaggerated . " the world cup 's contribution to economic growth has been negligible .

extraordinary in their size and character , they sprawl across more than 1,200 hectares -lrb- 3,707 acres -rrb- of land in and around berlin . " the prolific number of cemeteries is due to the city 's more recent history , " said hellmuth pohren-hartmann , the german author of a recent book on berlin 's friedenau cemetery , where hollywood legend marlene dietrich and famous berlin-born photographer helmut newton are buried . " when berlin was made the capital of the newly-founded german empire in 1871 , it was a pleasant though somewhat provincial city , " he said . bildunterschrift : weissensee jewish cemetery in northern berlin pohren-hartmann said that only later did it become a world-class metropolis , expanding in size via the incorporation of numerous surrounding towns , villages and communities in 1920 . " these towns and villages all had their own cemeteries , " points out pohren-hartmann .
" hence , the city 's wealth of burial places . " the city owns some cemeteries today , 90 of the cemeteries belong to the city-state of berlin , 118 to the german protestant church authorities , and nine to the roman catholic church . there are five jewish cemeteries in berlin , including europe 's largest site of jewish burial , in the city 's weissensee district .
there is also a muslim , a russian orthodox church and a british commonwealth war cemetery on the city 's heerstrasse , near the olympic stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of berlin 's first : dorotheenstädtische friedhof some berlin cemeteries were devastated during world war ii , and a few in the border area during the city 's postwar division were sealed by the communists and spiked with watch towers and border installations after the wall went up in 1961 . those devastations aside , berlin 's cemeteries are in remarkably good shape , having been handsomely restored , often by volunteer working groups . " the city 's cemeteries are something of a magnet for tourists nowadays , " pohren-hartmann said .
" especially for visiting ex-berliners who have moved abroad .
they make guided tours of the more famous burial places , feeling they are reliving history when doing so , " he said . gravestones as artworks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich 's spot in friedenau pohren-hartmann is active in the berlin historical cemetery network , created 10 years ago , which traces the history of municipal cemeteries and the lives of those buried there . " berlin 's cemeteries fascinatingly reflect the work of 19th century sculptors , " he said .
" more than 400 sculptors worked in the german capital during that period .
their work consisted of marble and bronze statues , wall engravings , reliefs , mausoleums and memorial works which are to be found in city cemeteries . " among them were sculptors with names like schadow , tieck , rauch , siemering , schaper , begas , tuaillon and gaul , whose work was greatly admired abroad . statues and monuments - made in berlin - were exported around the world .
the washington monument in philadelphia was designed by rudolf siemering , a gifted 19th century german sculptor . in south america , national monuments were masterminded by gustav eberlein , a prominent berlin sculptor , who also conceived the goethe memorial in rome . destroyed statues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial place at columbiadamm during world war ii , many of the city 's bronze statues were ordered to be melted down to help with the nazi war effort . afterwards , during berlin 's postwar division , prussian-made sculpture was frowned upon by the communist hierarchy in east berlin . the famous horse-riding statue of frederick the great was banished from its pedestal on unter den linden and confined to a shed in potsdam . not until the late 1970s did then east german leader erich honecker indulge in a spot of " rethinking history " and agree to the statue 's return to its original site , opposite the humboldt university . nowadays , the cost of maintaining berlin 's cemeteries causes headaches for those charged with their upkeep .
in many cases restoration work would hardly have been possible in recent years if it had n't been for donations from private individuals , foundations , and the state lottery . loss of income is primarily a result of people living longer , preferring cremation to burial in many cases when they die or simply wanting their ashes scattered at anonymous points around the country . a poet 's final resting place among cemeteries which attract a steady stream of visitors every year are the dorotheenstädtische friedhof in berlin 's mitte district .
it is there you find the grave of poet-playwright bertolt brecht in a tranquil , tree-shrouded corner plot . brecht was n't given to great extravagance , so it 's hardly surprising to find the humble stone commemorating him bears his name only on it , nothing more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright bertolt brecht 's quiet little corner the grave of sculptor gottfried schadow , designer of the quadriga atop the brandenburg gate , is also found in the cemetery , as is that of philosopher georg wilhelm friedrich hegel , whose fame spread far beyond germany 's borders in the early 1800s . at the holy trinity church in the kreuzberg district , you 'll find the grave of composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .
for years after world war ii , the musician 's grave was unrecognizable , just a weed-grown , rodent-frequented mound . a us army sergeant came across it in the early 1970s .
shocked , he sent a note to berlin 's mayor , pointing out the sad state of the grave and proposing a mendelssohn music festival be held in berlin mark the then 125th anniversary of his death . the reason for the shame was clear enough .
the long dead jewish-born composer had been erased from official memory by hitler and his music banned .
the mayor issued orders for the grave to be tended to immediately . since then , a mendelssohn music festival has been held in berlin every year .
not only that , the composer 's burial plot alongside that of his much loved sister fanny and other family members , was made an " honorary grave " on the mayor 's orders , which meant it would never be left unattended again . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court says no to diamond dad a german court ruled tuesday against a 19-year-old woman who wanted to have her late father 's ashes pressed into a diamond , saying she had failed to prove it was his dying wish .

a superb third goal came in the final seconds when brazilian midfielder diego belted the ball out of his own half into an empty net after goalkeeper kristian nicht had come upfield for a free-kick .
the win takes thomas schaaf 's side onto 60 points with four matches remaining , one point ahead of schalke 04 who will go back to the top if they beat energie cottbus at home on saturday .
" aachen played well and were always looking to get forward but we had a series of chances and i have to praise my team for the way they kept going over 90 minutes , " said schaaf .
bremen clinched the points thanks to inspired half-time substitutions by schaaf and lead the table for the first time since late january .
aachen 's fourth successive defeat danish midfielder jensen , on for frank baumann , raced through the middle to take a pass by miroslav klose at the end of a fine bremen move to score the home side 's first in the 50th minute .
five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenberg , pasanen and owomoyela celebrate diego 's goal further chances went begging with diego screwing a shot wide and klose striking the post , and bremen almost paid the price when jan schlaudraff found himself with a chance , only for wiese to block .
aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .
it was a fourth successive defeat for aachen who remain deep in relegation danger just outside the immediate drop zone .
" we started well enough and created counter attacking opportunities but never really finished the moves off , " said aachen coach michael frontzeck .
" bremen then put us under a lot of pressure and in the end the goals had to come and they deserved their victory . "
good start not good enough the evening had begun well for the visitors who caught bremen cold in the second minute when pinto forced the ball over the line with the help of goalkeeper tim wiese .
the move had started with aachen 's pinto and marius ebbers escaping the offside trap .
ebbers raced down the right and his cross was met by pinto who kneed the ball towards goal at close range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pinto scored for aachen 's 1-0 lead the ball was blocked by wiese but came straight back as bremen midfielder torsten frings also tried to clear , but the prostrate pinto got his foot to the ball and wiese could only parry the midfielder 's second effort behind him and over the line .

a superb third goal came in the final seconds when brazilian midfielder diego belted the ball out of his own half into an empty net after goalkeeper kristian nicht had come upfield for a free-kick .
the win takes thomas schaaf 's side onto 60 points with four matches remaining , one point ahead of schalke 04 who will go back to the top if they beat energie cottbus at home on saturday .
" aachen played well and were always looking to get forward but we had a series of chances and i have to praise my team for the way they kept going over 90 minutes , " said schaaf .
bremen clinched the points thanks to inspired half-time substitutions by schaaf and lead the table for the first time since late january .
aachen 's fourth successive defeat danish midfielder jensen , on for frank baumann , raced through the middle to take a pass by miroslav klose at the end of a fine bremen move to score the home side 's first in the 50th minute .
five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenberg , pasanen and owomoyela celebrate diego 's goal further chances went begging with diego screwing a shot wide and klose striking the post , and bremen almost paid the price when jan schlaudraff found himself with a chance , only for wiese to block .
aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .
it was a fourth successive defeat for aachen who remain deep in relegation danger just outside the immediate drop zone .
" we started well enough and created counter attacking opportunities but never really finished the moves off , " said aachen coach michael frontzeck .
" bremen then put us under a lot of pressure and in the end the goals had to come and they deserved their victory . "
good start not good enough the evening had begun well for the visitors who caught bremen cold in the second minute when pinto forced the ball over the line with the help of goalkeeper tim wiese .
the move had started with aachen 's pinto and marius ebbers escaping the offside trap .
ebbers raced down the right and his cross was met by pinto who kneed the ball towards goal at close range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pinto scored for aachen 's 1-0 lead the ball was blocked by wiese but came straight back as bremen midfielder torsten frings also tried to clear , but the prostrate pinto got his foot to the ball and wiese could only parry the midfielder 's second effort behind him and over the line .
in the main program saturday , the top game sees third-placed vfb stuttgart take on defending champions bayern munich .
stuttgart , who on wednesday reached the german cup final , are on 55 points , two points ahead of fourth-placed bayern .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .
felix steiner interviewed norbert lammert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding faith in the eu constitution what roles does christianity have in the eu constitution ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 21.04.2007 " every community needs a minimum of common orientation " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will additional diversity cause the eu to burst ?
in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .
felix steiner interviewed norbert lammert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding faith in the eu constitution what roles does christianity have in the eu constitution ?

a superb third goal came in the final seconds when brazilian midfielder diego belted the ball out of his own half into an empty net after goalkeeper kristian nicht had come upfield for a free-kick .
the win takes thomas schaaf 's side onto 60 points with four matches remaining , one point ahead of schalke 04 who will go back to the top if they beat energie cottbus at home on saturday .
" aachen played well and were always looking to get forward but we had a series of chances and i have to praise my team for the way they kept going over 90 minutes , " said schaaf .
bremen clinched the points thanks to inspired half-time substitutions by schaaf and lead the table for the first time since late january .
aachen 's fourth successive defeat danish midfielder jensen , on for frank baumann , raced through the middle to take a pass by miroslav klose at the end of a fine bremen move to score the home side 's first in the 50th minute .
five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenberg , pasanen and owomoyela celebrate diego 's goal further chances went begging with diego screwing a shot wide and klose striking the post , and bremen almost paid the price when jan schlaudraff found himself with a chance , only for wiese to block .
aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .
it was a fourth successive defeat for aachen who remain deep in relegation danger just outside the immediate drop zone .
" we started well enough and created counter attacking opportunities but never really finished the moves off , " said aachen coach michael frontzeck .
" bremen then put us under a lot of pressure and in the end the goals had to come and they deserved their victory . "
good start not good enough the evening had begun well for the visitors who caught bremen cold in the second minute when pinto forced the ball over the line with the help of goalkeeper tim wiese .
the move had started with aachen 's pinto and marius ebbers escaping the offside trap .
ebbers raced down the right and his cross was met by pinto who kneed the ball towards goal at close range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pinto scored for aachen 's 1-0 lead the ball was blocked by wiese but came straight back as bremen midfielder torsten frings also tried to clear , but the prostrate pinto got his foot to the ball and wiese could only parry the midfielder 's second effort behind him and over the line .
in the main program saturday , the top game sees third-placed vfb stuttgart take on defending champions bayern munich .
stuttgart , who on wednesday reached the german cup final , are on 55 points , two points ahead of fourth-placed bayern .
among other games , bayer leverkusen play nuremberg - stuttgart 's cup final opponents - in a match between two teams fighting for uefa cup places next season .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .
felix steiner interviewed norbert lammert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding faith in the eu constitution what roles does christianity have in the eu constitution ?

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .

a superb third goal came in the final seconds when brazilian midfielder diego belted the ball out of his own half into an empty net after goalkeeper kristian nicht had come upfield for a free-kick .
the win takes thomas schaaf 's side onto 60 points with four matches remaining , one point ahead of schalke 04 who will go back to the top if they beat energie cottbus at home on saturday .
" aachen played well and were always looking to get forward but we had a series of chances and i have to praise my team for the way they kept going over 90 minutes , " said schaaf .
bremen clinched the points thanks to inspired half-time substitutions by schaaf and lead the table for the first time since late january .
aachen 's fourth successive defeat danish midfielder jensen , on for frank baumann , raced through the middle to take a pass by miroslav klose at the end of a fine bremen move to score the home side 's first in the 50th minute .
five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenberg , pasanen and owomoyela celebrate diego 's goal further chances went begging with diego screwing a shot wide and klose striking the post , and bremen almost paid the price when jan schlaudraff found himself with a chance , only for wiese to block .
aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .
it was a fourth successive defeat for aachen who remain deep in relegation danger just outside the immediate drop zone .
" we started well enough and created counter attacking opportunities but never really finished the moves off , " said aachen coach michael frontzeck .
" bremen then put us under a lot of pressure and in the end the goals had to come and they deserved their victory . "
good start not good enough the evening had begun well for the visitors who caught bremen cold in the second minute when pinto forced the ball over the line with the help of goalkeeper tim wiese .
the move had started with aachen 's pinto and marius ebbers escaping the offside trap .
ebbers raced down the right and his cross was met by pinto who kneed the ball towards goal at close range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pinto scored for aachen 's 1-0 lead the ball was blocked by wiese but came straight back as bremen midfielder torsten frings also tried to clear , but the prostrate pinto got his foot to the ball and wiese could only parry the midfielder 's second effort behind him and over the line .

apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .

1 , 2006 . the authors of the report , karl brenke and gert wagner , who conducted a statistical analysis , said that the expectation the world cup would significantly increase spending , were overly exaggerated . " the world cup 's contribution to economic growth has been negligible .
it was great fun .
nothing more , nothing less , " said wagner , the institute 's research director of social risk management . problem filtering out single economic impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer consumption went up during the cup , despite a declining trend separating out the economic effects of a mega sports events from other business trends is problematic , said sports economist markus kurscheidt of the university of bochum . " one has to be able to statistically filter other variables to determine the sole effect of the world cup , " said kurscheidt . only one thing remains clear : from 2002 to 2005 , the infrastructure and promotion costs in hosting the big event boosted overall economic performance by barely 0.2 percent or at most 0.7 percent . not surprisingly , the main beneficiaries of the world cup largesse was fifa , the international soccer federation , and the german soccer association dfb , which cashed in 187 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- and 21 million euros respectively .
the restaurant industry , where bars and outdoor cafes broadcast the live games , profited handsomely , although the sunny skies also boosted public viewing on huge projection screens . boost for beer consumption and hotel bookings the world cup no doubt helped push up beer consumption in germany . overall , germans consumed a total of 92 million hectolitres -lrb- 2.43 billion gallons -rrb- of beer , which was 0.5 million more than in 2005 , according to the federal statistics office .
it was the first annual increase since 1999 following a declining trend in imbibing the golden ale . domestic and foreign tourists coming for the games also spent 500 million euros on goods and services , and temporarily boosted occupancy rates in hotels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish weather and brazilian high spirits did n't translate into a big rainmaker but the amount still fell far short of expectations .
germany 's postbank , one the world cup 's national sponsors , predicted a boost of up to 10 billion euros for the economy and 10,000 more long-term jobs created . wagner suggested that any positive financial outcome is tainted by perception .
" whoever expected to make profits would naturally want to attribute overall growth to the effects of the world cup , " said wagner . sports economist kurscheidt was even more critical in his analysis .
" before the 2002 soccer games in japan and south korea , big profit figures were floated around .
the world cup was supposed to overhaul the economies of whole countries , " he said . a month of partying both the diw and kurscheidt already had low expectations before the 2006 summer games even took off .
" the direct impetus could not have been so huge .
one month of partying ca n't be a rainmaker for the entire year .
though that does n't necessarily mean that it had no effect whatsoever , " said kurscheidt . the most important outcome of a great sports event on the scale of an olympics or world cup is its public relations value , he added .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .

it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .

a superb third goal came in the final seconds when brazilian midfielder diego belted the ball out of his own half into an empty net after goalkeeper kristian nicht had come upfield for a free-kick .
the win takes thomas schaaf 's side onto 60 points with four matches remaining , one point ahead of schalke 04 who will go back to the top if they beat energie cottbus at home on saturday .
" aachen played well and were always looking to get forward but we had a series of chances and i have to praise my team for the way they kept going over 90 minutes , " said schaaf .
bremen clinched the points thanks to inspired half-time substitutions by schaaf and lead the table for the first time since late january .
aachen 's fourth successive defeat danish midfielder jensen , on for frank baumann , raced through the middle to take a pass by miroslav klose at the end of a fine bremen move to score the home side 's first in the 50th minute .
five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenberg , pasanen and owomoyela celebrate diego 's goal further chances went begging with diego screwing a shot wide and klose striking the post , and bremen almost paid the price when jan schlaudraff found himself with a chance , only for wiese to block .
aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .
it was a fourth successive defeat for aachen who remain deep in relegation danger just outside the immediate drop zone .
" we started well enough and created counter attacking opportunities but never really finished the moves off , " said aachen coach michael frontzeck .
" bremen then put us under a lot of pressure and in the end the goals had to come and they deserved their victory . "
good start not good enough the evening had begun well for the visitors who caught bremen cold in the second minute when pinto forced the ball over the line with the help of goalkeeper tim wiese .
the move had started with aachen 's pinto and marius ebbers escaping the offside trap .
ebbers raced down the right and his cross was met by pinto who kneed the ball towards goal at close range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pinto scored for aachen 's 1-0 lead the ball was blocked by wiese but came straight back as bremen midfielder torsten frings also tried to clear , but the prostrate pinto got his foot to the ball and wiese could only parry the midfielder 's second effort behind him and over the line .

five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .

aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .
it was a fourth successive defeat for aachen who remain deep in relegation danger just outside the immediate drop zone .
" we started well enough and created counter attacking opportunities but never really finished the moves off , " said aachen coach michael frontzeck .
" bremen then put us under a lot of pressure and in the end the goals had to come and they deserved their victory . "
good start not good enough the evening had begun well for the visitors who caught bremen cold in the second minute when pinto forced the ball over the line with the help of goalkeeper tim wiese .
the move had started with aachen 's pinto and marius ebbers escaping the offside trap .
ebbers raced down the right and his cross was met by pinto who kneed the ball towards goal at close range .

extraordinary in their size and character , they sprawl across more than 1,200 hectares -lrb- 3,707 acres -rrb- of land in and around berlin . " the prolific number of cemeteries is due to the city 's more recent history , " said hellmuth pohren-hartmann , the german author of a recent book on berlin 's friedenau cemetery , where hollywood legend marlene dietrich and famous berlin-born photographer helmut newton are buried . " when berlin was made the capital of the newly-founded german empire in 1871 , it was a pleasant though somewhat provincial city , " he said . bildunterschrift : weissensee jewish cemetery in northern berlin pohren-hartmann said that only later did it become a world-class metropolis , expanding in size via the incorporation of numerous surrounding towns , villages and communities in 1920 . " these towns and villages all had their own cemeteries , " points out pohren-hartmann .
" hence , the city 's wealth of burial places . " the city owns some cemeteries today , 90 of the cemeteries belong to the city-state of berlin , 118 to the german protestant church authorities , and nine to the roman catholic church . there are five jewish cemeteries in berlin , including europe 's largest site of jewish burial , in the city 's weissensee district .
there is also a muslim , a russian orthodox church and a british commonwealth war cemetery on the city 's heerstrasse , near the olympic stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of berlin 's first : dorotheenstädtische friedhof some berlin cemeteries were devastated during world war ii , and a few in the border area during the city 's postwar division were sealed by the communists and spiked with watch towers and border installations after the wall went up in 1961 . those devastations aside , berlin 's cemeteries are in remarkably good shape , having been handsomely restored , often by volunteer working groups . " the city 's cemeteries are something of a magnet for tourists nowadays , " pohren-hartmann said .
" especially for visiting ex-berliners who have moved abroad .
they make guided tours of the more famous burial places , feeling they are reliving history when doing so , " he said . gravestones as artworks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich 's spot in friedenau pohren-hartmann is active in the berlin historical cemetery network , created 10 years ago , which traces the history of municipal cemeteries and the lives of those buried there . " berlin 's cemeteries fascinatingly reflect the work of 19th century sculptors , " he said .
" more than 400 sculptors worked in the german capital during that period .
their work consisted of marble and bronze statues , wall engravings , reliefs , mausoleums and memorial works which are to be found in city cemeteries . " among them were sculptors with names like schadow , tieck , rauch , siemering , schaper , begas , tuaillon and gaul , whose work was greatly admired abroad . statues and monuments - made in berlin - were exported around the world .
the washington monument in philadelphia was designed by rudolf siemering , a gifted 19th century german sculptor . in south america , national monuments were masterminded by gustav eberlein , a prominent berlin sculptor , who also conceived the goethe memorial in rome . destroyed statues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial place at columbiadamm during world war ii , many of the city 's bronze statues were ordered to be melted down to help with the nazi war effort . afterwards , during berlin 's postwar division , prussian-made sculpture was frowned upon by the communist hierarchy in east berlin . the famous horse-riding statue of frederick the great was banished from its pedestal on unter den linden and confined to a shed in potsdam . not until the late 1970s did then east german leader erich honecker indulge in a spot of " rethinking history " and agree to the statue 's return to its original site , opposite the humboldt university . nowadays , the cost of maintaining berlin 's cemeteries causes headaches for those charged with their upkeep .
in many cases restoration work would hardly have been possible in recent years if it had n't been for donations from private individuals , foundations , and the state lottery . loss of income is primarily a result of people living longer , preferring cremation to burial in many cases when they die or simply wanting their ashes scattered at anonymous points around the country . a poet 's final resting place among cemeteries which attract a steady stream of visitors every year are the dorotheenstädtische friedhof in berlin 's mitte district .
it is there you find the grave of poet-playwright bertolt brecht in a tranquil , tree-shrouded corner plot . brecht was n't given to great extravagance , so it 's hardly surprising to find the humble stone commemorating him bears his name only on it , nothing more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright bertolt brecht 's quiet little corner the grave of sculptor gottfried schadow , designer of the quadriga atop the brandenburg gate , is also found in the cemetery , as is that of philosopher georg wilhelm friedrich hegel , whose fame spread far beyond germany 's borders in the early 1800s . at the holy trinity church in the kreuzberg district , you 'll find the grave of composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .
for years after world war ii , the musician 's grave was unrecognizable , just a weed-grown , rodent-frequented mound . a us army sergeant came across it in the early 1970s .
shocked , he sent a note to berlin 's mayor , pointing out the sad state of the grave and proposing a mendelssohn music festival be held in berlin mark the then 125th anniversary of his death . the reason for the shame was clear enough .
the long dead jewish-born composer had been erased from official memory by hitler and his music banned .
the mayor issued orders for the grave to be tended to immediately . since then , a mendelssohn music festival has been held in berlin every year .
not only that , the composer 's burial plot alongside that of his much loved sister fanny and other family members , was made an " honorary grave " on the mayor 's orders , which meant it would never be left unattended again . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court says no to diamond dad a german court ruled tuesday against a 19-year-old woman who wanted to have her late father 's ashes pressed into a diamond , saying she had failed to prove it was his dying wish .

extraordinary in their size and character , they sprawl across more than 1,200 hectares -lrb- 3,707 acres -rrb- of land in and around berlin . " the prolific number of cemeteries is due to the city 's more recent history , " said hellmuth pohren-hartmann , the german author of a recent book on berlin 's friedenau cemetery , where hollywood legend marlene dietrich and famous berlin-born photographer helmut newton are buried . " when berlin was made the capital of the newly-founded german empire in 1871 , it was a pleasant though somewhat provincial city , " he said . bildunterschrift : weissensee jewish cemetery in northern berlin pohren-hartmann said that only later did it become a world-class metropolis , expanding in size via the incorporation of numerous surrounding towns , villages and communities in 1920 . " these towns and villages all had their own cemeteries , " points out pohren-hartmann .
" hence , the city 's wealth of burial places . " the city owns some cemeteries today , 90 of the cemeteries belong to the city-state of berlin , 118 to the german protestant church authorities , and nine to the roman catholic church . there are five jewish cemeteries in berlin , including europe 's largest site of jewish burial , in the city 's weissensee district .
there is also a muslim , a russian orthodox church and a british commonwealth war cemetery on the city 's heerstrasse , near the olympic stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of berlin 's first : dorotheenstädtische friedhof some berlin cemeteries were devastated during world war ii , and a few in the border area during the city 's postwar division were sealed by the communists and spiked with watch towers and border installations after the wall went up in 1961 . those devastations aside , berlin 's cemeteries are in remarkably good shape , having been handsomely restored , often by volunteer working groups . " the city 's cemeteries are something of a magnet for tourists nowadays , " pohren-hartmann said .
" especially for visiting ex-berliners who have moved abroad .
they make guided tours of the more famous burial places , feeling they are reliving history when doing so , " he said . gravestones as artworks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich 's spot in friedenau pohren-hartmann is active in the berlin historical cemetery network , created 10 years ago , which traces the history of municipal cemeteries and the lives of those buried there . " berlin 's cemeteries fascinatingly reflect the work of 19th century sculptors , " he said .
" more than 400 sculptors worked in the german capital during that period .
their work consisted of marble and bronze statues , wall engravings , reliefs , mausoleums and memorial works which are to be found in city cemeteries . " among them were sculptors with names like schadow , tieck , rauch , siemering , schaper , begas , tuaillon and gaul , whose work was greatly admired abroad . statues and monuments - made in berlin - were exported around the world .
the washington monument in philadelphia was designed by rudolf siemering , a gifted 19th century german sculptor . in south america , national monuments were masterminded by gustav eberlein , a prominent berlin sculptor , who also conceived the goethe memorial in rome . destroyed statues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial place at columbiadamm during world war ii , many of the city 's bronze statues were ordered to be melted down to help with the nazi war effort . afterwards , during berlin 's postwar division , prussian-made sculpture was frowned upon by the communist hierarchy in east berlin . the famous horse-riding statue of frederick the great was banished from its pedestal on unter den linden and confined to a shed in potsdam . not until the late 1970s did then east german leader erich honecker indulge in a spot of " rethinking history " and agree to the statue 's return to its original site , opposite the humboldt university . nowadays , the cost of maintaining berlin 's cemeteries causes headaches for those charged with their upkeep .
in many cases restoration work would hardly have been possible in recent years if it had n't been for donations from private individuals , foundations , and the state lottery . loss of income is primarily a result of people living longer , preferring cremation to burial in many cases when they die or simply wanting their ashes scattered at anonymous points around the country . a poet 's final resting place among cemeteries which attract a steady stream of visitors every year are the dorotheenstädtische friedhof in berlin 's mitte district .
it is there you find the grave of poet-playwright bertolt brecht in a tranquil , tree-shrouded corner plot . brecht was n't given to great extravagance , so it 's hardly surprising to find the humble stone commemorating him bears his name only on it , nothing more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright bertolt brecht 's quiet little corner the grave of sculptor gottfried schadow , designer of the quadriga atop the brandenburg gate , is also found in the cemetery , as is that of philosopher georg wilhelm friedrich hegel , whose fame spread far beyond germany 's borders in the early 1800s . at the holy trinity church in the kreuzberg district , you 'll find the grave of composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .
for years after world war ii , the musician 's grave was unrecognizable , just a weed-grown , rodent-frequented mound . a us army sergeant came across it in the early 1970s .
shocked , he sent a note to berlin 's mayor , pointing out the sad state of the grave and proposing a mendelssohn music festival be held in berlin mark the then 125th anniversary of his death . the reason for the shame was clear enough .
the long dead jewish-born composer had been erased from official memory by hitler and his music banned .
the mayor issued orders for the grave to be tended to immediately . since then , a mendelssohn music festival has been held in berlin every year .
not only that , the composer 's burial plot alongside that of his much loved sister fanny and other family members , was made an " honorary grave " on the mayor 's orders , which meant it would never be left unattended again . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court says no to diamond dad a german court ruled tuesday against a 19-year-old woman who wanted to have her late father 's ashes pressed into a diamond , saying she had failed to prove it was his dying wish .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .

is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .
i still remember the controversy provoked by the speech by former german president richard von weizsäcker 40 years after world war ii .
-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .

extraordinary in their size and character , they sprawl across more than 1,200 hectares -lrb- 3,707 acres -rrb- of land in and around berlin . " the prolific number of cemeteries is due to the city 's more recent history , " said hellmuth pohren-hartmann , the german author of a recent book on berlin 's friedenau cemetery , where hollywood legend marlene dietrich and famous berlin-born photographer helmut newton are buried . " when berlin was made the capital of the newly-founded german empire in 1871 , it was a pleasant though somewhat provincial city , " he said . bildunterschrift : weissensee jewish cemetery in northern berlin pohren-hartmann said that only later did it become a world-class metropolis , expanding in size via the incorporation of numerous surrounding towns , villages and communities in 1920 . " these towns and villages all had their own cemeteries , " points out pohren-hartmann .
" hence , the city 's wealth of burial places . " the city owns some cemeteries today , 90 of the cemeteries belong to the city-state of berlin , 118 to the german protestant church authorities , and nine to the roman catholic church . there are five jewish cemeteries in berlin , including europe 's largest site of jewish burial , in the city 's weissensee district .
there is also a muslim , a russian orthodox church and a british commonwealth war cemetery on the city 's heerstrasse , near the olympic stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of berlin 's first : dorotheenstädtische friedhof some berlin cemeteries were devastated during world war ii , and a few in the border area during the city 's postwar division were sealed by the communists and spiked with watch towers and border installations after the wall went up in 1961 . those devastations aside , berlin 's cemeteries are in remarkably good shape , having been handsomely restored , often by volunteer working groups . " the city 's cemeteries are something of a magnet for tourists nowadays , " pohren-hartmann said .
" especially for visiting ex-berliners who have moved abroad .
they make guided tours of the more famous burial places , feeling they are reliving history when doing so , " he said . gravestones as artworks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich 's spot in friedenau pohren-hartmann is active in the berlin historical cemetery network , created 10 years ago , which traces the history of municipal cemeteries and the lives of those buried there . " berlin 's cemeteries fascinatingly reflect the work of 19th century sculptors , " he said .
" more than 400 sculptors worked in the german capital during that period .
their work consisted of marble and bronze statues , wall engravings , reliefs , mausoleums and memorial works which are to be found in city cemeteries . " among them were sculptors with names like schadow , tieck , rauch , siemering , schaper , begas , tuaillon and gaul , whose work was greatly admired abroad . statues and monuments - made in berlin - were exported around the world .
the washington monument in philadelphia was designed by rudolf siemering , a gifted 19th century german sculptor . in south america , national monuments were masterminded by gustav eberlein , a prominent berlin sculptor , who also conceived the goethe memorial in rome . destroyed statues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial place at columbiadamm during world war ii , many of the city 's bronze statues were ordered to be melted down to help with the nazi war effort . afterwards , during berlin 's postwar division , prussian-made sculpture was frowned upon by the communist hierarchy in east berlin . the famous horse-riding statue of frederick the great was banished from its pedestal on unter den linden and confined to a shed in potsdam . not until the late 1970s did then east german leader erich honecker indulge in a spot of " rethinking history " and agree to the statue 's return to its original site , opposite the humboldt university . nowadays , the cost of maintaining berlin 's cemeteries causes headaches for those charged with their upkeep .
in many cases restoration work would hardly have been possible in recent years if it had n't been for donations from private individuals , foundations , and the state lottery . loss of income is primarily a result of people living longer , preferring cremation to burial in many cases when they die or simply wanting their ashes scattered at anonymous points around the country . a poet 's final resting place among cemeteries which attract a steady stream of visitors every year are the dorotheenstädtische friedhof in berlin 's mitte district .
it is there you find the grave of poet-playwright bertolt brecht in a tranquil , tree-shrouded corner plot . brecht was n't given to great extravagance , so it 's hardly surprising to find the humble stone commemorating him bears his name only on it , nothing more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright bertolt brecht 's quiet little corner the grave of sculptor gottfried schadow , designer of the quadriga atop the brandenburg gate , is also found in the cemetery , as is that of philosopher georg wilhelm friedrich hegel , whose fame spread far beyond germany 's borders in the early 1800s . at the holy trinity church in the kreuzberg district , you 'll find the grave of composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .
for years after world war ii , the musician 's grave was unrecognizable , just a weed-grown , rodent-frequented mound . a us army sergeant came across it in the early 1970s .
shocked , he sent a note to berlin 's mayor , pointing out the sad state of the grave and proposing a mendelssohn music festival be held in berlin mark the then 125th anniversary of his death . the reason for the shame was clear enough .
the long dead jewish-born composer had been erased from official memory by hitler and his music banned .
the mayor issued orders for the grave to be tended to immediately . since then , a mendelssohn music festival has been held in berlin every year .
not only that , the composer 's burial plot alongside that of his much loved sister fanny and other family members , was made an " honorary grave " on the mayor 's orders , which meant it would never be left unattended again . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court says no to diamond dad a german court ruled tuesday against a 19-year-old woman who wanted to have her late father 's ashes pressed into a diamond , saying she had failed to prove it was his dying wish .

1 , 2006 . the authors of the report , karl brenke and gert wagner , who conducted a statistical analysis , said that the expectation the world cup would significantly increase spending , were overly exaggerated . " the world cup 's contribution to economic growth has been negligible .
it was great fun .
nothing more , nothing less , " said wagner , the institute 's research director of social risk management . problem filtering out single economic impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer consumption went up during the cup , despite a declining trend separating out the economic effects of a mega sports events from other business trends is problematic , said sports economist markus kurscheidt of the university of bochum . " one has to be able to statistically filter other variables to determine the sole effect of the world cup , " said kurscheidt . only one thing remains clear : from 2002 to 2005 , the infrastructure and promotion costs in hosting the big event boosted overall economic performance by barely 0.2 percent or at most 0.7 percent . not surprisingly , the main beneficiaries of the world cup largesse was fifa , the international soccer federation , and the german soccer association dfb , which cashed in 187 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- and 21 million euros respectively .
the restaurant industry , where bars and outdoor cafes broadcast the live games , profited handsomely , although the sunny skies also boosted public viewing on huge projection screens . boost for beer consumption and hotel bookings the world cup no doubt helped push up beer consumption in germany . overall , germans consumed a total of 92 million hectolitres -lrb- 2.43 billion gallons -rrb- of beer , which was 0.5 million more than in 2005 , according to the federal statistics office .
it was the first annual increase since 1999 following a declining trend in imbibing the golden ale . domestic and foreign tourists coming for the games also spent 500 million euros on goods and services , and temporarily boosted occupancy rates in hotels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish weather and brazilian high spirits did n't translate into a big rainmaker but the amount still fell far short of expectations .
germany 's postbank , one the world cup 's national sponsors , predicted a boost of up to 10 billion euros for the economy and 10,000 more long-term jobs created . wagner suggested that any positive financial outcome is tainted by perception .
" whoever expected to make profits would naturally want to attribute overall growth to the effects of the world cup , " said wagner . sports economist kurscheidt was even more critical in his analysis .
" before the 2002 soccer games in japan and south korea , big profit figures were floated around .
the world cup was supposed to overhaul the economies of whole countries , " he said . a month of partying both the diw and kurscheidt already had low expectations before the 2006 summer games even took off .
" the direct impetus could not have been so huge .

extraordinary in their size and character , they sprawl across more than 1,200 hectares -lrb- 3,707 acres -rrb- of land in and around berlin . " the prolific number of cemeteries is due to the city 's more recent history , " said hellmuth pohren-hartmann , the german author of a recent book on berlin 's friedenau cemetery , where hollywood legend marlene dietrich and famous berlin-born photographer helmut newton are buried . " when berlin was made the capital of the newly-founded german empire in 1871 , it was a pleasant though somewhat provincial city , " he said . bildunterschrift : weissensee jewish cemetery in northern berlin pohren-hartmann said that only later did it become a world-class metropolis , expanding in size via the incorporation of numerous surrounding towns , villages and communities in 1920 . " these towns and villages all had their own cemeteries , " points out pohren-hartmann .
" hence , the city 's wealth of burial places . " the city owns some cemeteries today , 90 of the cemeteries belong to the city-state of berlin , 118 to the german protestant church authorities , and nine to the roman catholic church . there are five jewish cemeteries in berlin , including europe 's largest site of jewish burial , in the city 's weissensee district .
there is also a muslim , a russian orthodox church and a british commonwealth war cemetery on the city 's heerstrasse , near the olympic stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of berlin 's first : dorotheenstädtische friedhof some berlin cemeteries were devastated during world war ii , and a few in the border area during the city 's postwar division were sealed by the communists and spiked with watch towers and border installations after the wall went up in 1961 . those devastations aside , berlin 's cemeteries are in remarkably good shape , having been handsomely restored , often by volunteer working groups . " the city 's cemeteries are something of a magnet for tourists nowadays , " pohren-hartmann said .
" especially for visiting ex-berliners who have moved abroad .

" berlin 's cemeteries fascinatingly reflect the work of 19th century sculptors , " he said .
" more than 400 sculptors worked in the german capital during that period .
their work consisted of marble and bronze statues , wall engravings , reliefs , mausoleums and memorial works which are to be found in city cemeteries . " among them were sculptors with names like schadow , tieck , rauch , siemering , schaper , begas , tuaillon and gaul , whose work was greatly admired abroad . statues and monuments - made in berlin - were exported around the world .
the washington monument in philadelphia was designed by rudolf siemering , a gifted 19th century german sculptor . in south america , national monuments were masterminded by gustav eberlein , a prominent berlin sculptor , who also conceived the goethe memorial in rome . destroyed statues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial place at columbiadamm during world war ii , many of the city 's bronze statues were ordered to be melted down to help with the nazi war effort . afterwards , during berlin 's postwar division , prussian-made sculpture was frowned upon by the communist hierarchy in east berlin . the famous horse-riding statue of frederick the great was banished from its pedestal on unter den linden and confined to a shed in potsdam . not until the late 1970s did then east german leader erich honecker indulge in a spot of " rethinking history " and agree to the statue 's return to its original site , opposite the humboldt university . nowadays , the cost of maintaining berlin 's cemeteries causes headaches for those charged with their upkeep .
in many cases restoration work would hardly have been possible in recent years if it had n't been for donations from private individuals , foundations , and the state lottery . loss of income is primarily a result of people living longer , preferring cremation to burial in many cases when they die or simply wanting their ashes scattered at anonymous points around the country . a poet 's final resting place among cemeteries which attract a steady stream of visitors every year are the dorotheenstädtische friedhof in berlin 's mitte district .
it is there you find the grave of poet-playwright bertolt brecht in a tranquil , tree-shrouded corner plot . brecht was n't given to great extravagance , so it 's hardly surprising to find the humble stone commemorating him bears his name only on it , nothing more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright bertolt brecht 's quiet little corner the grave of sculptor gottfried schadow , designer of the quadriga atop the brandenburg gate , is also found in the cemetery , as is that of philosopher georg wilhelm friedrich hegel , whose fame spread far beyond germany 's borders in the early 1800s . at the holy trinity church in the kreuzberg district , you 'll find the grave of composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .
for years after world war ii , the musician 's grave was unrecognizable , just a weed-grown , rodent-frequented mound . a us army sergeant came across it in the early 1970s .

the long dead jewish-born composer had been erased from official memory by hitler and his music banned .
the mayor issued orders for the grave to be tended to immediately . since then , a mendelssohn music festival has been held in berlin every year .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .
without a constitution that sets new rules for the kind of cooperation and organization of decision making of the current 27 member states , the community is simply not able to expand - no matter what country we 're talking about .
the european parliament , which - just like national parliaments - has to approve further accessions , has already made it perfectly clear that it will not approve further accessions without a constitution .
i have no doubt that the same is true for the german parliament .
let me ask you again : where are europe 's borders in your opinion , assuming the reform agenda had been dealt with and the constitution had been successfully introduced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert : europe has no clear-cut geographical borders i 'm not so bold as to believe that i am the only one who has a clear and final answer to this question .
objectively speaking , the problem is that europe has no natural borders , especially when the region that we 're talking about is concerned : the eastern european region beyond the newer member states - poland , hungary , the czech republic ; and definitely not in terms of turkey .
that 's why this is a question of political definition , because in this case we can not base political decisions on geographic borders that serve as obvious criteria .
could there be cultural borders if there are no geographic borders , as you say ?
an eu as a common cultural area ?
this is indeed my personal preference .
but i expressly concede that there are also strong arguments for the opposite view , namely to see the european community as a bridge into other cultural areas .
both arguments deserve attention and have to be carefully weighed .
my reservations about the discussion so far have to do with the fact that this has largely been ignored so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the eu bridge the divide between cultures ?
personally , i am convinced that the internal consistency of a community depends mainly on the cultural identity that such as community does or does n't have .
this is certainly true for nation states and even more so for unions made up of nation states .
that 's why i fear that an intentional expansion into another cultural area will have grave consequences for the cultural identity , which in turn would have grave consequences for the political consistency of this community .
i want to bring up another concept that you have deal with publicly on several occasions : the concept of a leading culture .
does the european union need a leading culture and if so , which one would it be ?
undoubtedly - irrespective of whether one wants to use that term or not .
every community needs a minimum of common orientation and convictions in order to preserve its internal cohesion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe learn from rome 's ruins ?
apart from that , world history offers an abundance of examples of how this internal consistency was lost as states and empires expanded and how this in turn led to a loss of the ability to act politically within the respective system .
i also think that the consensus that this is necessary has grown tremendously over the last few months .
there are few people left that deny the need for such a minimum level of common orientation and convictions .
looking at germany : what should or what could be a german leading culture ?
what is it about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not a required part of a german leading culture i expressly avoid the term german leading culture .
apart from the misunderstandings about the term leading culture as a sign of domination , it also carries the misunderstanding that this is about specifically german , as opposed to non-german , values and orientations . in fact , there 's only one important aspect that 's specifically german in connection with the need for a minimum of common values that no society can live without - the language .
everything else is n't german , but european , western .
for this reason , i would advise us not to narrow the point of view in terms of what 's needed in germany .
it would n't live up to the issues at stake and definitely not to the historic developments .
how should such a leading culture be implemented for all those living in germany on a practical level ?
it can not be introduced by decree and can not be solved by exclusion - as in the case of eu accession negotiations .
the migrants are already here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants have to accept western values if they want to live in germany , lammert says yes , but migration does not have to prevent integration .
we 've realized for several years now that migration certainly does n't automatically lead to integration .
this already describes the problem and the task we 're facing : anyone who comes to germany , especially with the expectation to stay here , has to find the binding convictions and orientations acceptable .
if he can not do that because of religious , cultural or other convictions , he will not be able to stay permanently in this specific society .
is it possible to transfer this common set of values as a leading culture to a common set of values in light of german history ?
take questions such as : " was may 8 , 1945 a day of defeat or a day of liberation for germany ? "
or : " what did resistance against the nazi dictatorship look like and who can be described as belonging to the resistance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert swore in germany 's first female chancellor in 2005 that 's an interesting question , because it can be used to show that the same society can reach different conclusions and convictions over time about certain things .

-lrb- editors ' note : weizsäcker called may 8 a " day of liberation " in his speech . -rrb-
while he gave a prominent platform to a minority view - as far as i remember - at the time , it 's not become the dominant view within german society as far as i can tell .
let me touch on a second topic connected with the issue of integration that has a much longer history : gender equality .
today we say that it is an essential part of the common convictions of this society .
but a look at our own history makes us realize that this was certainly not always the case .

in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany . deutsche welle : mr. lammert , you have voiced your opposition to a turkish eu membership on several occasions in the past .
has the brutal murder of three employees of a christian publishing company in turkey this week strengthened or confirmed your rejection ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert at dw 's headquarters in bonn norbert lammert : no .
i would also strongly advice against making such superficial connections .
there are noteworthy arguments for , but also - in my opinion - at least equally noteworthy arguments against full eu membership for turkey .
a significant aspect of germany 's current political situation is that members of the country 's two largest parties sit in the same government and have completely opposite views on the matter .
everyone has agreed that the negotiations that have been started with turkey will be conducted without any preconceived conclusions .
that means that everyone involved has agreed that the issue will be decided in light of what will be achieved during the talks .
in previews interviews you have recommended that the eu limit itself - both in terms of the tasks that it takes on as well as the geographical expansion .
where should the eu end in your opinion ?
which countries , apart from turkey , should definitely not be included , assuming the entire internal reform agenda of the eu had been dealt with and the union 's ability to act had been completely restored ?
there are two basic aspects that do n't have anything to do with the concrete case of turkey to begin with .
one of them has to do with the fact , that the eu has avoided and sometimes even repressed the question of outer borders and where they are during the process of development and enlargement that took place during the last five decades .
i do n't think this question can be avoided much longer in the community 's year 50 plus x .
that 's especially true because every additional member state , no matter which one we want to fight over now , will bring about new membership applications .
because experience has shown that the consistency of a community wo n't be strengthened as the number of members grows , it 's important to resolve this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentarians are unwilling to approve expansion without a constitution there 's a second , equally fundamental issue - the current state of the union itself .

extraordinary in their size and character , they sprawl across more than 1,200 hectares -lrb- 3,707 acres -rrb- of land in and around berlin . " the prolific number of cemeteries is due to the city 's more recent history , " said hellmuth pohren-hartmann , the german author of a recent book on berlin 's friedenau cemetery , where hollywood legend marlene dietrich and famous berlin-born photographer helmut newton are buried . " when berlin was made the capital of the newly-founded german empire in 1871 , it was a pleasant though somewhat provincial city , " he said . bildunterschrift : weissensee jewish cemetery in northern berlin pohren-hartmann said that only later did it become a world-class metropolis , expanding in size via the incorporation of numerous surrounding towns , villages and communities in 1920 . " these towns and villages all had their own cemeteries , " points out pohren-hartmann .
" hence , the city 's wealth of burial places . " the city owns some cemeteries today , 90 of the cemeteries belong to the city-state of berlin , 118 to the german protestant church authorities , and nine to the roman catholic church . there are five jewish cemeteries in berlin , including europe 's largest site of jewish burial , in the city 's weissensee district .
there is also a muslim , a russian orthodox church and a british commonwealth war cemetery on the city 's heerstrasse , near the olympic stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of berlin 's first : dorotheenstädtische friedhof some berlin cemeteries were devastated during world war ii , and a few in the border area during the city 's postwar division were sealed by the communists and spiked with watch towers and border installations after the wall went up in 1961 . those devastations aside , berlin 's cemeteries are in remarkably good shape , having been handsomely restored , often by volunteer working groups . " the city 's cemeteries are something of a magnet for tourists nowadays , " pohren-hartmann said .
" especially for visiting ex-berliners who have moved abroad .
they make guided tours of the more famous burial places , feeling they are reliving history when doing so , " he said . gravestones as artworks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich 's spot in friedenau pohren-hartmann is active in the berlin historical cemetery network , created 10 years ago , which traces the history of municipal cemeteries and the lives of those buried there . " berlin 's cemeteries fascinatingly reflect the work of 19th century sculptors , " he said .
" more than 400 sculptors worked in the german capital during that period .
their work consisted of marble and bronze statues , wall engravings , reliefs , mausoleums and memorial works which are to be found in city cemeteries . " among them were sculptors with names like schadow , tieck , rauch , siemering , schaper , begas , tuaillon and gaul , whose work was greatly admired abroad . statues and monuments - made in berlin - were exported around the world .
the washington monument in philadelphia was designed by rudolf siemering , a gifted 19th century german sculptor . in south america , national monuments were masterminded by gustav eberlein , a prominent berlin sculptor , who also conceived the goethe memorial in rome . destroyed statues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial place at columbiadamm during world war ii , many of the city 's bronze statues were ordered to be melted down to help with the nazi war effort . afterwards , during berlin 's postwar division , prussian-made sculpture was frowned upon by the communist hierarchy in east berlin . the famous horse-riding statue of frederick the great was banished from its pedestal on unter den linden and confined to a shed in potsdam . not until the late 1970s did then east german leader erich honecker indulge in a spot of " rethinking history " and agree to the statue 's return to its original site , opposite the humboldt university . nowadays , the cost of maintaining berlin 's cemeteries causes headaches for those charged with their upkeep .
in many cases restoration work would hardly have been possible in recent years if it had n't been for donations from private individuals , foundations , and the state lottery . loss of income is primarily a result of people living longer , preferring cremation to burial in many cases when they die or simply wanting their ashes scattered at anonymous points around the country . a poet 's final resting place among cemeteries which attract a steady stream of visitors every year are the dorotheenstädtische friedhof in berlin 's mitte district .
it is there you find the grave of poet-playwright bertolt brecht in a tranquil , tree-shrouded corner plot . brecht was n't given to great extravagance , so it 's hardly surprising to find the humble stone commemorating him bears his name only on it , nothing more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright bertolt brecht 's quiet little corner the grave of sculptor gottfried schadow , designer of the quadriga atop the brandenburg gate , is also found in the cemetery , as is that of philosopher georg wilhelm friedrich hegel , whose fame spread far beyond germany 's borders in the early 1800s . at the holy trinity church in the kreuzberg district , you 'll find the grave of composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy .
for years after world war ii , the musician 's grave was unrecognizable , just a weed-grown , rodent-frequented mound . a us army sergeant came across it in the early 1970s .
shocked , he sent a note to berlin 's mayor , pointing out the sad state of the grave and proposing a mendelssohn music festival be held in berlin mark the then 125th anniversary of his death . the reason for the shame was clear enough .
the long dead jewish-born composer had been erased from official memory by hitler and his music banned .
the mayor issued orders for the grave to be tended to immediately . since then , a mendelssohn music festival has been held in berlin every year .
not only that , the composer 's burial plot alongside that of his much loved sister fanny and other family members , was made an " honorary grave " on the mayor 's orders , which meant it would never be left unattended again . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court says no to diamond dad a german court ruled tuesday against a 19-year-old woman who wanted to have her late father 's ashes pressed into a diamond , saying she had failed to prove it was his dying wish .

a superb third goal came in the final seconds when brazilian midfielder diego belted the ball out of his own half into an empty net after goalkeeper kristian nicht had come upfield for a free-kick .
the win takes thomas schaaf 's side onto 60 points with four matches remaining , one point ahead of schalke 04 who will go back to the top if they beat energie cottbus at home on saturday .
" aachen played well and were always looking to get forward but we had a series of chances and i have to praise my team for the way they kept going over 90 minutes , " said schaaf .
bremen clinched the points thanks to inspired half-time substitutions by schaaf and lead the table for the first time since late january .
aachen 's fourth successive defeat danish midfielder jensen , on for frank baumann , raced through the middle to take a pass by miroslav klose at the end of a fine bremen move to score the home side 's first in the 50th minute .
five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosenberg , pasanen and owomoyela celebrate diego 's goal further chances went begging with diego screwing a shot wide and klose striking the post , and bremen almost paid the price when jan schlaudraff found himself with a chance , only for wiese to block .
aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .
it was a fourth successive defeat for aachen who remain deep in relegation danger just outside the immediate drop zone .
" we started well enough and created counter attacking opportunities but never really finished the moves off , " said aachen coach michael frontzeck .
" bremen then put us under a lot of pressure and in the end the goals had to come and they deserved their victory . "
good start not good enough the evening had begun well for the visitors who caught bremen cold in the second minute when pinto forced the ball over the line with the help of goalkeeper tim wiese .
the move had started with aachen 's pinto and marius ebbers escaping the offside trap .
ebbers raced down the right and his cross was met by pinto who kneed the ball towards goal at close range .

a superb third goal came in the final seconds when brazilian midfielder diego belted the ball out of his own half into an empty net after goalkeeper kristian nicht had come upfield for a free-kick .
the win takes thomas schaaf 's side onto 60 points with four matches remaining , one point ahead of schalke 04 who will go back to the top if they beat energie cottbus at home on saturday .
" aachen played well and were always looking to get forward but we had a series of chances and i have to praise my team for the way they kept going over 90 minutes , " said schaaf .
bremen clinched the points thanks to inspired half-time substitutions by schaaf and lead the table for the first time since late january .
aachen 's fourth successive defeat danish midfielder jensen , on for frank baumann , raced through the middle to take a pass by miroslav klose at the end of a fine bremen move to score the home side 's first in the 50th minute .
five minutes later jensen hit a raking long pass and swedish striker marcus rosenberg , on for jurica vranjes , bustled off a challenge to strike the ball past nicht in goal .

aachen threw everything into grabbing a late equalizer but left their own goal completely empty for a last-gasp free-kick , and the ball was cleared to diego .
the midfielder , well inside his own half , took one look up and hit the ball down the pitch - a distance measured at 62 meters - for it to bounce over the line under the bar for bremen 's third .

councillor alistair watson , head of strathclyde partnership for transport , said the hi-tech maglev trains would cut the journey time to 15 minutes .
mr watson said he believed the trains could " transform " scotland 's economy .
he was responding to a new spt report into options for improving rail links between the cities .
a high-speed link between glasgow and edinburgh would transform the future growth potential of their economies councillor alistair watson the spt report examined all possible options for reducing journey times from glasgow to edinburgh from the current 50 minutes to at least 40 minutes , with half-an-hour highlighted as the ideal time .
after seeing the report , mr watson said : " the conventional options identified in the study , which are lowest cost , only take minutes off the journey time from glasgow to edinburgh or involve huge reconstruction costs to get the journey anywhere near 30 minutes .
" with the makers of the maglev system in the uk claiming their system can go from glasgow to edinburgh in 15 minutes , i think it 's time to look at that case in detail .
" it appears to me that maglev could be the most attractive option to emerge from this study .
such a high-speed link between glasgow and edinburgh would transform the future growth potential of their economies and of scotland 's economy as a whole . "
' modern demands ' the findings concluded that the maglev system was one of only two options considered which would create a sub-30minute journey time between the two cities .
the other involves building two tunnels in edinburgh and glasgow at a cost of £ 2.4bn.
the study identified maglev as an achievable long-term solution that needed further investigation .
mr watson added : " as this report shows , there are many issues we need to look at in much greater detail but , in my opinion , we need a high-speed rail link between scotland 's two largest cities to meet the demands of modern society .
" i believe this kind of bold investment to move our transport infrastructure into the 21st century and beyond would pay dividends .
look at what the channel tunnel has delivered for the uk economy . "
the other options looked at how existing rail routes between glasgow-shotts-edinburgh waverley and glasgow-carstairs-edinburgh waverley could be improved .
spt has agreed to further investigate all of the major options identified .
