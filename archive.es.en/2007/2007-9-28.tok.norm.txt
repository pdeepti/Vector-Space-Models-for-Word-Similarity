27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .

in january , a squabble between russia and belarus temporarily disrupted supplies headed towards western europe and past disputes over gas with ukraine have had similar consequences .
the belarus disruption convinced european politicians they needed to develop a new and united energy strategy that would help overcome the bloc 's members ' worries about sovereignty issues .
on wednesday , sept .
26 , the european parliament passed a resolution approving a special representative who will be tasked with negotiating energy issues with provider countries such as russia .
speaking with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing many interests this so-called " mr. energy , " as eu politicians have referred to the new delegate , will represent the common interests of europe and give the 27-member bloc a united front in dealing with exporters .

asian countries need to step forward and strongly condemn the regime , said dw 's klaus dahmann . pinning hopes on the united nations security council is often pointless .
once again , the council has left the impression that when its authority is needed the most , the highest un committee remains divided .
what sounds good on paper - the task of protecting world peace - has proved in practice to once again be a sham .
myanmar is the most recent example of this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dahmann during the cold war there were two great powers - the united states and the soviet union - which mutually blocked each other on principle .
nowadays , individual interests can water down toughly-worded draft resolutions .
the united states has on several occasions prevented a condemnation of israel 's use of force in the middle east .
russia 's support of serbia has pushed a solution to the future of kosovo far into the future .
and now it is china 's " no " that has stopped harsher action to be taken against the junta in myanmar .
the powerful 15-member council has too often proved to be a toothless tiger .
that has something to do with the fact that , with the end of the east-west conflict , the threat scenario has changed radically .
the former superpowers are no longer conducting proxy wars against each other in korea , vietnam or afghanistan .
instead , criminal power-hungry politicians who spark local wars , have taken their place .
the security council then duly notes that the un may not interfere with a country 's " internal affairs . "
that 's what china 's doing in myanmar - one really ca n't speak of a " threat to world peace , " a situation for which the un security council was created , says beijing .
and that is wrong .
the issue is no longer an " internal affair " when a regime , such as the one in myanmar , uses armed force against peaceful demonstrators , or when it arrests protesting citizens , or when it does not shy away from murder .
then it becomes an issue of defending basic human rights .
as the recent days have shown , doing nothing only encourages the generals to use still more force against the demonstrators .
those who should care the most about the crisis in myanmar - china and india - have long kept silent about these human rights violations .
china , with the olympics looming , should have every reason to want to present itself as a democratic " mr. clean " as does india , which prides itself on being the " world 's largest democracy . "
but china and india do n't want to endanger their economic interests in myanmar , a country rich in raw materials .
now , they have joined other association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- countries in finally issuing a statement on events in myanmar - but it comes late and is not enough .
it 's necessary to put more pressure on the junta in myanmar , pressure and the asean states chiefly must be the ones to apply it .
having a cruel , unjust regime in their neighbourhood is a latent risk that also threatens asean security .
and a democracy there would be a positive thing for their economic interests .
in the long run , asean and not the un must prove to be a functional organization in the myanmar case .

the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .
the plan also has the airline industry up in arms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are resisting following energy companies into joining europe 's carbon emissions trading scheme giovanni bisigani , director general and ceo of the geneva-based international air transport association or iata , which represents 250 airlines around the world , said the eu 's approach was " disappointing and irresponsible . "
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt airport is one of europe 's busiest the fees are not intended to raise the airport operators ' bottom-line , as revenue losses from airlines emitting the fewest emissions would be balanced by planes emitting more environmentally damaging nitrogen oxides .
the effect on ticket prices will depend on the airline , officials in berlin said .
companies operating older fleets may pass the higher fees on to customers while , ideally , the lower fees paid by airlines with more modern plane could lead to a drop in prices . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt airport is one of europe 's busiest the fees are not intended to raise the airport operators ' bottom-line , as revenue losses from airlines emitting the fewest emissions would be balanced by planes emitting more environmentally damaging nitrogen oxides .
the effect on ticket prices will depend on the airline , officials in berlin said .
companies operating older fleets may pass the higher fees on to customers while , ideally , the lower fees paid by airlines with more modern plane could lead to a drop in prices . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , president bush called for a " strong and transparent " way for nations to measure progress on fighting climate change but said that each country should set its own approach .
bush also called for the creation of a new global fund that would help developing nations pay for clean-energy projects .
the conference was the first in a series of talks among major polluting nations that bush has called for .
" our nations have an opportunity to leave the debates of the past behind and reach a consensus on the way forward and that 's our purpose today , " bush said to an audience that included representatives from european countries as well developing ones .
the us is the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases though experts believe china may soon surpass it .
" small step for mankind " however , the us president 's speech did n't convince many european officials who remained skeptical that the conference hosted by bush at the state department would help key un climate talks in bali in december .
the bali talks will aim to launch a successor to the kyoto protocol which sets limits on industrial nations ' emissions and which expires in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was not in a conciliatory mood " this here was a great step for the americans and a small step for mankind , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told journalists in washington .
" in substance , we are still far apart . "
bush 's emphasis on voluntary approaches rather than the firm targets pushed by many european countries also raised a few eyebrows .
a long-term goal for reducing global warming was needed , bush said , but added that " each nation will design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this . "
" one of the striking features of this meeting is how isolated this administration has become .
there is absolutely no support that i can see in the international community that we can drive this effort on the basis of voluntary efforts , " john ashton , a special representative on climate change for the british foreign secretary , said in an interview . " i do n't think that this meeting by itself moves the ball very much at all .
the much more significant meeting this week was at the un where there was a sense of urgency . "
criticism at odds with merkel 's statements bush 's proposal to expand nuclear energy to fight climate change and his statement that carbon dioxide emissions would be much higher today if it were n't for the 439 nuclear power plants worldwide was sharply criticised by germany 's gabriel .
" i do n't it 's particularly clever to give the world the message : build new nuclear plants , " gabriel said .
" first you urge people to expand nuclear energy and then you send in nato to bomb the nuclear power plants because they did the wrong thing - that is n't particularly intelligent politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was full of praise for bush 's initiative on climate change gabriel 's combativeness is in sharp contrast to chancellor angela merkel 's statements on us climate policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 28.09.2007 opinion : asian countries need to stand up to myanmar 's junta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council issued a benign statement of concern over myanmar 's violent crackdown against peaceful protestors .
asian countries need to step forward and strongly condemn the regime , said dw 's klaus dahmann . pinning hopes on the united nations security council is often pointless .
once again , the council has left the impression that when its authority is needed the most , the highest un committee remains divided .
what sounds good on paper - the task of protecting world peace - has proved in practice to once again be a sham .
myanmar is the most recent example of this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dahmann during the cold war there were two great powers - the united states and the soviet union - which mutually blocked each other on principle .
nowadays , individual interests can water down toughly-worded draft resolutions .
the united states has on several occasions prevented a condemnation of israel 's use of force in the middle east .
russia 's support of serbia has pushed a solution to the future of kosovo far into the future .
and now it is china 's " no " that has stopped harsher action to be taken against the junta in myanmar .
the powerful 15-member council has too often proved to be a toothless tiger .
that has something to do with the fact that , with the end of the east-west conflict , the threat scenario has changed radically .
the former superpowers are no longer conducting proxy wars against each other in korea , vietnam or afghanistan .
instead , criminal power-hungry politicians who spark local wars , have taken their place .
the security council then duly notes that the un may not interfere with a country 's " internal affairs . "
that 's what china 's doing in myanmar - one really ca n't speak of a " threat to world peace , " a situation for which the un security council was created , says beijing .
and that is wrong .
the issue is no longer an " internal affair " when a regime , such as the one in myanmar , uses armed force against peaceful demonstrators , or when it arrests protesting citizens , or when it does not shy away from murder .
then it becomes an issue of defending basic human rights .
as the recent days have shown , doing nothing only encourages the generals to use still more force against the demonstrators .
those who should care the most about the crisis in myanmar - china and india - have long kept silent about these human rights violations .
china , with the olympics looming , should have every reason to want to present itself as a democratic " mr. clean " as does india , which prides itself on being the " world 's largest democracy . "
but china and india do n't want to endanger their economic interests in myanmar , a country rich in raw materials .
now , they have joined other association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- countries in finally issuing a statement on events in myanmar - but it comes late and is not enough .
it 's necessary to put more pressure on the junta in myanmar , pressure and the asean states chiefly must be the ones to apply it .
having a cruel , unjust regime in their neighbourhood is a latent risk that also threatens asean security .
and a democracy there would be a positive thing for their economic interests .
in the long run , asean and not the un must prove to be a functional organization in the myanmar case .

the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .
the plan also has the airline industry up in arms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are resisting following energy companies into joining europe 's carbon emissions trading scheme giovanni bisigani , director general and ceo of the geneva-based international air transport association or iata , which represents 250 airlines around the world , said the eu 's approach was " disappointing and irresponsible . "
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt airport is one of europe 's busiest the fees are not intended to raise the airport operators ' bottom-line , as revenue losses from airlines emitting the fewest emissions would be balanced by planes emitting more environmentally damaging nitrogen oxides .
the effect on ticket prices will depend on the airline , officials in berlin said .

the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .
the plan also has the airline industry up in arms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are resisting following energy companies into joining europe 's carbon emissions trading scheme giovanni bisigani , director general and ceo of the geneva-based international air transport association or iata , which represents 250 airlines around the world , said the eu 's approach was " disappointing and irresponsible . "
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 28.09.2007 " mr. energy " and the future of european energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is reliant on energy imports in a bid to protect itself from capricious oil providers , the european union announced it would establish a new energy strategist to coordinate a united approach to international energy issues . russian oil is flowing to europe unhindered these days , but , as europe has learned , the oil giant can at times be an unreliable supplier .
in january , a squabble between russia and belarus temporarily disrupted supplies headed towards western europe and past disputes over gas with ukraine have had similar consequences .
the belarus disruption convinced european politicians they needed to develop a new and united energy strategy that would help overcome the bloc 's members ' worries about sovereignty issues .
on wednesday , sept .
26 , the european parliament passed a resolution approving a special representative who will be tasked with negotiating energy issues with provider countries such as russia .
speaking with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing many interests this so-called " mr. energy , " as eu politicians have referred to the new delegate , will represent the common interests of europe and give the 27-member bloc a united front in dealing with exporters .
additionally , " mr. energy " will work to prevent a future crisis which could be caused , for example , by a long-term disruption in russian gas or oil .
in the case of a supply shortfall , the representative would develop an internal eu solidarity mechanism .
polish christian democrat jacek saryusz-wolski , currently head of the eu foreign affairs committee , authored the resolution .
a total of 553 parliamentarians voted for the idea while 103 voted against it and 27 abstained .
" this is a new starting point for a united foreign policy of the union , " saryusz-wolski said .
no more baby steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to prevent shortages " the european energy policy is no longer in its infancy , " said kristina notz , an expert in energy policy for the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich .
" we 've at last arrived at the implementation phase .
the basics have been clarified , now the question is the details . "
those details are on the mind of ferran tarradellas espuny , spokesman for energy commissioner andris piebalgs about parliamentary resolution .
" mr. energy " needs his responsibilities to be clearly outlined , which is missing from the current proposal , tarradellas espuny said . whether the energy representative should focus on gas or oil prices , the role of diversification of energy sources and what to do if a crisis occurs , were among the issues tarradellas espuny said still needed to be addressed .
poland wants energy solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connected and coordinated : europe 's future energy regime poland was a vocal proponent of including a solidarity clause in the eu legislation .
the country depends on russian gas and oil for about 90 percent of its energy imports and also serves as transit country for energy headed further west .
a solidarity clause would help poland in case of an interruption in its supply from russia .
but poland has been criticized for pushing energy solidarity while remaining opposed to other eu initiatives , such as the current attempt to reform the eu charter and its past opposition to the eu negotiating energy issues with russia over domestic trade issues .
diversification remains fundamental bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe looks towards sun and wind alternatives europe has realized it needs to diversify .
officials have called for both increasing the use of alternative energies , including such as solar and wind energy , as well as finding new sources for oil and gas .
norway and algeria are among the eu 's current favorites .
norway currently provides about 15 percent of the eu 's oil requirements .
on thursday , the country announced it would increase its exports from 55 billion to 78 billion cubic meters -lrb- 72 billion to 102 billion cubic yards -rrb- in 2010 .
in december , the eu is set to announce a framework directive for renewable energy and a strategic plan for energy technologies .

polish christian democrat jacek saryusz-wolski , currently head of the eu foreign affairs committee , authored the resolution .
a total of 553 parliamentarians voted for the idea while 103 voted against it and 27 abstained .
" this is a new starting point for a united foreign policy of the union , " saryusz-wolski said .
no more baby steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to prevent shortages " the european energy policy is no longer in its infancy , " said kristina notz , an expert in energy policy for the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich .
" we 've at last arrived at the implementation phase .
the basics have been clarified , now the question is the details . "
those details are on the mind of ferran tarradellas espuny , spokesman for energy commissioner andris piebalgs about parliamentary resolution .
" mr. energy " needs his responsibilities to be clearly outlined , which is missing from the current proposal , tarradellas espuny said . whether the energy representative should focus on gas or oil prices , the role of diversification of energy sources and what to do if a crisis occurs , were among the issues tarradellas espuny said still needed to be addressed .
poland wants energy solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connected and coordinated : europe 's future energy regime poland was a vocal proponent of including a solidarity clause in the eu legislation .
the country depends on russian gas and oil for about 90 percent of its energy imports and also serves as transit country for energy headed further west .
a solidarity clause would help poland in case of an interruption in its supply from russia .
but poland has been criticized for pushing energy solidarity while remaining opposed to other eu initiatives , such as the current attempt to reform the eu charter and its past opposition to the eu negotiating energy issues with russia over domestic trade issues .
diversification remains fundamental bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe looks towards sun and wind alternatives europe has realized it needs to diversify .
officials have called for both increasing the use of alternative energies , including such as solar and wind energy , as well as finding new sources for oil and gas .
norway and algeria are among the eu 's current favorites .
norway currently provides about 15 percent of the eu 's oil requirements .
on thursday , the country announced it would increase its exports from 55 billion to 78 billion cubic meters -lrb- 72 billion to 102 billion cubic yards -rrb- in 2010 .
in december , the eu is set to announce a framework directive for renewable energy and a strategic plan for energy technologies .

28 , president bush called for a " strong and transparent " way for nations to measure progress on fighting climate change but said that each country should set its own approach .
bush also called for the creation of a new global fund that would help developing nations pay for clean-energy projects .
the conference was the first in a series of talks among major polluting nations that bush has called for .
" our nations have an opportunity to leave the debates of the past behind and reach a consensus on the way forward and that 's our purpose today , " bush said to an audience that included representatives from european countries as well developing ones .
the us is the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases though experts believe china may soon surpass it .
" small step for mankind " however , the us president 's speech did n't convince many european officials who remained skeptical that the conference hosted by bush at the state department would help key un climate talks in bali in december .
the bali talks will aim to launch a successor to the kyoto protocol which sets limits on industrial nations ' emissions and which expires in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was not in a conciliatory mood " this here was a great step for the americans and a small step for mankind , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told journalists in washington .
" in substance , we are still far apart . "
bush 's emphasis on voluntary approaches rather than the firm targets pushed by many european countries also raised a few eyebrows .
a long-term goal for reducing global warming was needed , bush said , but added that " each nation will design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this . "
" one of the striking features of this meeting is how isolated this administration has become .
there is absolutely no support that i can see in the international community that we can drive this effort on the basis of voluntary efforts , " john ashton , a special representative on climate change for the british foreign secretary , said in an interview . " i do n't think that this meeting by itself moves the ball very much at all .
the much more significant meeting this week was at the un where there was a sense of urgency . "
criticism at odds with merkel 's statements bush 's proposal to expand nuclear energy to fight climate change and his statement that carbon dioxide emissions would be much higher today if it were n't for the 439 nuclear power plants worldwide was sharply criticised by germany 's gabriel .
" i do n't it 's particularly clever to give the world the message : build new nuclear plants , " gabriel said .
" first you urge people to expand nuclear energy and then you send in nato to bomb the nuclear power plants because they did the wrong thing - that is n't particularly intelligent politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was full of praise for bush 's initiative on climate change gabriel 's combativeness is in sharp contrast to chancellor angela merkel 's statements on us climate policy .
earlier this week at the sidelines of the un assembly in new york , merkel welcomed bush 's invitation to the world 's 16 worst polluters for climate talks .

28 , president bush called for a " strong and transparent " way for nations to measure progress on fighting climate change but said that each country should set its own approach .
bush also called for the creation of a new global fund that would help developing nations pay for clean-energy projects .
the conference was the first in a series of talks among major polluting nations that bush has called for .
" our nations have an opportunity to leave the debates of the past behind and reach a consensus on the way forward and that 's our purpose today , " bush said to an audience that included representatives from european countries as well developing ones .
the us is the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases though experts believe china may soon surpass it .
" small step for mankind " however , the us president 's speech did n't convince many european officials who remained skeptical that the conference hosted by bush at the state department would help key un climate talks in bali in december .
the bali talks will aim to launch a successor to the kyoto protocol which sets limits on industrial nations ' emissions and which expires in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was not in a conciliatory mood " this here was a great step for the americans and a small step for mankind , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told journalists in washington .
" in substance , we are still far apart . "
bush 's emphasis on voluntary approaches rather than the firm targets pushed by many european countries also raised a few eyebrows .
a long-term goal for reducing global warming was needed , bush said , but added that " each nation will design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this . "
" one of the striking features of this meeting is how isolated this administration has become .
there is absolutely no support that i can see in the international community that we can drive this effort on the basis of voluntary efforts , " john ashton , a special representative on climate change for the british foreign secretary , said in an interview . " i do n't think that this meeting by itself moves the ball very much at all .
the much more significant meeting this week was at the un where there was a sense of urgency . "
criticism at odds with merkel 's statements bush 's proposal to expand nuclear energy to fight climate change and his statement that carbon dioxide emissions would be much higher today if it were n't for the 439 nuclear power plants worldwide was sharply criticised by germany 's gabriel .
" i do n't it 's particularly clever to give the world the message : build new nuclear plants , " gabriel said .
" first you urge people to expand nuclear energy and then you send in nato to bomb the nuclear power plants because they did the wrong thing - that is n't particularly intelligent politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was full of praise for bush 's initiative on climate change gabriel 's combativeness is in sharp contrast to chancellor angela merkel 's statements on us climate policy .
earlier this week at the sidelines of the un assembly in new york , merkel welcomed bush 's invitation to the world 's 16 worst polluters for climate talks .

in january , a squabble between russia and belarus temporarily disrupted supplies headed towards western europe and past disputes over gas with ukraine have had similar consequences .
the belarus disruption convinced european politicians they needed to develop a new and united energy strategy that would help overcome the bloc 's members ' worries about sovereignty issues .
on wednesday , sept .
26 , the european parliament passed a resolution approving a special representative who will be tasked with negotiating energy issues with provider countries such as russia .
speaking with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing many interests this so-called " mr. energy , " as eu politicians have referred to the new delegate , will represent the common interests of europe and give the 27-member bloc a united front in dealing with exporters .
additionally , " mr. energy " will work to prevent a future crisis which could be caused , for example , by a long-term disruption in russian gas or oil .
in the case of a supply shortfall , the representative would develop an internal eu solidarity mechanism .
polish christian democrat jacek saryusz-wolski , currently head of the eu foreign affairs committee , authored the resolution .

those details are on the mind of ferran tarradellas espuny , spokesman for energy commissioner andris piebalgs about parliamentary resolution .
" mr. energy " needs his responsibilities to be clearly outlined , which is missing from the current proposal , tarradellas espuny said . whether the energy representative should focus on gas or oil prices , the role of diversification of energy sources and what to do if a crisis occurs , were among the issues tarradellas espuny said still needed to be addressed .
poland wants energy solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connected and coordinated : europe 's future energy regime poland was a vocal proponent of including a solidarity clause in the eu legislation .
the country depends on russian gas and oil for about 90 percent of its energy imports and also serves as transit country for energy headed further west .
a solidarity clause would help poland in case of an interruption in its supply from russia .
but poland has been criticized for pushing energy solidarity while remaining opposed to other eu initiatives , such as the current attempt to reform the eu charter and its past opposition to the eu negotiating energy issues with russia over domestic trade issues .
diversification remains fundamental bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe looks towards sun and wind alternatives europe has realized it needs to diversify .
officials have called for both increasing the use of alternative energies , including such as solar and wind energy , as well as finding new sources for oil and gas .
norway and algeria are among the eu 's current favorites .
norway currently provides about 15 percent of the eu 's oil requirements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.09.2007 landmark ruling upholds germans ' right to clean air großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local authorities could be made to divert , reduce or even ban traffic from some areas a landmark case upholding the citizen 's right to non-polluted air could lead to local governments in germany being held responsible for the health of their constituents and the cleanliness of their immediate environment . germany 's federal administrative court on thursday , sept .
27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .
the eu passed a law which set a safe and acceptable level of air pollution for all member states in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : councils could pay for treatment of pollution-related illnesses the federal ministry of the environment and other conservation organizations praised the ruling .
" with this decision , the high quality of german air , in principle , is assured , " matthias machnig , the government 's assistant environment secretary , said in berlin .
jürgen resch , the chief of the german environmental help agency , called the decision " a breakthrough in the fight against air pollution . "
more bad news for automotive industry ?
meanwhile richard mergner of the alliance for nature conservation in bavaria said that he expected the court 's decision to have a knock-on effect in the german automotive industry .
german carmakers already face a potential new eu law which would require new cars to have average co2 emissions of 120 grams per kilometer .
german carmakers are expected to be hit especially hard by the new regulation : producers of luxury vehicles , such as porsche , daimler , bmw and audi , far exceed the emissions target and lag behind when it comes to hybrid technology that 's been pushed by companies such as toyota and honda .
a nationwide spate of cases against local authorities over the quality of air may force the german government to take its own action against polluters to avoid a slide into environmental litigiousness . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .
the eu passed a law which set a safe and acceptable level of air pollution for all member states in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : councils could pay for treatment of pollution-related illnesses the federal ministry of the environment and other conservation organizations praised the ruling .
" with this decision , the high quality of german air , in principle , is assured , " matthias machnig , the government 's assistant environment secretary , said in berlin .
jürgen resch , the chief of the german environmental help agency , called the decision " a breakthrough in the fight against air pollution . "

" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .
the eu passed a law which set a safe and acceptable level of air pollution for all member states in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : councils could pay for treatment of pollution-related illnesses the federal ministry of the environment and other conservation organizations praised the ruling .
" with this decision , the high quality of german air , in principle , is assured , " matthias machnig , the government 's assistant environment secretary , said in berlin .
jürgen resch , the chief of the german environmental help agency , called the decision " a breakthrough in the fight against air pollution . "
more bad news for automotive industry ?
meanwhile richard mergner of the alliance for nature conservation in bavaria said that he expected the court 's decision to have a knock-on effect in the german automotive industry .
german carmakers already face a potential new eu law which would require new cars to have average co2 emissions of 120 grams per kilometer .
german carmakers are expected to be hit especially hard by the new regulation : producers of luxury vehicles , such as porsche , daimler , bmw and audi , far exceed the emissions target and lag behind when it comes to hybrid technology that 's been pushed by companies such as toyota and honda .
a nationwide spate of cases against local authorities over the quality of air may force the german government to take its own action against polluters to avoid a slide into environmental litigiousness . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the first case of its kind in germany , a man went on trial this week in the northern city of celle for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists . the 36-year-old iraqi-born kurdish defendant , known as ibrahim r. , is accused of using the internet as a " terror weapon " and conducting his own " personal jihad on the computer .

" " virtual supermarket for terrorists " federal prosecutors said the defendant , who was arrested last october and has been jailed pending trial ever since , spent hours surfing the internet and logged on in the chatroom under seven different pseudonyms . the audio and video files he downloaded from the internet and posted in the chatroom contained messages by bin laden and abu musab al-sarkawi , the now dead leader of al qaeda in iraq , and include the justification of terrorist attacks and incitement of hatred against jews .
the defendant himself occasionally appealed for participation in jihad , or holy war , prosecutors added . the case , experts say , underscores the increasing significance of the role of the internet in global terrorism .

" this is about distributing speeches online by members of terrorist groups , and not something like building bombs , buying a ticket to pakistan or funding radical groups , " rüther said , adding there was a difference between general propaganda for al qaeda and targeted recruiting of members and supporters . some of the speeches by bin laden were broadcast on the arab tv network al jazeera he said , adding that anyone could have seen them if they wanted to . downloading such video clips and passing them on to others is legal in germany , rüther said , adding that the case risked putting the german justice system on a slippery slope that could lead to " criminal law being broadened to cover laws on political convictions .

" in the first case of its kind in germany , a man went on trial this week in the northern city of celle for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists . the 36-year-old iraqi-born kurdish defendant , known as ibrahim r. , is accused of using the internet as a " terror weapon " and conducting his own " personal jihad on the computer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials observed the defendant 's internet habits for 18 months the defendant , who was under observation by security officials for a year and a half , also faces charges of attempting to recruit members and supporters for two terrorist networks , al qaeda and " al qaeda in iraq . " peter ernst , the main prosecutor in the case , said the " main propaganda path for al qaeda is the internet , where jihad is also carried out virtually . " " virtual supermarket for terrorists " federal prosecutors said the defendant , who was arrested last october and has been jailed pending trial ever since , spent hours surfing the internet and logged on in the chatroom under seven different pseudonyms . the audio and video files he downloaded from the internet and posted in the chatroom contained messages by bin laden and abu musab al-sarkawi , the now dead leader of al qaeda in iraq , and include the justification of terrorist attacks and incitement of hatred against jews .
the defendant himself occasionally appealed for participation in jihad , or holy war , prosecutors added . the case , experts say , underscores the increasing significance of the role of the internet in global terrorism .
known to offer everything from sources of terror financing , the sale of chemicals and fertilizers , recruitment of members , to a complete terrorist attack how-to guide , monitoring the web has long been high on counter-terrorism experts ' list . " this trial is a milestone in terms of fighting terrorism on the internet and will be watched closely , " said rolf tophoven , director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and security policy .
" the internet today has become a virtual supermarket for terrorists , where they can find everything they need to prepare for attacks . " new legal ground ? yet , the " cyber jihadist " case also raises questions about what constitutes terrorism , and reflects germany 's struggle to deal with new threats with the right legal tools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the sept .
11 suicide pilots , including mohammed atta , had lived in hamburg germany first toughened its anti-terror laws after it emerged that three of the sept .
11 , 2001 , suicide pilots had lived in hamburg .
it started by , among other things , making membership in a foreign terror group a crime .
more recently , the foiling of potentially deadly bombings has german politicians pushing for stricter anti-terror legislation to criminalize training for an attack or obtaining weapons or other substances in order to carry out an attack . but the present case in celle covers new legal ground , according to klaus rüther , ibrahim r. 's lawyer , because the defendant is solely charged with actions on the internet . " this is about distributing speeches online by members of terrorist groups , and not something like building bombs , buying a ticket to pakistan or funding radical groups , " rüther said , adding there was a difference between general propaganda for al qaeda and targeted recruiting of members and supporters . some of the speeches by bin laden were broadcast on the arab tv network al jazeera he said , adding that anyone could have seen them if they wanted to . downloading such video clips and passing them on to others is legal in germany , rüther said , adding that the case risked putting the german justice system on a slippery slope that could lead to " criminal law being broadened to cover laws on political convictions . " hard to make a case experts agree that prosecutors will have a tough time making a case , because they will have to prove that ibrahim r. had intentions to plan attacks or recruit new members for al qaeda through the online distribution of hate material and terrorist propaganda . " did the defendant do more than simply view bin laden recordings and pass them on ?
why did he do it ? " asked tophoven .
" that will be the decisive point in the trial . " bernd carstensen , press spokesman for germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- pointed out that merely sympathizing with terrorist groups was no longer a crime in germany . " simply distributing terrorist propaganda no longer suffices in germany for a prosecution , " carstensen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until 2003 , sporting a bin laden sticker would have been illegal in germany sympathizing with terror groups or distributing propaganda was made a punishable offence under section 129a of germany 's penal code in the 1970s , when attacks by groups like the red army faction sparked widespread terrorism fears across the country .
that included writings , pamphlets , posters , t-shirts that showed common cause with left-wing terrorist movements . but , in 2003 , the green party decriminalized it when they shared power with the social democrats in the federal government .
earlier this year , in keeping with the liberalized law , germany 's federal administrative court ruled that general calls for jihad were no longer punishable as propaganda for a terrorist group . a deterrent to " virtual jihad " " it 's an important trial because it will shed light on whether what happens in closed chat groups on the internet falls under freedom of expression or whether you can penalize it if there 's proof of planned attacks , " said carstensen . whatever the outcome of the " cyber jihadist " trial , some say it will set a precedent .
tophoven said the trial would be an important step in countering " virtual jihad . " " it will act as a deterrent for future internet users toying with the idea of playing terrorist . " the trial is expected to continue until january 2008 . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bernd carstensen , press spokesman for germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- pointed out that merely sympathizing with terrorist groups was no longer a crime in germany . " simply distributing terrorist propaganda no longer suffices in germany for a prosecution , " carstensen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until 2003 , sporting a bin laden sticker would have been illegal in germany sympathizing with terror groups or distributing propaganda was made a punishable offence under section 129a of germany 's penal code in the 1970s , when attacks by groups like the red army faction sparked widespread terrorism fears across the country .
that included writings , pamphlets , posters , t-shirts that showed common cause with left-wing terrorist movements . but , in 2003 , the green party decriminalized it when they shared power with the social democrats in the federal government .
earlier this year , in keeping with the liberalized law , germany 's federal administrative court ruled that general calls for jihad were no longer punishable as propaganda for a terrorist group . a deterrent to " virtual jihad " " it 's an important trial because it will shed light on whether what happens in closed chat groups on the internet falls under freedom of expression or whether you can penalize it if there 's proof of planned attacks , " said carstensen . whatever the outcome of the " cyber jihadist " trial , some say it will set a precedent .
tophoven said the trial would be an important step in countering " virtual jihad . " " it will act as a deterrent for future internet users toying with the idea of playing terrorist . " the trial is expected to continue until january 2008 . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

asian countries need to step forward and strongly condemn the regime , said dw 's klaus dahmann . pinning hopes on the united nations security council is often pointless .
once again , the council has left the impression that when its authority is needed the most , the highest un committee remains divided .
what sounds good on paper - the task of protecting world peace - has proved in practice to once again be a sham .
myanmar is the most recent example of this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dahmann during the cold war there were two great powers - the united states and the soviet union - which mutually blocked each other on principle .
nowadays , individual interests can water down toughly-worded draft resolutions .
the united states has on several occasions prevented a condemnation of israel 's use of force in the middle east .
russia 's support of serbia has pushed a solution to the future of kosovo far into the future .
and now it is china 's " no " that has stopped harsher action to be taken against the junta in myanmar .
the powerful 15-member council has too often proved to be a toothless tiger .
that has something to do with the fact that , with the end of the east-west conflict , the threat scenario has changed radically .
the former superpowers are no longer conducting proxy wars against each other in korea , vietnam or afghanistan .
instead , criminal power-hungry politicians who spark local wars , have taken their place .
the security council then duly notes that the un may not interfere with a country 's " internal affairs . "
that 's what china 's doing in myanmar - one really ca n't speak of a " threat to world peace , " a situation for which the un security council was created , says beijing .
and that is wrong .
the issue is no longer an " internal affair " when a regime , such as the one in myanmar , uses armed force against peaceful demonstrators , or when it arrests protesting citizens , or when it does not shy away from murder .
then it becomes an issue of defending basic human rights .
as the recent days have shown , doing nothing only encourages the generals to use still more force against the demonstrators .
those who should care the most about the crisis in myanmar - china and india - have long kept silent about these human rights violations .
china , with the olympics looming , should have every reason to want to present itself as a democratic " mr. clean " as does india , which prides itself on being the " world 's largest democracy . "
but china and india do n't want to endanger their economic interests in myanmar , a country rich in raw materials .
now , they have joined other association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- countries in finally issuing a statement on events in myanmar - but it comes late and is not enough .
it 's necessary to put more pressure on the junta in myanmar , pressure and the asean states chiefly must be the ones to apply it .
having a cruel , unjust regime in their neighbourhood is a latent risk that also threatens asean security .
and a democracy there would be a positive thing for their economic interests .
in the long run , asean and not the un must prove to be a functional organization in the myanmar case .

the security council then duly notes that the un may not interfere with a country 's " internal affairs . "
that 's what china 's doing in myanmar - one really ca n't speak of a " threat to world peace , " a situation for which the un security council was created , says beijing .
and that is wrong .
the issue is no longer an " internal affair " when a regime , such as the one in myanmar , uses armed force against peaceful demonstrators , or when it arrests protesting citizens , or when it does not shy away from murder .
then it becomes an issue of defending basic human rights .
as the recent days have shown , doing nothing only encourages the generals to use still more force against the demonstrators .
those who should care the most about the crisis in myanmar - china and india - have long kept silent about these human rights violations .
china , with the olympics looming , should have every reason to want to present itself as a democratic " mr. clean " as does india , which prides itself on being the " world 's largest democracy . "
but china and india do n't want to endanger their economic interests in myanmar , a country rich in raw materials .
now , they have joined other association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- countries in finally issuing a statement on events in myanmar - but it comes late and is not enough .
it 's necessary to put more pressure on the junta in myanmar , pressure and the asean states chiefly must be the ones to apply it .

asian countries need to step forward and strongly condemn the regime , said dw 's klaus dahmann . pinning hopes on the united nations security council is often pointless .
once again , the council has left the impression that when its authority is needed the most , the highest un committee remains divided .
what sounds good on paper - the task of protecting world peace - has proved in practice to once again be a sham .
myanmar is the most recent example of this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dahmann during the cold war there were two great powers - the united states and the soviet union - which mutually blocked each other on principle .
nowadays , individual interests can water down toughly-worded draft resolutions .
the united states has on several occasions prevented a condemnation of israel 's use of force in the middle east .
russia 's support of serbia has pushed a solution to the future of kosovo far into the future .
and now it is china 's " no " that has stopped harsher action to be taken against the junta in myanmar .
the powerful 15-member council has too often proved to be a toothless tiger .
that has something to do with the fact that , with the end of the east-west conflict , the threat scenario has changed radically .
the former superpowers are no longer conducting proxy wars against each other in korea , vietnam or afghanistan .
instead , criminal power-hungry politicians who spark local wars , have taken their place .
the security council then duly notes that the un may not interfere with a country 's " internal affairs . "
that 's what china 's doing in myanmar - one really ca n't speak of a " threat to world peace , " a situation for which the un security council was created , says beijing .

the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .
the plan also has the airline industry up in arms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are resisting following energy companies into joining europe 's carbon emissions trading scheme giovanni bisigani , director general and ceo of the geneva-based international air transport association or iata , which represents 250 airlines around the world , said the eu 's approach was " disappointing and irresponsible . "
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt airport is one of europe 's busiest the fees are not intended to raise the airport operators ' bottom-line , as revenue losses from airlines emitting the fewest emissions would be balanced by planes emitting more environmentally damaging nitrogen oxides .
the effect on ticket prices will depend on the airline , officials in berlin said .
companies operating older fleets may pass the higher fees on to customers while , ideally , the lower fees paid by airlines with more modern plane could lead to a drop in prices . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .
the eu passed a law which set a safe and acceptable level of air pollution for all member states in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : councils could pay for treatment of pollution-related illnesses the federal ministry of the environment and other conservation organizations praised the ruling .
" with this decision , the high quality of german air , in principle , is assured , " matthias machnig , the government 's assistant environment secretary , said in berlin .
jürgen resch , the chief of the german environmental help agency , called the decision " a breakthrough in the fight against air pollution . "
more bad news for automotive industry ?
meanwhile richard mergner of the alliance for nature conservation in bavaria said that he expected the court 's decision to have a knock-on effect in the german automotive industry .
german carmakers already face a potential new eu law which would require new cars to have average co2 emissions of 120 grams per kilometer .
german carmakers are expected to be hit especially hard by the new regulation : producers of luxury vehicles , such as porsche , daimler , bmw and audi , far exceed the emissions target and lag behind when it comes to hybrid technology that 's been pushed by companies such as toyota and honda .
a nationwide spate of cases against local authorities over the quality of air may force the german government to take its own action against polluters to avoid a slide into environmental litigiousness . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in january , a squabble between russia and belarus temporarily disrupted supplies headed towards western europe and past disputes over gas with ukraine have had similar consequences .
the belarus disruption convinced european politicians they needed to develop a new and united energy strategy that would help overcome the bloc 's members ' worries about sovereignty issues .
on wednesday , sept .
26 , the european parliament passed a resolution approving a special representative who will be tasked with negotiating energy issues with provider countries such as russia .
speaking with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing many interests this so-called " mr. energy , " as eu politicians have referred to the new delegate , will represent the common interests of europe and give the 27-member bloc a united front in dealing with exporters .
additionally , " mr. energy " will work to prevent a future crisis which could be caused , for example , by a long-term disruption in russian gas or oil .
in the case of a supply shortfall , the representative would develop an internal eu solidarity mechanism .
polish christian democrat jacek saryusz-wolski , currently head of the eu foreign affairs committee , authored the resolution .
a total of 553 parliamentarians voted for the idea while 103 voted against it and 27 abstained .
" this is a new starting point for a united foreign policy of the union , " saryusz-wolski said .

" we 've at last arrived at the implementation phase .
the basics have been clarified , now the question is the details . "
those details are on the mind of ferran tarradellas espuny , spokesman for energy commissioner andris piebalgs about parliamentary resolution .
" mr. energy " needs his responsibilities to be clearly outlined , which is missing from the current proposal , tarradellas espuny said . whether the energy representative should focus on gas or oil prices , the role of diversification of energy sources and what to do if a crisis occurs , were among the issues tarradellas espuny said still needed to be addressed .
poland wants energy solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connected and coordinated : europe 's future energy regime poland was a vocal proponent of including a solidarity clause in the eu legislation .
the country depends on russian gas and oil for about 90 percent of its energy imports and also serves as transit country for energy headed further west .
a solidarity clause would help poland in case of an interruption in its supply from russia .
but poland has been criticized for pushing energy solidarity while remaining opposed to other eu initiatives , such as the current attempt to reform the eu charter and its past opposition to the eu negotiating energy issues with russia over domestic trade issues .
diversification remains fundamental bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe looks towards sun and wind alternatives europe has realized it needs to diversify .
officials have called for both increasing the use of alternative energies , including such as solar and wind energy , as well as finding new sources for oil and gas .

norway currently provides about 15 percent of the eu 's oil requirements .

in the case of a supply shortfall , the representative would develop an internal eu solidarity mechanism .
polish christian democrat jacek saryusz-wolski , currently head of the eu foreign affairs committee , authored the resolution .
a total of 553 parliamentarians voted for the idea while 103 voted against it and 27 abstained .
" this is a new starting point for a united foreign policy of the union , " saryusz-wolski said .
no more baby steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to prevent shortages " the european energy policy is no longer in its infancy , " said kristina notz , an expert in energy policy for the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich .
" we 've at last arrived at the implementation phase .
the basics have been clarified , now the question is the details . "
those details are on the mind of ferran tarradellas espuny , spokesman for energy commissioner andris piebalgs about parliamentary resolution .
" mr. energy " needs his responsibilities to be clearly outlined , which is missing from the current proposal , tarradellas espuny said . whether the energy representative should focus on gas or oil prices , the role of diversification of energy sources and what to do if a crisis occurs , were among the issues tarradellas espuny said still needed to be addressed .
poland wants energy solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connected and coordinated : europe 's future energy regime poland was a vocal proponent of including a solidarity clause in the eu legislation .
the country depends on russian gas and oil for about 90 percent of its energy imports and also serves as transit country for energy headed further west .
a solidarity clause would help poland in case of an interruption in its supply from russia .
but poland has been criticized for pushing energy solidarity while remaining opposed to other eu initiatives , such as the current attempt to reform the eu charter and its past opposition to the eu negotiating energy issues with russia over domestic trade issues .
diversification remains fundamental bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe looks towards sun and wind alternatives europe has realized it needs to diversify .
officials have called for both increasing the use of alternative energies , including such as solar and wind energy , as well as finding new sources for oil and gas .

28 , president bush called for a " strong and transparent " way for nations to measure progress on fighting climate change but said that each country should set its own approach .
bush also called for the creation of a new global fund that would help developing nations pay for clean-energy projects .
the conference was the first in a series of talks among major polluting nations that bush has called for .
" our nations have an opportunity to leave the debates of the past behind and reach a consensus on the way forward and that 's our purpose today , " bush said to an audience that included representatives from european countries as well developing ones .
the us is the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases though experts believe china may soon surpass it .
" small step for mankind " however , the us president 's speech did n't convince many european officials who remained skeptical that the conference hosted by bush at the state department would help key un climate talks in bali in december .
the bali talks will aim to launch a successor to the kyoto protocol which sets limits on industrial nations ' emissions and which expires in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was not in a conciliatory mood " this here was a great step for the americans and a small step for mankind , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told journalists in washington .
" in substance , we are still far apart . "
bush 's emphasis on voluntary approaches rather than the firm targets pushed by many european countries also raised a few eyebrows .
a long-term goal for reducing global warming was needed , bush said , but added that " each nation will design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this . "
" one of the striking features of this meeting is how isolated this administration has become .
there is absolutely no support that i can see in the international community that we can drive this effort on the basis of voluntary efforts , " john ashton , a special representative on climate change for the british foreign secretary , said in an interview . " i do n't think that this meeting by itself moves the ball very much at all .
the much more significant meeting this week was at the un where there was a sense of urgency . "
criticism at odds with merkel 's statements bush 's proposal to expand nuclear energy to fight climate change and his statement that carbon dioxide emissions would be much higher today if it were n't for the 439 nuclear power plants worldwide was sharply criticised by germany 's gabriel .
" i do n't it 's particularly clever to give the world the message : build new nuclear plants , " gabriel said .
" first you urge people to expand nuclear energy and then you send in nato to bomb the nuclear power plants because they did the wrong thing - that is n't particularly intelligent politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was full of praise for bush 's initiative on climate change gabriel 's combativeness is in sharp contrast to chancellor angela merkel 's statements on us climate policy .
earlier this week at the sidelines of the un assembly in new york , merkel welcomed bush 's invitation to the world 's 16 worst polluters for climate talks .
" i think it 's very important because it makes it clear that the americans are back in the climate process , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .
the plan also has the airline industry up in arms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are resisting following energy companies into joining europe 's carbon emissions trading scheme giovanni bisigani , director general and ceo of the geneva-based international air transport association or iata , which represents 250 airlines around the world , said the eu 's approach was " disappointing and irresponsible . "
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt airport is one of europe 's busiest the fees are not intended to raise the airport operators ' bottom-line , as revenue losses from airlines emitting the fewest emissions would be balanced by planes emitting more environmentally damaging nitrogen oxides .
the effect on ticket prices will depend on the airline , officials in berlin said .
companies operating older fleets may pass the higher fees on to customers while , ideally , the lower fees paid by airlines with more modern plane could lead to a drop in prices . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the first case of its kind in germany , a man went on trial this week in the northern city of celle for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists . the 36-year-old iraqi-born kurdish defendant , known as ibrahim r. , is accused of using the internet as a " terror weapon " and conducting his own " personal jihad on the computer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials observed the defendant 's internet habits for 18 months the defendant , who was under observation by security officials for a year and a half , also faces charges of attempting to recruit members and supporters for two terrorist networks , al qaeda and " al qaeda in iraq . " peter ernst , the main prosecutor in the case , said the " main propaganda path for al qaeda is the internet , where jihad is also carried out virtually . " " virtual supermarket for terrorists " federal prosecutors said the defendant , who was arrested last october and has been jailed pending trial ever since , spent hours surfing the internet and logged on in the chatroom under seven different pseudonyms . the audio and video files he downloaded from the internet and posted in the chatroom contained messages by bin laden and abu musab al-sarkawi , the now dead leader of al qaeda in iraq , and include the justification of terrorist attacks and incitement of hatred against jews .
the defendant himself occasionally appealed for participation in jihad , or holy war , prosecutors added . the case , experts say , underscores the increasing significance of the role of the internet in global terrorism .
known to offer everything from sources of terror financing , the sale of chemicals and fertilizers , recruitment of members , to a complete terrorist attack how-to guide , monitoring the web has long been high on counter-terrorism experts ' list . " this trial is a milestone in terms of fighting terrorism on the internet and will be watched closely , " said rolf tophoven , director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and security policy .
" the internet today has become a virtual supermarket for terrorists , where they can find everything they need to prepare for attacks . " new legal ground ? yet , the " cyber jihadist " case also raises questions about what constitutes terrorism , and reflects germany 's struggle to deal with new threats with the right legal tools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the sept .
11 suicide pilots , including mohammed atta , had lived in hamburg germany first toughened its anti-terror laws after it emerged that three of the sept .
11 , 2001 , suicide pilots had lived in hamburg .
it started by , among other things , making membership in a foreign terror group a crime .
more recently , the foiling of potentially deadly bombings has german politicians pushing for stricter anti-terror legislation to criminalize training for an attack or obtaining weapons or other substances in order to carry out an attack . but the present case in celle covers new legal ground , according to klaus rüther , ibrahim r. 's lawyer , because the defendant is solely charged with actions on the internet . " this is about distributing speeches online by members of terrorist groups , and not something like building bombs , buying a ticket to pakistan or funding radical groups , " rüther said , adding there was a difference between general propaganda for al qaeda and targeted recruiting of members and supporters . some of the speeches by bin laden were broadcast on the arab tv network al jazeera he said , adding that anyone could have seen them if they wanted to . downloading such video clips and passing them on to others is legal in germany , rüther said , adding that the case risked putting the german justice system on a slippery slope that could lead to " criminal law being broadened to cover laws on political convictions . " hard to make a case experts agree that prosecutors will have a tough time making a case , because they will have to prove that ibrahim r. had intentions to plan attacks or recruit new members for al qaeda through the online distribution of hate material and terrorist propaganda . " did the defendant do more than simply view bin laden recordings and pass them on ?
why did he do it ? " asked tophoven .
" that will be the decisive point in the trial . " bernd carstensen , press spokesman for germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- pointed out that merely sympathizing with terrorist groups was no longer a crime in germany . " simply distributing terrorist propaganda no longer suffices in germany for a prosecution , " carstensen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until 2003 , sporting a bin laden sticker would have been illegal in germany sympathizing with terror groups or distributing propaganda was made a punishable offence under section 129a of germany 's penal code in the 1970s , when attacks by groups like the red army faction sparked widespread terrorism fears across the country .
that included writings , pamphlets , posters , t-shirts that showed common cause with left-wing terrorist movements . but , in 2003 , the green party decriminalized it when they shared power with the social democrats in the federal government .
earlier this year , in keeping with the liberalized law , germany 's federal administrative court ruled that general calls for jihad were no longer punishable as propaganda for a terrorist group . a deterrent to " virtual jihad " " it 's an important trial because it will shed light on whether what happens in closed chat groups on the internet falls under freedom of expression or whether you can penalize it if there 's proof of planned attacks , " said carstensen . whatever the outcome of the " cyber jihadist " trial , some say it will set a precedent .
tophoven said the trial would be an important step in countering " virtual jihad . " " it will act as a deterrent for future internet users toying with the idea of playing terrorist . " the trial is expected to continue until january 2008 . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that included writings , pamphlets , posters , t-shirts that showed common cause with left-wing terrorist movements . but , in 2003 , the green party decriminalized it when they shared power with the social democrats in the federal government .

" in the first case of its kind in germany , a man went on trial this week in the northern city of celle for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists . the 36-year-old iraqi-born kurdish defendant , known as ibrahim r. , is accused of using the internet as a " terror weapon " and conducting his own " personal jihad on the computer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials observed the defendant 's internet habits for 18 months the defendant , who was under observation by security officials for a year and a half , also faces charges of attempting to recruit members and supporters for two terrorist networks , al qaeda and " al qaeda in iraq . " peter ernst , the main prosecutor in the case , said the " main propaganda path for al qaeda is the internet , where jihad is also carried out virtually . " " virtual supermarket for terrorists " federal prosecutors said the defendant , who was arrested last october and has been jailed pending trial ever since , spent hours surfing the internet and logged on in the chatroom under seven different pseudonyms . the audio and video files he downloaded from the internet and posted in the chatroom contained messages by bin laden and abu musab al-sarkawi , the now dead leader of al qaeda in iraq , and include the justification of terrorist attacks and incitement of hatred against jews .
the defendant himself occasionally appealed for participation in jihad , or holy war , prosecutors added . the case , experts say , underscores the increasing significance of the role of the internet in global terrorism .
known to offer everything from sources of terror financing , the sale of chemicals and fertilizers , recruitment of members , to a complete terrorist attack how-to guide , monitoring the web has long been high on counter-terrorism experts ' list . " this trial is a milestone in terms of fighting terrorism on the internet and will be watched closely , " said rolf tophoven , director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and security policy .
" the internet today has become a virtual supermarket for terrorists , where they can find everything they need to prepare for attacks . " new legal ground ? yet , the " cyber jihadist " case also raises questions about what constitutes terrorism , and reflects germany 's struggle to deal with new threats with the right legal tools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the sept .
11 suicide pilots , including mohammed atta , had lived in hamburg germany first toughened its anti-terror laws after it emerged that three of the sept .
11 , 2001 , suicide pilots had lived in hamburg .
it started by , among other things , making membership in a foreign terror group a crime .
more recently , the foiling of potentially deadly bombings has german politicians pushing for stricter anti-terror legislation to criminalize training for an attack or obtaining weapons or other substances in order to carry out an attack . but the present case in celle covers new legal ground , according to klaus rüther , ibrahim r. 's lawyer , because the defendant is solely charged with actions on the internet . " this is about distributing speeches online by members of terrorist groups , and not something like building bombs , buying a ticket to pakistan or funding radical groups , " rüther said , adding there was a difference between general propaganda for al qaeda and targeted recruiting of members and supporters . some of the speeches by bin laden were broadcast on the arab tv network al jazeera he said , adding that anyone could have seen them if they wanted to . downloading such video clips and passing them on to others is legal in germany , rüther said , adding that the case risked putting the german justice system on a slippery slope that could lead to " criminal law being broadened to cover laws on political convictions .

in january , a squabble between russia and belarus temporarily disrupted supplies headed towards western europe and past disputes over gas with ukraine have had similar consequences .
the belarus disruption convinced european politicians they needed to develop a new and united energy strategy that would help overcome the bloc 's members ' worries about sovereignty issues .
on wednesday , sept .
26 , the european parliament passed a resolution approving a special representative who will be tasked with negotiating energy issues with provider countries such as russia .
speaking with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing many interests this so-called " mr. energy , " as eu politicians have referred to the new delegate , will represent the common interests of europe and give the 27-member bloc a united front in dealing with exporters .
additionally , " mr. energy " will work to prevent a future crisis which could be caused , for example , by a long-term disruption in russian gas or oil .
in the case of a supply shortfall , the representative would develop an internal eu solidarity mechanism .
polish christian democrat jacek saryusz-wolski , currently head of the eu foreign affairs committee , authored the resolution .
a total of 553 parliamentarians voted for the idea while 103 voted against it and 27 abstained .
" this is a new starting point for a united foreign policy of the union , " saryusz-wolski said .
no more baby steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to prevent shortages " the european energy policy is no longer in its infancy , " said kristina notz , an expert in energy policy for the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich .
" we 've at last arrived at the implementation phase .
the basics have been clarified , now the question is the details . "
those details are on the mind of ferran tarradellas espuny , spokesman for energy commissioner andris piebalgs about parliamentary resolution .
" mr. energy " needs his responsibilities to be clearly outlined , which is missing from the current proposal , tarradellas espuny said . whether the energy representative should focus on gas or oil prices , the role of diversification of energy sources and what to do if a crisis occurs , were among the issues tarradellas espuny said still needed to be addressed .
poland wants energy solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connected and coordinated : europe 's future energy regime poland was a vocal proponent of including a solidarity clause in the eu legislation .
the country depends on russian gas and oil for about 90 percent of its energy imports and also serves as transit country for energy headed further west .
a solidarity clause would help poland in case of an interruption in its supply from russia .
but poland has been criticized for pushing energy solidarity while remaining opposed to other eu initiatives , such as the current attempt to reform the eu charter and its past opposition to the eu negotiating energy issues with russia over domestic trade issues .
diversification remains fundamental bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe looks towards sun and wind alternatives europe has realized it needs to diversify .
officials have called for both increasing the use of alternative energies , including such as solar and wind energy , as well as finding new sources for oil and gas .
norway and algeria are among the eu 's current favorites .
norway currently provides about 15 percent of the eu 's oil requirements .
on thursday , the country announced it would increase its exports from 55 billion to 78 billion cubic meters -lrb- 72 billion to 102 billion cubic yards -rrb- in 2010 .

28 , president bush called for a " strong and transparent " way for nations to measure progress on fighting climate change but said that each country should set its own approach .
bush also called for the creation of a new global fund that would help developing nations pay for clean-energy projects .
the conference was the first in a series of talks among major polluting nations that bush has called for .
" our nations have an opportunity to leave the debates of the past behind and reach a consensus on the way forward and that 's our purpose today , " bush said to an audience that included representatives from european countries as well developing ones .
the us is the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases though experts believe china may soon surpass it .
" small step for mankind " however , the us president 's speech did n't convince many european officials who remained skeptical that the conference hosted by bush at the state department would help key un climate talks in bali in december .
the bali talks will aim to launch a successor to the kyoto protocol which sets limits on industrial nations ' emissions and which expires in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was not in a conciliatory mood " this here was a great step for the americans and a small step for mankind , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told journalists in washington .
" in substance , we are still far apart . "
bush 's emphasis on voluntary approaches rather than the firm targets pushed by many european countries also raised a few eyebrows .
a long-term goal for reducing global warming was needed , bush said , but added that " each nation will design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this . "
" one of the striking features of this meeting is how isolated this administration has become .
there is absolutely no support that i can see in the international community that we can drive this effort on the basis of voluntary efforts , " john ashton , a special representative on climate change for the british foreign secretary , said in an interview . " i do n't think that this meeting by itself moves the ball very much at all .
the much more significant meeting this week was at the un where there was a sense of urgency . "
criticism at odds with merkel 's statements bush 's proposal to expand nuclear energy to fight climate change and his statement that carbon dioxide emissions would be much higher today if it were n't for the 439 nuclear power plants worldwide was sharply criticised by germany 's gabriel .
" i do n't it 's particularly clever to give the world the message : build new nuclear plants , " gabriel said .
" first you urge people to expand nuclear energy and then you send in nato to bomb the nuclear power plants because they did the wrong thing - that is n't particularly intelligent politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was full of praise for bush 's initiative on climate change gabriel 's combativeness is in sharp contrast to chancellor angela merkel 's statements on us climate policy .
earlier this week at the sidelines of the un assembly in new york , merkel welcomed bush 's invitation to the world 's 16 worst polluters for climate talks .
" i think it 's very important because it makes it clear that the americans are back in the climate process , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 28.09.2007 opinion : asian countries need to stand up to myanmar 's junta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council issued a benign statement of concern over myanmar 's violent crackdown against peaceful protestors .
asian countries need to step forward and strongly condemn the regime , said dw 's klaus dahmann . pinning hopes on the united nations security council is often pointless .
once again , the council has left the impression that when its authority is needed the most , the highest un committee remains divided .
what sounds good on paper - the task of protecting world peace - has proved in practice to once again be a sham .
myanmar is the most recent example of this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dahmann during the cold war there were two great powers - the united states and the soviet union - which mutually blocked each other on principle .
nowadays , individual interests can water down toughly-worded draft resolutions .
the united states has on several occasions prevented a condemnation of israel 's use of force in the middle east .
russia 's support of serbia has pushed a solution to the future of kosovo far into the future .
and now it is china 's " no " that has stopped harsher action to be taken against the junta in myanmar .
the powerful 15-member council has too often proved to be a toothless tiger .
that has something to do with the fact that , with the end of the east-west conflict , the threat scenario has changed radically .
the former superpowers are no longer conducting proxy wars against each other in korea , vietnam or afghanistan .
instead , criminal power-hungry politicians who spark local wars , have taken their place .
the security council then duly notes that the un may not interfere with a country 's " internal affairs . "
that 's what china 's doing in myanmar - one really ca n't speak of a " threat to world peace , " a situation for which the un security council was created , says beijing .
and that is wrong .
the issue is no longer an " internal affair " when a regime , such as the one in myanmar , uses armed force against peaceful demonstrators , or when it arrests protesting citizens , or when it does not shy away from murder .
then it becomes an issue of defending basic human rights .
as the recent days have shown , doing nothing only encourages the generals to use still more force against the demonstrators .
those who should care the most about the crisis in myanmar - china and india - have long kept silent about these human rights violations .
china , with the olympics looming , should have every reason to want to present itself as a democratic " mr. clean " as does india , which prides itself on being the " world 's largest democracy . "
but china and india do n't want to endanger their economic interests in myanmar , a country rich in raw materials .
now , they have joined other association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- countries in finally issuing a statement on events in myanmar - but it comes late and is not enough .
it 's necessary to put more pressure on the junta in myanmar , pressure and the asean states chiefly must be the ones to apply it .
having a cruel , unjust regime in their neighbourhood is a latent risk that also threatens asean security .
and a democracy there would be a positive thing for their economic interests .
in the long run , asean and not the un must prove to be a functional organization in the myanmar case .

asian countries need to step forward and strongly condemn the regime , said dw 's klaus dahmann . pinning hopes on the united nations security council is often pointless .
once again , the council has left the impression that when its authority is needed the most , the highest un committee remains divided .
what sounds good on paper - the task of protecting world peace - has proved in practice to once again be a sham .
myanmar is the most recent example of this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dahmann during the cold war there were two great powers - the united states and the soviet union - which mutually blocked each other on principle .
nowadays , individual interests can water down toughly-worded draft resolutions .
the united states has on several occasions prevented a condemnation of israel 's use of force in the middle east .
russia 's support of serbia has pushed a solution to the future of kosovo far into the future .
and now it is china 's " no " that has stopped harsher action to be taken against the junta in myanmar .
the powerful 15-member council has too often proved to be a toothless tiger .
that has something to do with the fact that , with the end of the east-west conflict , the threat scenario has changed radically .
the former superpowers are no longer conducting proxy wars against each other in korea , vietnam or afghanistan .
instead , criminal power-hungry politicians who spark local wars , have taken their place .
the security council then duly notes that the un may not interfere with a country 's " internal affairs . "
that 's what china 's doing in myanmar - one really ca n't speak of a " threat to world peace , " a situation for which the un security council was created , says beijing .
and that is wrong .
the issue is no longer an " internal affair " when a regime , such as the one in myanmar , uses armed force against peaceful demonstrators , or when it arrests protesting citizens , or when it does not shy away from murder .
then it becomes an issue of defending basic human rights .
as the recent days have shown , doing nothing only encourages the generals to use still more force against the demonstrators .
those who should care the most about the crisis in myanmar - china and india - have long kept silent about these human rights violations .
china , with the olympics looming , should have every reason to want to present itself as a democratic " mr. clean " as does india , which prides itself on being the " world 's largest democracy . "
but china and india do n't want to endanger their economic interests in myanmar , a country rich in raw materials .
now , they have joined other association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- countries in finally issuing a statement on events in myanmar - but it comes late and is not enough .
it 's necessary to put more pressure on the junta in myanmar , pressure and the asean states chiefly must be the ones to apply it .
having a cruel , unjust regime in their neighbourhood is a latent risk that also threatens asean security .
and a democracy there would be a positive thing for their economic interests .
in the long run , asean and not the un must prove to be a functional organization in the myanmar case .

the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .
the plan also has the airline industry up in arms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are resisting following energy companies into joining europe 's carbon emissions trading scheme giovanni bisigani , director general and ceo of the geneva-based international air transport association or iata , which represents 250 airlines around the world , said the eu 's approach was " disappointing and irresponsible . "
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt airport is one of europe 's busiest the fees are not intended to raise the airport operators ' bottom-line , as revenue losses from airlines emitting the fewest emissions would be balanced by planes emitting more environmentally damaging nitrogen oxides .
the effect on ticket prices will depend on the airline , officials in berlin said .
companies operating older fleets may pass the higher fees on to customers while , ideally , the lower fees paid by airlines with more modern plane could lead to a drop in prices . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , president bush called for a " strong and transparent " way for nations to measure progress on fighting climate change but said that each country should set its own approach .
bush also called for the creation of a new global fund that would help developing nations pay for clean-energy projects .
the conference was the first in a series of talks among major polluting nations that bush has called for .
" our nations have an opportunity to leave the debates of the past behind and reach a consensus on the way forward and that 's our purpose today , " bush said to an audience that included representatives from european countries as well developing ones .
the us is the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases though experts believe china may soon surpass it .
" small step for mankind " however , the us president 's speech did n't convince many european officials who remained skeptical that the conference hosted by bush at the state department would help key un climate talks in bali in december .
the bali talks will aim to launch a successor to the kyoto protocol which sets limits on industrial nations ' emissions and which expires in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was not in a conciliatory mood " this here was a great step for the americans and a small step for mankind , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told journalists in washington .
" in substance , we are still far apart . "
bush 's emphasis on voluntary approaches rather than the firm targets pushed by many european countries also raised a few eyebrows .
a long-term goal for reducing global warming was needed , bush said , but added that " each nation will design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this . "
" one of the striking features of this meeting is how isolated this administration has become .
there is absolutely no support that i can see in the international community that we can drive this effort on the basis of voluntary efforts , " john ashton , a special representative on climate change for the british foreign secretary , said in an interview . " i do n't think that this meeting by itself moves the ball very much at all .
the much more significant meeting this week was at the un where there was a sense of urgency . "
criticism at odds with merkel 's statements bush 's proposal to expand nuclear energy to fight climate change and his statement that carbon dioxide emissions would be much higher today if it were n't for the 439 nuclear power plants worldwide was sharply criticised by germany 's gabriel .
" i do n't it 's particularly clever to give the world the message : build new nuclear plants , " gabriel said .
" first you urge people to expand nuclear energy and then you send in nato to bomb the nuclear power plants because they did the wrong thing - that is n't particularly intelligent politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was full of praise for bush 's initiative on climate change gabriel 's combativeness is in sharp contrast to chancellor angela merkel 's statements on us climate policy .
earlier this week at the sidelines of the un assembly in new york , merkel welcomed bush 's invitation to the world 's 16 worst polluters for climate talks .
" i think it 's very important because it makes it clear that the americans are back in the climate process , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .
the eu passed a law which set a safe and acceptable level of air pollution for all member states in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : councils could pay for treatment of pollution-related illnesses the federal ministry of the environment and other conservation organizations praised the ruling .
" with this decision , the high quality of german air , in principle , is assured , " matthias machnig , the government 's assistant environment secretary , said in berlin .
jürgen resch , the chief of the german environmental help agency , called the decision " a breakthrough in the fight against air pollution . "
more bad news for automotive industry ?
meanwhile richard mergner of the alliance for nature conservation in bavaria said that he expected the court 's decision to have a knock-on effect in the german automotive industry .
german carmakers already face a potential new eu law which would require new cars to have average co2 emissions of 120 grams per kilometer .

27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .
the eu passed a law which set a safe and acceptable level of air pollution for all member states in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : councils could pay for treatment of pollution-related illnesses the federal ministry of the environment and other conservation organizations praised the ruling .
" with this decision , the high quality of german air , in principle , is assured , " matthias machnig , the government 's assistant environment secretary , said in berlin .
jürgen resch , the chief of the german environmental help agency , called the decision " a breakthrough in the fight against air pollution . "
more bad news for automotive industry ?
meanwhile richard mergner of the alliance for nature conservation in bavaria said that he expected the court 's decision to have a knock-on effect in the german automotive industry .
german carmakers already face a potential new eu law which would require new cars to have average co2 emissions of 120 grams per kilometer .
german carmakers are expected to be hit especially hard by the new regulation : producers of luxury vehicles , such as porsche , daimler , bmw and audi , far exceed the emissions target and lag behind when it comes to hybrid technology that 's been pushed by companies such as toyota and honda .

" in the first case of its kind in germany , a man went on trial this week in the northern city of celle for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists . the 36-year-old iraqi-born kurdish defendant , known as ibrahim r. , is accused of using the internet as a " terror weapon " and conducting his own " personal jihad on the computer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials observed the defendant 's internet habits for 18 months the defendant , who was under observation by security officials for a year and a half , also faces charges of attempting to recruit members and supporters for two terrorist networks , al qaeda and " al qaeda in iraq . " peter ernst , the main prosecutor in the case , said the " main propaganda path for al qaeda is the internet , where jihad is also carried out virtually . " " virtual supermarket for terrorists " federal prosecutors said the defendant , who was arrested last october and has been jailed pending trial ever since , spent hours surfing the internet and logged on in the chatroom under seven different pseudonyms . the audio and video files he downloaded from the internet and posted in the chatroom contained messages by bin laden and abu musab al-sarkawi , the now dead leader of al qaeda in iraq , and include the justification of terrorist attacks and incitement of hatred against jews .
the defendant himself occasionally appealed for participation in jihad , or holy war , prosecutors added . the case , experts say , underscores the increasing significance of the role of the internet in global terrorism .
known to offer everything from sources of terror financing , the sale of chemicals and fertilizers , recruitment of members , to a complete terrorist attack how-to guide , monitoring the web has long been high on counter-terrorism experts ' list . " this trial is a milestone in terms of fighting terrorism on the internet and will be watched closely , " said rolf tophoven , director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and security policy .
" the internet today has become a virtual supermarket for terrorists , where they can find everything they need to prepare for attacks . " new legal ground ? yet , the " cyber jihadist " case also raises questions about what constitutes terrorism , and reflects germany 's struggle to deal with new threats with the right legal tools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the sept .

11 , 2001 , suicide pilots had lived in hamburg .
it started by , among other things , making membership in a foreign terror group a crime .
more recently , the foiling of potentially deadly bombings has german politicians pushing for stricter anti-terror legislation to criminalize training for an attack or obtaining weapons or other substances in order to carry out an attack . but the present case in celle covers new legal ground , according to klaus rüther , ibrahim r. 's lawyer , because the defendant is solely charged with actions on the internet . " this is about distributing speeches online by members of terrorist groups , and not something like building bombs , buying a ticket to pakistan or funding radical groups , " rüther said , adding there was a difference between general propaganda for al qaeda and targeted recruiting of members and supporters . some of the speeches by bin laden were broadcast on the arab tv network al jazeera he said , adding that anyone could have seen them if they wanted to . downloading such video clips and passing them on to others is legal in germany , rüther said , adding that the case risked putting the german justice system on a slippery slope that could lead to " criminal law being broadened to cover laws on political convictions . " hard to make a case experts agree that prosecutors will have a tough time making a case , because they will have to prove that ibrahim r. had intentions to plan attacks or recruit new members for al qaeda through the online distribution of hate material and terrorist propaganda . " did the defendant do more than simply view bin laden recordings and pass them on ?
why did he do it ? " asked tophoven .
" that will be the decisive point in the trial . " bernd carstensen , press spokesman for germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- pointed out that merely sympathizing with terrorist groups was no longer a crime in germany . " simply distributing terrorist propaganda no longer suffices in germany for a prosecution , " carstensen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until 2003 , sporting a bin laden sticker would have been illegal in germany sympathizing with terror groups or distributing propaganda was made a punishable offence under section 129a of germany 's penal code in the 1970s , when attacks by groups like the red army faction sparked widespread terrorism fears across the country .
that included writings , pamphlets , posters , t-shirts that showed common cause with left-wing terrorist movements . but , in 2003 , the green party decriminalized it when they shared power with the social democrats in the federal government .
earlier this year , in keeping with the liberalized law , germany 's federal administrative court ruled that general calls for jihad were no longer punishable as propaganda for a terrorist group . a deterrent to " virtual jihad " " it 's an important trial because it will shed light on whether what happens in closed chat groups on the internet falls under freedom of expression or whether you can penalize it if there 's proof of planned attacks , " said carstensen . whatever the outcome of the " cyber jihadist " trial , some say it will set a precedent .
tophoven said the trial would be an important step in countering " virtual jihad . " " it will act as a deterrent for future internet users toying with the idea of playing terrorist .

" in the first case of its kind in germany , a man went on trial this week in the northern city of celle for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists . the 36-year-old iraqi-born kurdish defendant , known as ibrahim r. , is accused of using the internet as a " terror weapon " and conducting his own " personal jihad on the computer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials observed the defendant 's internet habits for 18 months the defendant , who was under observation by security officials for a year and a half , also faces charges of attempting to recruit members and supporters for two terrorist networks , al qaeda and " al qaeda in iraq . " peter ernst , the main prosecutor in the case , said the " main propaganda path for al qaeda is the internet , where jihad is also carried out virtually . " " virtual supermarket for terrorists " federal prosecutors said the defendant , who was arrested last october and has been jailed pending trial ever since , spent hours surfing the internet and logged on in the chatroom under seven different pseudonyms . the audio and video files he downloaded from the internet and posted in the chatroom contained messages by bin laden and abu musab al-sarkawi , the now dead leader of al qaeda in iraq , and include the justification of terrorist attacks and incitement of hatred against jews .
the defendant himself occasionally appealed for participation in jihad , or holy war , prosecutors added . the case , experts say , underscores the increasing significance of the role of the internet in global terrorism .
known to offer everything from sources of terror financing , the sale of chemicals and fertilizers , recruitment of members , to a complete terrorist attack how-to guide , monitoring the web has long been high on counter-terrorism experts ' list . " this trial is a milestone in terms of fighting terrorism on the internet and will be watched closely , " said rolf tophoven , director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and security policy .
" the internet today has become a virtual supermarket for terrorists , where they can find everything they need to prepare for attacks . " new legal ground ? yet , the " cyber jihadist " case also raises questions about what constitutes terrorism , and reflects germany 's struggle to deal with new threats with the right legal tools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the sept .

11 , 2001 , suicide pilots had lived in hamburg .
it started by , among other things , making membership in a foreign terror group a crime .
more recently , the foiling of potentially deadly bombings has german politicians pushing for stricter anti-terror legislation to criminalize training for an attack or obtaining weapons or other substances in order to carry out an attack . but the present case in celle covers new legal ground , according to klaus rüther , ibrahim r. 's lawyer , because the defendant is solely charged with actions on the internet . " this is about distributing speeches online by members of terrorist groups , and not something like building bombs , buying a ticket to pakistan or funding radical groups , " rüther said , adding there was a difference between general propaganda for al qaeda and targeted recruiting of members and supporters . some of the speeches by bin laden were broadcast on the arab tv network al jazeera he said , adding that anyone could have seen them if they wanted to . downloading such video clips and passing them on to others is legal in germany , rüther said , adding that the case risked putting the german justice system on a slippery slope that could lead to " criminal law being broadened to cover laws on political convictions . " hard to make a case experts agree that prosecutors will have a tough time making a case , because they will have to prove that ibrahim r. had intentions to plan attacks or recruit new members for al qaeda through the online distribution of hate material and terrorist propaganda . " did the defendant do more than simply view bin laden recordings and pass them on ?
why did he do it ? " asked tophoven .
" that will be the decisive point in the trial . " bernd carstensen , press spokesman for germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- pointed out that merely sympathizing with terrorist groups was no longer a crime in germany .

what sounds good on paper - the task of protecting world peace - has proved in practice to once again be a sham .
myanmar is the most recent example of this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dahmann during the cold war there were two great powers - the united states and the soviet union - which mutually blocked each other on principle .
nowadays , individual interests can water down toughly-worded draft resolutions .
the united states has on several occasions prevented a condemnation of israel 's use of force in the middle east .
russia 's support of serbia has pushed a solution to the future of kosovo far into the future .
and now it is china 's " no " that has stopped harsher action to be taken against the junta in myanmar .
the powerful 15-member council has too often proved to be a toothless tiger .
that has something to do with the fact that , with the end of the east-west conflict , the threat scenario has changed radically .
the former superpowers are no longer conducting proxy wars against each other in korea , vietnam or afghanistan .
instead , criminal power-hungry politicians who spark local wars , have taken their place .
the security council then duly notes that the un may not interfere with a country 's " internal affairs . "
that 's what china 's doing in myanmar - one really ca n't speak of a " threat to world peace , " a situation for which the un security council was created , says beijing .
and that is wrong .
the issue is no longer an " internal affair " when a regime , such as the one in myanmar , uses armed force against peaceful demonstrators , or when it arrests protesting citizens , or when it does not shy away from murder .
then it becomes an issue of defending basic human rights .
as the recent days have shown , doing nothing only encourages the generals to use still more force against the demonstrators .
those who should care the most about the crisis in myanmar - china and india - have long kept silent about these human rights violations .
china , with the olympics looming , should have every reason to want to present itself as a democratic " mr. clean " as does india , which prides itself on being the " world 's largest democracy . "
but china and india do n't want to endanger their economic interests in myanmar , a country rich in raw materials .
now , they have joined other association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- countries in finally issuing a statement on events in myanmar - but it comes late and is not enough .
it 's necessary to put more pressure on the junta in myanmar , pressure and the asean states chiefly must be the ones to apply it .
having a cruel , unjust regime in their neighbourhood is a latent risk that also threatens asean security .
and a democracy there would be a positive thing for their economic interests .
in the long run , asean and not the un must prove to be a functional organization in the myanmar case .

the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .
the plan also has the airline industry up in arms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are resisting following energy companies into joining europe 's carbon emissions trading scheme giovanni bisigani , director general and ceo of the geneva-based international air transport association or iata , which represents 250 airlines around the world , said the eu 's approach was " disappointing and irresponsible . "
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt airport is one of europe 's busiest the fees are not intended to raise the airport operators ' bottom-line , as revenue losses from airlines emitting the fewest emissions would be balanced by planes emitting more environmentally damaging nitrogen oxides .
the effect on ticket prices will depend on the airline , officials in berlin said .
companies operating older fleets may pass the higher fees on to customers while , ideally , the lower fees paid by airlines with more modern plane could lead to a drop in prices . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .

"
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .

" in the first case of its kind in germany , a man went on trial this week in the northern city of celle for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists . the 36-year-old iraqi-born kurdish defendant , known as ibrahim r. , is accused of using the internet as a " terror weapon " and conducting his own " personal jihad on the computer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials observed the defendant 's internet habits for 18 months the defendant , who was under observation by security officials for a year and a half , also faces charges of attempting to recruit members and supporters for two terrorist networks , al qaeda and " al qaeda in iraq . " peter ernst , the main prosecutor in the case , said the " main propaganda path for al qaeda is the internet , where jihad is also carried out virtually . " " virtual supermarket for terrorists " federal prosecutors said the defendant , who was arrested last october and has been jailed pending trial ever since , spent hours surfing the internet and logged on in the chatroom under seven different pseudonyms . the audio and video files he downloaded from the internet and posted in the chatroom contained messages by bin laden and abu musab al-sarkawi , the now dead leader of al qaeda in iraq , and include the justification of terrorist attacks and incitement of hatred against jews .
the defendant himself occasionally appealed for participation in jihad , or holy war , prosecutors added . the case , experts say , underscores the increasing significance of the role of the internet in global terrorism .
known to offer everything from sources of terror financing , the sale of chemicals and fertilizers , recruitment of members , to a complete terrorist attack how-to guide , monitoring the web has long been high on counter-terrorism experts ' list . " this trial is a milestone in terms of fighting terrorism on the internet and will be watched closely , " said rolf tophoven , director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and security policy .
" the internet today has become a virtual supermarket for terrorists , where they can find everything they need to prepare for attacks . " new legal ground ? yet , the " cyber jihadist " case also raises questions about what constitutes terrorism , and reflects germany 's struggle to deal with new threats with the right legal tools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the sept .
11 suicide pilots , including mohammed atta , had lived in hamburg germany first toughened its anti-terror laws after it emerged that three of the sept .
11 , 2001 , suicide pilots had lived in hamburg .
it started by , among other things , making membership in a foreign terror group a crime .
more recently , the foiling of potentially deadly bombings has german politicians pushing for stricter anti-terror legislation to criminalize training for an attack or obtaining weapons or other substances in order to carry out an attack . but the present case in celle covers new legal ground , according to klaus rüther , ibrahim r. 's lawyer , because the defendant is solely charged with actions on the internet . " this is about distributing speeches online by members of terrorist groups , and not something like building bombs , buying a ticket to pakistan or funding radical groups , " rüther said , adding there was a difference between general propaganda for al qaeda and targeted recruiting of members and supporters . some of the speeches by bin laden were broadcast on the arab tv network al jazeera he said , adding that anyone could have seen them if they wanted to . downloading such video clips and passing them on to others is legal in germany , rüther said , adding that the case risked putting the german justice system on a slippery slope that could lead to " criminal law being broadened to cover laws on political convictions . " hard to make a case experts agree that prosecutors will have a tough time making a case , because they will have to prove that ibrahim r. had intentions to plan attacks or recruit new members for al qaeda through the online distribution of hate material and terrorist propaganda . " did the defendant do more than simply view bin laden recordings and pass them on ?
why did he do it ? " asked tophoven .
" that will be the decisive point in the trial . " bernd carstensen , press spokesman for germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- pointed out that merely sympathizing with terrorist groups was no longer a crime in germany . " simply distributing terrorist propaganda no longer suffices in germany for a prosecution , " carstensen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until 2003 , sporting a bin laden sticker would have been illegal in germany sympathizing with terror groups or distributing propaganda was made a punishable offence under section 129a of germany 's penal code in the 1970s , when attacks by groups like the red army faction sparked widespread terrorism fears across the country .
that included writings , pamphlets , posters , t-shirts that showed common cause with left-wing terrorist movements . but , in 2003 , the green party decriminalized it when they shared power with the social democrats in the federal government .
earlier this year , in keeping with the liberalized law , germany 's federal administrative court ruled that general calls for jihad were no longer punishable as propaganda for a terrorist group . a deterrent to " virtual jihad " " it 's an important trial because it will shed light on whether what happens in closed chat groups on the internet falls under freedom of expression or whether you can penalize it if there 's proof of planned attacks , " said carstensen . whatever the outcome of the " cyber jihadist " trial , some say it will set a precedent .
tophoven said the trial would be an important step in countering " virtual jihad . " " it will act as a deterrent for future internet users toying with the idea of playing terrorist . " the trial is expected to continue until january 2008 . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , president bush called for a " strong and transparent " way for nations to measure progress on fighting climate change but said that each country should set its own approach .
bush also called for the creation of a new global fund that would help developing nations pay for clean-energy projects .
the conference was the first in a series of talks among major polluting nations that bush has called for .
" our nations have an opportunity to leave the debates of the past behind and reach a consensus on the way forward and that 's our purpose today , " bush said to an audience that included representatives from european countries as well developing ones .
the us is the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases though experts believe china may soon surpass it .
" small step for mankind " however , the us president 's speech did n't convince many european officials who remained skeptical that the conference hosted by bush at the state department would help key un climate talks in bali in december .
the bali talks will aim to launch a successor to the kyoto protocol which sets limits on industrial nations ' emissions and which expires in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was not in a conciliatory mood " this here was a great step for the americans and a small step for mankind , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told journalists in washington .
" in substance , we are still far apart . "
bush 's emphasis on voluntary approaches rather than the firm targets pushed by many european countries also raised a few eyebrows .
a long-term goal for reducing global warming was needed , bush said , but added that " each nation will design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this . "
" one of the striking features of this meeting is how isolated this administration has become .
there is absolutely no support that i can see in the international community that we can drive this effort on the basis of voluntary efforts , " john ashton , a special representative on climate change for the british foreign secretary , said in an interview . " i do n't think that this meeting by itself moves the ball very much at all .
the much more significant meeting this week was at the un where there was a sense of urgency . "
criticism at odds with merkel 's statements bush 's proposal to expand nuclear energy to fight climate change and his statement that carbon dioxide emissions would be much higher today if it were n't for the 439 nuclear power plants worldwide was sharply criticised by germany 's gabriel .
" i do n't it 's particularly clever to give the world the message : build new nuclear plants , " gabriel said .
" first you urge people to expand nuclear energy and then you send in nato to bomb the nuclear power plants because they did the wrong thing - that is n't particularly intelligent politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was full of praise for bush 's initiative on climate change gabriel 's combativeness is in sharp contrast to chancellor angela merkel 's statements on us climate policy .
earlier this week at the sidelines of the un assembly in new york , merkel welcomed bush 's invitation to the world 's 16 worst polluters for climate talks .
" i think it 's very important because it makes it clear that the americans are back in the climate process , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 28.09.2007 " mr. energy " and the future of european energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is reliant on energy imports in a bid to protect itself from capricious oil providers , the european union announced it would establish a new energy strategist to coordinate a united approach to international energy issues . russian oil is flowing to europe unhindered these days , but , as europe has learned , the oil giant can at times be an unreliable supplier .
in january , a squabble between russia and belarus temporarily disrupted supplies headed towards western europe and past disputes over gas with ukraine have had similar consequences .
the belarus disruption convinced european politicians they needed to develop a new and united energy strategy that would help overcome the bloc 's members ' worries about sovereignty issues .
on wednesday , sept .
26 , the european parliament passed a resolution approving a special representative who will be tasked with negotiating energy issues with provider countries such as russia .
speaking with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing many interests this so-called " mr. energy , " as eu politicians have referred to the new delegate , will represent the common interests of europe and give the 27-member bloc a united front in dealing with exporters .
additionally , " mr. energy " will work to prevent a future crisis which could be caused , for example , by a long-term disruption in russian gas or oil .
in the case of a supply shortfall , the representative would develop an internal eu solidarity mechanism .
polish christian democrat jacek saryusz-wolski , currently head of the eu foreign affairs committee , authored the resolution .
a total of 553 parliamentarians voted for the idea while 103 voted against it and 27 abstained .
" this is a new starting point for a united foreign policy of the union , " saryusz-wolski said .
no more baby steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to prevent shortages " the european energy policy is no longer in its infancy , " said kristina notz , an expert in energy policy for the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich .
" we 've at last arrived at the implementation phase .
the basics have been clarified , now the question is the details . "
those details are on the mind of ferran tarradellas espuny , spokesman for energy commissioner andris piebalgs about parliamentary resolution .
" mr. energy " needs his responsibilities to be clearly outlined , which is missing from the current proposal , tarradellas espuny said . whether the energy representative should focus on gas or oil prices , the role of diversification of energy sources and what to do if a crisis occurs , were among the issues tarradellas espuny said still needed to be addressed .
poland wants energy solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connected and coordinated : europe 's future energy regime poland was a vocal proponent of including a solidarity clause in the eu legislation .
the country depends on russian gas and oil for about 90 percent of its energy imports and also serves as transit country for energy headed further west .
a solidarity clause would help poland in case of an interruption in its supply from russia .
but poland has been criticized for pushing energy solidarity while remaining opposed to other eu initiatives , such as the current attempt to reform the eu charter and its past opposition to the eu negotiating energy issues with russia over domestic trade issues .
diversification remains fundamental bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe looks towards sun and wind alternatives europe has realized it needs to diversify .
officials have called for both increasing the use of alternative energies , including such as solar and wind energy , as well as finding new sources for oil and gas .

the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .

"
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt airport is one of europe 's busiest the fees are not intended to raise the airport operators ' bottom-line , as revenue losses from airlines emitting the fewest emissions would be balanced by planes emitting more environmentally damaging nitrogen oxides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 28.09.2007 " mr. energy " and the future of european energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is reliant on energy imports in a bid to protect itself from capricious oil providers , the european union announced it would establish a new energy strategist to coordinate a united approach to international energy issues . russian oil is flowing to europe unhindered these days , but , as europe has learned , the oil giant can at times be an unreliable supplier .
in january , a squabble between russia and belarus temporarily disrupted supplies headed towards western europe and past disputes over gas with ukraine have had similar consequences .
the belarus disruption convinced european politicians they needed to develop a new and united energy strategy that would help overcome the bloc 's members ' worries about sovereignty issues .
on wednesday , sept .
26 , the european parliament passed a resolution approving a special representative who will be tasked with negotiating energy issues with provider countries such as russia .
speaking with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing many interests this so-called " mr. energy , " as eu politicians have referred to the new delegate , will represent the common interests of europe and give the 27-member bloc a united front in dealing with exporters .
additionally , " mr. energy " will work to prevent a future crisis which could be caused , for example , by a long-term disruption in russian gas or oil .
in the case of a supply shortfall , the representative would develop an internal eu solidarity mechanism .
polish christian democrat jacek saryusz-wolski , currently head of the eu foreign affairs committee , authored the resolution .
a total of 553 parliamentarians voted for the idea while 103 voted against it and 27 abstained .
" this is a new starting point for a united foreign policy of the union , " saryusz-wolski said .
no more baby steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to prevent shortages " the european energy policy is no longer in its infancy , " said kristina notz , an expert in energy policy for the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich .
" we 've at last arrived at the implementation phase .
the basics have been clarified , now the question is the details . "
those details are on the mind of ferran tarradellas espuny , spokesman for energy commissioner andris piebalgs about parliamentary resolution .
" mr. energy " needs his responsibilities to be clearly outlined , which is missing from the current proposal , tarradellas espuny said . whether the energy representative should focus on gas or oil prices , the role of diversification of energy sources and what to do if a crisis occurs , were among the issues tarradellas espuny said still needed to be addressed .
poland wants energy solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connected and coordinated : europe 's future energy regime poland was a vocal proponent of including a solidarity clause in the eu legislation .
the country depends on russian gas and oil for about 90 percent of its energy imports and also serves as transit country for energy headed further west .
a solidarity clause would help poland in case of an interruption in its supply from russia .
but poland has been criticized for pushing energy solidarity while remaining opposed to other eu initiatives , such as the current attempt to reform the eu charter and its past opposition to the eu negotiating energy issues with russia over domestic trade issues .
diversification remains fundamental bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe looks towards sun and wind alternatives europe has realized it needs to diversify .
officials have called for both increasing the use of alternative energies , including such as solar and wind energy , as well as finding new sources for oil and gas .
norway and algeria are among the eu 's current favorites .
norway currently provides about 15 percent of the eu 's oil requirements .
on thursday , the country announced it would increase its exports from 55 billion to 78 billion cubic meters -lrb- 72 billion to 102 billion cubic yards -rrb- in 2010 .

27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .
the eu passed a law which set a safe and acceptable level of air pollution for all member states in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : councils could pay for treatment of pollution-related illnesses the federal ministry of the environment and other conservation organizations praised the ruling .
" with this decision , the high quality of german air , in principle , is assured , " matthias machnig , the government 's assistant environment secretary , said in berlin .
jürgen resch , the chief of the german environmental help agency , called the decision " a breakthrough in the fight against air pollution . "
more bad news for automotive industry ?
meanwhile richard mergner of the alliance for nature conservation in bavaria said that he expected the court 's decision to have a knock-on effect in the german automotive industry .
german carmakers already face a potential new eu law which would require new cars to have average co2 emissions of 120 grams per kilometer .
german carmakers are expected to be hit especially hard by the new regulation : producers of luxury vehicles , such as porsche , daimler , bmw and audi , far exceed the emissions target and lag behind when it comes to hybrid technology that 's been pushed by companies such as toyota and honda .
a nationwide spate of cases against local authorities over the quality of air may force the german government to take its own action against polluters to avoid a slide into environmental litigiousness . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in january , a squabble between russia and belarus temporarily disrupted supplies headed towards western europe and past disputes over gas with ukraine have had similar consequences .
the belarus disruption convinced european politicians they needed to develop a new and united energy strategy that would help overcome the bloc 's members ' worries about sovereignty issues .
on wednesday , sept .
26 , the european parliament passed a resolution approving a special representative who will be tasked with negotiating energy issues with provider countries such as russia .
speaking with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing many interests this so-called " mr. energy , " as eu politicians have referred to the new delegate , will represent the common interests of europe and give the 27-member bloc a united front in dealing with exporters .
additionally , " mr. energy " will work to prevent a future crisis which could be caused , for example , by a long-term disruption in russian gas or oil .
in the case of a supply shortfall , the representative would develop an internal eu solidarity mechanism .
polish christian democrat jacek saryusz-wolski , currently head of the eu foreign affairs committee , authored the resolution .

those details are on the mind of ferran tarradellas espuny , spokesman for energy commissioner andris piebalgs about parliamentary resolution .
" mr. energy " needs his responsibilities to be clearly outlined , which is missing from the current proposal , tarradellas espuny said . whether the energy representative should focus on gas or oil prices , the role of diversification of energy sources and what to do if a crisis occurs , were among the issues tarradellas espuny said still needed to be addressed .

a solidarity clause would help poland in case of an interruption in its supply from russia .

28 , president bush called for a " strong and transparent " way for nations to measure progress on fighting climate change but said that each country should set its own approach .
bush also called for the creation of a new global fund that would help developing nations pay for clean-energy projects .
the conference was the first in a series of talks among major polluting nations that bush has called for .
" our nations have an opportunity to leave the debates of the past behind and reach a consensus on the way forward and that 's our purpose today , " bush said to an audience that included representatives from european countries as well developing ones .
the us is the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases though experts believe china may soon surpass it .
" small step for mankind " however , the us president 's speech did n't convince many european officials who remained skeptical that the conference hosted by bush at the state department would help key un climate talks in bali in december .

28 , president bush called for a " strong and transparent " way for nations to measure progress on fighting climate change but said that each country should set its own approach .
bush also called for the creation of a new global fund that would help developing nations pay for clean-energy projects .
the conference was the first in a series of talks among major polluting nations that bush has called for .
" our nations have an opportunity to leave the debates of the past behind and reach a consensus on the way forward and that 's our purpose today , " bush said to an audience that included representatives from european countries as well developing ones .
the us is the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases though experts believe china may soon surpass it .
" small step for mankind " however , the us president 's speech did n't convince many european officials who remained skeptical that the conference hosted by bush at the state department would help key un climate talks in bali in december .
the bali talks will aim to launch a successor to the kyoto protocol which sets limits on industrial nations ' emissions and which expires in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was not in a conciliatory mood " this here was a great step for the americans and a small step for mankind , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told journalists in washington .
" in substance , we are still far apart . "
bush 's emphasis on voluntary approaches rather than the firm targets pushed by many european countries also raised a few eyebrows .
a long-term goal for reducing global warming was needed , bush said , but added that " each nation will design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this . "
" one of the striking features of this meeting is how isolated this administration has become .
there is absolutely no support that i can see in the international community that we can drive this effort on the basis of voluntary efforts , " john ashton , a special representative on climate change for the british foreign secretary , said in an interview . " i do n't think that this meeting by itself moves the ball very much at all .
the much more significant meeting this week was at the un where there was a sense of urgency . "
criticism at odds with merkel 's statements bush 's proposal to expand nuclear energy to fight climate change and his statement that carbon dioxide emissions would be much higher today if it were n't for the 439 nuclear power plants worldwide was sharply criticised by germany 's gabriel .
" i do n't it 's particularly clever to give the world the message : build new nuclear plants , " gabriel said .
" first you urge people to expand nuclear energy and then you send in nato to bomb the nuclear power plants because they did the wrong thing - that is n't particularly intelligent politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was full of praise for bush 's initiative on climate change gabriel 's combativeness is in sharp contrast to chancellor angela merkel 's statements on us climate policy .
earlier this week at the sidelines of the un assembly in new york , merkel welcomed bush 's invitation to the world 's 16 worst polluters for climate talks .
" i think it 's very important because it makes it clear that the americans are back in the climate process , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .

27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .
the eu passed a law which set a safe and acceptable level of air pollution for all member states in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : councils could pay for treatment of pollution-related illnesses the federal ministry of the environment and other conservation organizations praised the ruling .
" with this decision , the high quality of german air , in principle , is assured , " matthias machnig , the government 's assistant environment secretary , said in berlin .
jürgen resch , the chief of the german environmental help agency , called the decision " a breakthrough in the fight against air pollution . "
more bad news for automotive industry ?
meanwhile richard mergner of the alliance for nature conservation in bavaria said that he expected the court 's decision to have a knock-on effect in the german automotive industry .
german carmakers already face a potential new eu law which would require new cars to have average co2 emissions of 120 grams per kilometer .
german carmakers are expected to be hit especially hard by the new regulation : producers of luxury vehicles , such as porsche , daimler , bmw and audi , far exceed the emissions target and lag behind when it comes to hybrid technology that 's been pushed by companies such as toyota and honda .
a nationwide spate of cases against local authorities over the quality of air may force the german government to take its own action against polluters to avoid a slide into environmental litigiousness . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 28.09.2007 opinion : asian countries need to stand up to myanmar 's junta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council issued a benign statement of concern over myanmar 's violent crackdown against peaceful protestors .
asian countries need to step forward and strongly condemn the regime , said dw 's klaus dahmann . pinning hopes on the united nations security council is often pointless .
once again , the council has left the impression that when its authority is needed the most , the highest un committee remains divided .
what sounds good on paper - the task of protecting world peace - has proved in practice to once again be a sham .
myanmar is the most recent example of this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dahmann during the cold war there were two great powers - the united states and the soviet union - which mutually blocked each other on principle .
nowadays , individual interests can water down toughly-worded draft resolutions .
the united states has on several occasions prevented a condemnation of israel 's use of force in the middle east .
russia 's support of serbia has pushed a solution to the future of kosovo far into the future .
and now it is china 's " no " that has stopped harsher action to be taken against the junta in myanmar .
the powerful 15-member council has too often proved to be a toothless tiger .
that has something to do with the fact that , with the end of the east-west conflict , the threat scenario has changed radically .
the former superpowers are no longer conducting proxy wars against each other in korea , vietnam or afghanistan .
instead , criminal power-hungry politicians who spark local wars , have taken their place .
the security council then duly notes that the un may not interfere with a country 's " internal affairs . "
that 's what china 's doing in myanmar - one really ca n't speak of a " threat to world peace , " a situation for which the un security council was created , says beijing .
and that is wrong .
the issue is no longer an " internal affair " when a regime , such as the one in myanmar , uses armed force against peaceful demonstrators , or when it arrests protesting citizens , or when it does not shy away from murder .
then it becomes an issue of defending basic human rights .
as the recent days have shown , doing nothing only encourages the generals to use still more force against the demonstrators .
those who should care the most about the crisis in myanmar - china and india - have long kept silent about these human rights violations .
china , with the olympics looming , should have every reason to want to present itself as a democratic " mr. clean " as does india , which prides itself on being the " world 's largest democracy . "
but china and india do n't want to endanger their economic interests in myanmar , a country rich in raw materials .
now , they have joined other association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- countries in finally issuing a statement on events in myanmar - but it comes late and is not enough .
it 's necessary to put more pressure on the junta in myanmar , pressure and the asean states chiefly must be the ones to apply it .
having a cruel , unjust regime in their neighbourhood is a latent risk that also threatens asean security .
and a democracy there would be a positive thing for their economic interests .
in the long run , asean and not the un must prove to be a functional organization in the myanmar case .

the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .
the plan also has the airline industry up in arms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are resisting following energy companies into joining europe 's carbon emissions trading scheme giovanni bisigani , director general and ceo of the geneva-based international air transport association or iata , which represents 250 airlines around the world , said the eu 's approach was " disappointing and irresponsible . "
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt airport is one of europe 's busiest the fees are not intended to raise the airport operators ' bottom-line , as revenue losses from airlines emitting the fewest emissions would be balanced by planes emitting more environmentally damaging nitrogen oxides .
the effect on ticket prices will depend on the airline , officials in berlin said .
companies operating older fleets may pass the higher fees on to customers while , ideally , the lower fees paid by airlines with more modern plane could lead to a drop in prices . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in january , a squabble between russia and belarus temporarily disrupted supplies headed towards western europe and past disputes over gas with ukraine have had similar consequences .
the belarus disruption convinced european politicians they needed to develop a new and united energy strategy that would help overcome the bloc 's members ' worries about sovereignty issues .
on wednesday , sept .
26 , the european parliament passed a resolution approving a special representative who will be tasked with negotiating energy issues with provider countries such as russia .
speaking with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing many interests this so-called " mr. energy , " as eu politicians have referred to the new delegate , will represent the common interests of europe and give the 27-member bloc a united front in dealing with exporters .
additionally , " mr. energy " will work to prevent a future crisis which could be caused , for example , by a long-term disruption in russian gas or oil .
in the case of a supply shortfall , the representative would develop an internal eu solidarity mechanism .
polish christian democrat jacek saryusz-wolski , currently head of the eu foreign affairs committee , authored the resolution .
a total of 553 parliamentarians voted for the idea while 103 voted against it and 27 abstained .
" this is a new starting point for a united foreign policy of the union , " saryusz-wolski said .
no more baby steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to prevent shortages " the european energy policy is no longer in its infancy , " said kristina notz , an expert in energy policy for the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich .
" we 've at last arrived at the implementation phase .
the basics have been clarified , now the question is the details . "
those details are on the mind of ferran tarradellas espuny , spokesman for energy commissioner andris piebalgs about parliamentary resolution .
" mr. energy " needs his responsibilities to be clearly outlined , which is missing from the current proposal , tarradellas espuny said . whether the energy representative should focus on gas or oil prices , the role of diversification of energy sources and what to do if a crisis occurs , were among the issues tarradellas espuny said still needed to be addressed .
poland wants energy solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connected and coordinated : europe 's future energy regime poland was a vocal proponent of including a solidarity clause in the eu legislation .
the country depends on russian gas and oil for about 90 percent of its energy imports and also serves as transit country for energy headed further west .
a solidarity clause would help poland in case of an interruption in its supply from russia .
but poland has been criticized for pushing energy solidarity while remaining opposed to other eu initiatives , such as the current attempt to reform the eu charter and its past opposition to the eu negotiating energy issues with russia over domestic trade issues .
diversification remains fundamental bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe looks towards sun and wind alternatives europe has realized it needs to diversify .
officials have called for both increasing the use of alternative energies , including such as solar and wind energy , as well as finding new sources for oil and gas .
norway and algeria are among the eu 's current favorites .
norway currently provides about 15 percent of the eu 's oil requirements .
on thursday , the country announced it would increase its exports from 55 billion to 78 billion cubic meters -lrb- 72 billion to 102 billion cubic yards -rrb- in 2010 .

in january , a squabble between russia and belarus temporarily disrupted supplies headed towards western europe and past disputes over gas with ukraine have had similar consequences .
the belarus disruption convinced european politicians they needed to develop a new and united energy strategy that would help overcome the bloc 's members ' worries about sovereignty issues .
on wednesday , sept .

speaking with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing many interests this so-called " mr. energy , " as eu politicians have referred to the new delegate , will represent the common interests of europe and give the 27-member bloc a united front in dealing with exporters .

in the case of a supply shortfall , the representative would develop an internal eu solidarity mechanism .
polish christian democrat jacek saryusz-wolski , currently head of the eu foreign affairs committee , authored the resolution .

those details are on the mind of ferran tarradellas espuny , spokesman for energy commissioner andris piebalgs about parliamentary resolution .
" mr. energy " needs his responsibilities to be clearly outlined , which is missing from the current proposal , tarradellas espuny said . whether the energy representative should focus on gas or oil prices , the role of diversification of energy sources and what to do if a crisis occurs , were among the issues tarradellas espuny said still needed to be addressed .

" in the first case of its kind in germany , a man went on trial this week in the northern city of celle for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists . the 36-year-old iraqi-born kurdish defendant , known as ibrahim r. , is accused of using the internet as a " terror weapon " and conducting his own " personal jihad on the computer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials observed the defendant 's internet habits for 18 months the defendant , who was under observation by security officials for a year and a half , also faces charges of attempting to recruit members and supporters for two terrorist networks , al qaeda and " al qaeda in iraq . " peter ernst , the main prosecutor in the case , said the " main propaganda path for al qaeda is the internet , where jihad is also carried out virtually . " " virtual supermarket for terrorists " federal prosecutors said the defendant , who was arrested last october and has been jailed pending trial ever since , spent hours surfing the internet and logged on in the chatroom under seven different pseudonyms . the audio and video files he downloaded from the internet and posted in the chatroom contained messages by bin laden and abu musab al-sarkawi , the now dead leader of al qaeda in iraq , and include the justification of terrorist attacks and incitement of hatred against jews .
the defendant himself occasionally appealed for participation in jihad , or holy war , prosecutors added . the case , experts say , underscores the increasing significance of the role of the internet in global terrorism .
known to offer everything from sources of terror financing , the sale of chemicals and fertilizers , recruitment of members , to a complete terrorist attack how-to guide , monitoring the web has long been high on counter-terrorism experts ' list . " this trial is a milestone in terms of fighting terrorism on the internet and will be watched closely , " said rolf tophoven , director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and security policy .
" the internet today has become a virtual supermarket for terrorists , where they can find everything they need to prepare for attacks . " new legal ground ? yet , the " cyber jihadist " case also raises questions about what constitutes terrorism , and reflects germany 's struggle to deal with new threats with the right legal tools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the sept .
11 suicide pilots , including mohammed atta , had lived in hamburg germany first toughened its anti-terror laws after it emerged that three of the sept .
11 , 2001 , suicide pilots had lived in hamburg .
it started by , among other things , making membership in a foreign terror group a crime .
more recently , the foiling of potentially deadly bombings has german politicians pushing for stricter anti-terror legislation to criminalize training for an attack or obtaining weapons or other substances in order to carry out an attack . but the present case in celle covers new legal ground , according to klaus rüther , ibrahim r. 's lawyer , because the defendant is solely charged with actions on the internet . " this is about distributing speeches online by members of terrorist groups , and not something like building bombs , buying a ticket to pakistan or funding radical groups , " rüther said , adding there was a difference between general propaganda for al qaeda and targeted recruiting of members and supporters . some of the speeches by bin laden were broadcast on the arab tv network al jazeera he said , adding that anyone could have seen them if they wanted to . downloading such video clips and passing them on to others is legal in germany , rüther said , adding that the case risked putting the german justice system on a slippery slope that could lead to " criminal law being broadened to cover laws on political convictions . " hard to make a case experts agree that prosecutors will have a tough time making a case , because they will have to prove that ibrahim r. had intentions to plan attacks or recruit new members for al qaeda through the online distribution of hate material and terrorist propaganda . " did the defendant do more than simply view bin laden recordings and pass them on ?
why did he do it ? " asked tophoven .
" that will be the decisive point in the trial . " bernd carstensen , press spokesman for germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- pointed out that merely sympathizing with terrorist groups was no longer a crime in germany . " simply distributing terrorist propaganda no longer suffices in germany for a prosecution , " carstensen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until 2003 , sporting a bin laden sticker would have been illegal in germany sympathizing with terror groups or distributing propaganda was made a punishable offence under section 129a of germany 's penal code in the 1970s , when attacks by groups like the red army faction sparked widespread terrorism fears across the country .
that included writings , pamphlets , posters , t-shirts that showed common cause with left-wing terrorist movements . but , in 2003 , the green party decriminalized it when they shared power with the social democrats in the federal government .
earlier this year , in keeping with the liberalized law , germany 's federal administrative court ruled that general calls for jihad were no longer punishable as propaganda for a terrorist group . a deterrent to " virtual jihad " " it 's an important trial because it will shed light on whether what happens in closed chat groups on the internet falls under freedom of expression or whether you can penalize it if there 's proof of planned attacks , " said carstensen . whatever the outcome of the " cyber jihadist " trial , some say it will set a precedent .
tophoven said the trial would be an important step in countering " virtual jihad . " " it will act as a deterrent for future internet users toying with the idea of playing terrorist .

" in the first case of its kind in germany , a man went on trial this week in the northern city of celle for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists . the 36-year-old iraqi-born kurdish defendant , known as ibrahim r. , is accused of using the internet as a " terror weapon " and conducting his own " personal jihad on the computer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials observed the defendant 's internet habits for 18 months the defendant , who was under observation by security officials for a year and a half , also faces charges of attempting to recruit members and supporters for two terrorist networks , al qaeda and " al qaeda in iraq . " peter ernst , the main prosecutor in the case , said the " main propaganda path for al qaeda is the internet , where jihad is also carried out virtually . " " virtual supermarket for terrorists " federal prosecutors said the defendant , who was arrested last october and has been jailed pending trial ever since , spent hours surfing the internet and logged on in the chatroom under seven different pseudonyms . the audio and video files he downloaded from the internet and posted in the chatroom contained messages by bin laden and abu musab al-sarkawi , the now dead leader of al qaeda in iraq , and include the justification of terrorist attacks and incitement of hatred against jews .
the defendant himself occasionally appealed for participation in jihad , or holy war , prosecutors added . the case , experts say , underscores the increasing significance of the role of the internet in global terrorism .
known to offer everything from sources of terror financing , the sale of chemicals and fertilizers , recruitment of members , to a complete terrorist attack how-to guide , monitoring the web has long been high on counter-terrorism experts ' list . " this trial is a milestone in terms of fighting terrorism on the internet and will be watched closely , " said rolf tophoven , director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and security policy .
" the internet today has become a virtual supermarket for terrorists , where they can find everything they need to prepare for attacks . " new legal ground ? yet , the " cyber jihadist " case also raises questions about what constitutes terrorism , and reflects germany 's struggle to deal with new threats with the right legal tools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the sept .
11 suicide pilots , including mohammed atta , had lived in hamburg germany first toughened its anti-terror laws after it emerged that three of the sept .
11 , 2001 , suicide pilots had lived in hamburg .
it started by , among other things , making membership in a foreign terror group a crime .
more recently , the foiling of potentially deadly bombings has german politicians pushing for stricter anti-terror legislation to criminalize training for an attack or obtaining weapons or other substances in order to carry out an attack . but the present case in celle covers new legal ground , according to klaus rüther , ibrahim r. 's lawyer , because the defendant is solely charged with actions on the internet . " this is about distributing speeches online by members of terrorist groups , and not something like building bombs , buying a ticket to pakistan or funding radical groups , " rüther said , adding there was a difference between general propaganda for al qaeda and targeted recruiting of members and supporters . some of the speeches by bin laden were broadcast on the arab tv network al jazeera he said , adding that anyone could have seen them if they wanted to . downloading such video clips and passing them on to others is legal in germany , rüther said , adding that the case risked putting the german justice system on a slippery slope that could lead to " criminal law being broadened to cover laws on political convictions . " hard to make a case experts agree that prosecutors will have a tough time making a case , because they will have to prove that ibrahim r. had intentions to plan attacks or recruit new members for al qaeda through the online distribution of hate material and terrorist propaganda . " did the defendant do more than simply view bin laden recordings and pass them on ?
why did he do it ? " asked tophoven .
" that will be the decisive point in the trial . " bernd carstensen , press spokesman for germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- pointed out that merely sympathizing with terrorist groups was no longer a crime in germany . " simply distributing terrorist propaganda no longer suffices in germany for a prosecution , " carstensen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until 2003 , sporting a bin laden sticker would have been illegal in germany sympathizing with terror groups or distributing propaganda was made a punishable offence under section 129a of germany 's penal code in the 1970s , when attacks by groups like the red army faction sparked widespread terrorism fears across the country .
that included writings , pamphlets , posters , t-shirts that showed common cause with left-wing terrorist movements . but , in 2003 , the green party decriminalized it when they shared power with the social democrats in the federal government .
earlier this year , in keeping with the liberalized law , germany 's federal administrative court ruled that general calls for jihad were no longer punishable as propaganda for a terrorist group . a deterrent to " virtual jihad " " it 's an important trial because it will shed light on whether what happens in closed chat groups on the internet falls under freedom of expression or whether you can penalize it if there 's proof of planned attacks , " said carstensen . whatever the outcome of the " cyber jihadist " trial , some say it will set a precedent .
tophoven said the trial would be an important step in countering " virtual jihad . " " it will act as a deterrent for future internet users toying with the idea of playing terrorist . " the trial is expected to continue until january 2008 . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.09.2007 eu says airlines must cut carbon dioxide emissions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants airlines too to contribute to the fight against climate change the eu has reaffirmed a controversial plan to force airlines using european airspace to cut greenhouse gas emissions despite opposition from both the aviation industry and the us . the european union on friday said it would stick to a plan to include airlines in its overall strategy to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .
the plan also has the airline industry up in arms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are resisting following energy companies into joining europe 's carbon emissions trading scheme giovanni bisigani , director general and ceo of the geneva-based international air transport association or iata , which represents 250 airlines around the world , said the eu 's approach was " disappointing and irresponsible . "
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt airport is one of europe 's busiest the fees are not intended to raise the airport operators ' bottom-line , as revenue losses from airlines emitting the fewest emissions would be balanced by planes emitting more environmentally damaging nitrogen oxides .
the effect on ticket prices will depend on the airline , officials in berlin said .
companies operating older fleets may pass the higher fees on to customers while , ideally , the lower fees paid by airlines with more modern plane could lead to a drop in prices . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .
the eu passed a law which set a safe and acceptable level of air pollution for all member states in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : councils could pay for treatment of pollution-related illnesses the federal ministry of the environment and other conservation organizations praised the ruling .
" with this decision , the high quality of german air , in principle , is assured , " matthias machnig , the government 's assistant environment secretary , said in berlin .
jürgen resch , the chief of the german environmental help agency , called the decision " a breakthrough in the fight against air pollution . "

munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt airport is one of europe 's busiest the fees are not intended to raise the airport operators ' bottom-line , as revenue losses from airlines emitting the fewest emissions would be balanced by planes emitting more environmentally damaging nitrogen oxides .
the effect on ticket prices will depend on the airline , officials in berlin said .
companies operating older fleets may pass the higher fees on to customers while , ideally , the lower fees paid by airlines with more modern plane could lead to a drop in prices . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .
the eu passed a law which set a safe and acceptable level of air pollution for all member states in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : councils could pay for treatment of pollution-related illnesses the federal ministry of the environment and other conservation organizations praised the ruling .
" with this decision , the high quality of german air , in principle , is assured , " matthias machnig , the government 's assistant environment secretary , said in berlin .
jürgen resch , the chief of the german environmental help agency , called the decision " a breakthrough in the fight against air pollution . "
more bad news for automotive industry ?
meanwhile richard mergner of the alliance for nature conservation in bavaria said that he expected the court 's decision to have a knock-on effect in the german automotive industry .
german carmakers already face a potential new eu law which would require new cars to have average co2 emissions of 120 grams per kilometer .
german carmakers are expected to be hit especially hard by the new regulation : producers of luxury vehicles , such as porsche , daimler , bmw and audi , far exceed the emissions target and lag behind when it comes to hybrid technology that 's been pushed by companies such as toyota and honda .
a nationwide spate of cases against local authorities over the quality of air may force the german government to take its own action against polluters to avoid a slide into environmental litigiousness . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

asian countries need to step forward and strongly condemn the regime , said dw 's klaus dahmann . pinning hopes on the united nations security council is often pointless .
once again , the council has left the impression that when its authority is needed the most , the highest un committee remains divided .
what sounds good on paper - the task of protecting world peace - has proved in practice to once again be a sham .
myanmar is the most recent example of this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dahmann during the cold war there were two great powers - the united states and the soviet union - which mutually blocked each other on principle .
nowadays , individual interests can water down toughly-worded draft resolutions .
the united states has on several occasions prevented a condemnation of israel 's use of force in the middle east .
russia 's support of serbia has pushed a solution to the future of kosovo far into the future .
and now it is china 's " no " that has stopped harsher action to be taken against the junta in myanmar .
the powerful 15-member council has too often proved to be a toothless tiger .
that has something to do with the fact that , with the end of the east-west conflict , the threat scenario has changed radically .
the former superpowers are no longer conducting proxy wars against each other in korea , vietnam or afghanistan .
instead , criminal power-hungry politicians who spark local wars , have taken their place .
the security council then duly notes that the un may not interfere with a country 's " internal affairs . "
that 's what china 's doing in myanmar - one really ca n't speak of a " threat to world peace , " a situation for which the un security council was created , says beijing .
and that is wrong .
the issue is no longer an " internal affair " when a regime , such as the one in myanmar , uses armed force against peaceful demonstrators , or when it arrests protesting citizens , or when it does not shy away from murder .
then it becomes an issue of defending basic human rights .
as the recent days have shown , doing nothing only encourages the generals to use still more force against the demonstrators .
those who should care the most about the crisis in myanmar - china and india - have long kept silent about these human rights violations .
china , with the olympics looming , should have every reason to want to present itself as a democratic " mr. clean " as does india , which prides itself on being the " world 's largest democracy . "
but china and india do n't want to endanger their economic interests in myanmar , a country rich in raw materials .
now , they have joined other association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- countries in finally issuing a statement on events in myanmar - but it comes late and is not enough .
it 's necessary to put more pressure on the junta in myanmar , pressure and the asean states chiefly must be the ones to apply it .
having a cruel , unjust regime in their neighbourhood is a latent risk that also threatens asean security .

the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .
the plan also has the airline industry up in arms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are resisting following energy companies into joining europe 's carbon emissions trading scheme giovanni bisigani , director general and ceo of the geneva-based international air transport association or iata , which represents 250 airlines around the world , said the eu 's approach was " disappointing and irresponsible . "
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .

the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .
the plan also has the airline industry up in arms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are resisting following energy companies into joining europe 's carbon emissions trading scheme giovanni bisigani , director general and ceo of the geneva-based international air transport association or iata , which represents 250 airlines around the world , said the eu 's approach was " disappointing and irresponsible . "
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .

in january , a squabble between russia and belarus temporarily disrupted supplies headed towards western europe and past disputes over gas with ukraine have had similar consequences .

27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .
the eu passed a law which set a safe and acceptable level of air pollution for all member states in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : councils could pay for treatment of pollution-related illnesses the federal ministry of the environment and other conservation organizations praised the ruling .
" with this decision , the high quality of german air , in principle , is assured , " matthias machnig , the government 's assistant environment secretary , said in berlin .
jürgen resch , the chief of the german environmental help agency , called the decision " a breakthrough in the fight against air pollution . "
more bad news for automotive industry ?
meanwhile richard mergner of the alliance for nature conservation in bavaria said that he expected the court 's decision to have a knock-on effect in the german automotive industry .
german carmakers already face a potential new eu law which would require new cars to have average co2 emissions of 120 grams per kilometer .
german carmakers are expected to be hit especially hard by the new regulation : producers of luxury vehicles , such as porsche , daimler , bmw and audi , far exceed the emissions target and lag behind when it comes to hybrid technology that 's been pushed by companies such as toyota and honda .
a nationwide spate of cases against local authorities over the quality of air may force the german government to take its own action against polluters to avoid a slide into environmental litigiousness . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the first case of its kind in germany , a man went on trial this week in the northern city of celle for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists . the 36-year-old iraqi-born kurdish defendant , known as ibrahim r. , is accused of using the internet as a " terror weapon " and conducting his own " personal jihad on the computer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials observed the defendant 's internet habits for 18 months the defendant , who was under observation by security officials for a year and a half , also faces charges of attempting to recruit members and supporters for two terrorist networks , al qaeda and " al qaeda in iraq . " peter ernst , the main prosecutor in the case , said the " main propaganda path for al qaeda is the internet , where jihad is also carried out virtually . " " virtual supermarket for terrorists " federal prosecutors said the defendant , who was arrested last october and has been jailed pending trial ever since , spent hours surfing the internet and logged on in the chatroom under seven different pseudonyms . the audio and video files he downloaded from the internet and posted in the chatroom contained messages by bin laden and abu musab al-sarkawi , the now dead leader of al qaeda in iraq , and include the justification of terrorist attacks and incitement of hatred against jews .
the defendant himself occasionally appealed for participation in jihad , or holy war , prosecutors added . the case , experts say , underscores the increasing significance of the role of the internet in global terrorism .
known to offer everything from sources of terror financing , the sale of chemicals and fertilizers , recruitment of members , to a complete terrorist attack how-to guide , monitoring the web has long been high on counter-terrorism experts ' list .

it started by , among other things , making membership in a foreign terror group a crime .
more recently , the foiling of potentially deadly bombings has german politicians pushing for stricter anti-terror legislation to criminalize training for an attack or obtaining weapons or other substances in order to carry out an attack . but the present case in celle covers new legal ground , according to klaus rüther , ibrahim r. 's lawyer , because the defendant is solely charged with actions on the internet . " this is about distributing speeches online by members of terrorist groups , and not something like building bombs , buying a ticket to pakistan or funding radical groups , " rüther said , adding there was a difference between general propaganda for al qaeda and targeted recruiting of members and supporters . some of the speeches by bin laden were broadcast on the arab tv network al jazeera he said , adding that anyone could have seen them if they wanted to . downloading such video clips and passing them on to others is legal in germany , rüther said , adding that the case risked putting the german justice system on a slippery slope that could lead to " criminal law being broadened to cover laws on political convictions . " hard to make a case experts agree that prosecutors will have a tough time making a case , because they will have to prove that ibrahim r. had intentions to plan attacks or recruit new members for al qaeda through the online distribution of hate material and terrorist propaganda . " did the defendant do more than simply view bin laden recordings and pass them on ?
why did he do it ? " asked tophoven .
" that will be the decisive point in the trial . " bernd carstensen , press spokesman for germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- pointed out that merely sympathizing with terrorist groups was no longer a crime in germany . " simply distributing terrorist propaganda no longer suffices in germany for a prosecution , " carstensen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until 2003 , sporting a bin laden sticker would have been illegal in germany sympathizing with terror groups or distributing propaganda was made a punishable offence under section 129a of germany 's penal code in the 1970s , when attacks by groups like the red army faction sparked widespread terrorism fears across the country .
that included writings , pamphlets , posters , t-shirts that showed common cause with left-wing terrorist movements . but , in 2003 , the green party decriminalized it when they shared power with the social democrats in the federal government .
earlier this year , in keeping with the liberalized law , germany 's federal administrative court ruled that general calls for jihad were no longer punishable as propaganda for a terrorist group . a deterrent to " virtual jihad " " it 's an important trial because it will shed light on whether what happens in closed chat groups on the internet falls under freedom of expression or whether you can penalize it if there 's proof of planned attacks , " said carstensen . whatever the outcome of the " cyber jihadist " trial , some say it will set a precedent .
tophoven said the trial would be an important step in countering " virtual jihad . " " it will act as a deterrent for future internet users toying with the idea of playing terrorist .

28 , president bush called for a " strong and transparent " way for nations to measure progress on fighting climate change but said that each country should set its own approach .
bush also called for the creation of a new global fund that would help developing nations pay for clean-energy projects .
the conference was the first in a series of talks among major polluting nations that bush has called for .
" our nations have an opportunity to leave the debates of the past behind and reach a consensus on the way forward and that 's our purpose today , " bush said to an audience that included representatives from european countries as well developing ones .
the us is the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases though experts believe china may soon surpass it .
" small step for mankind " however , the us president 's speech did n't convince many european officials who remained skeptical that the conference hosted by bush at the state department would help key un climate talks in bali in december .
the bali talks will aim to launch a successor to the kyoto protocol which sets limits on industrial nations ' emissions and which expires in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was not in a conciliatory mood " this here was a great step for the americans and a small step for mankind , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told journalists in washington .
" in substance , we are still far apart . "
bush 's emphasis on voluntary approaches rather than the firm targets pushed by many european countries also raised a few eyebrows .
a long-term goal for reducing global warming was needed , bush said , but added that " each nation will design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this . "
" one of the striking features of this meeting is how isolated this administration has become .
there is absolutely no support that i can see in the international community that we can drive this effort on the basis of voluntary efforts , " john ashton , a special representative on climate change for the british foreign secretary , said in an interview . " i do n't think that this meeting by itself moves the ball very much at all .
the much more significant meeting this week was at the un where there was a sense of urgency . "
criticism at odds with merkel 's statements bush 's proposal to expand nuclear energy to fight climate change and his statement that carbon dioxide emissions would be much higher today if it were n't for the 439 nuclear power plants worldwide was sharply criticised by germany 's gabriel .
" i do n't it 's particularly clever to give the world the message : build new nuclear plants , " gabriel said .
" first you urge people to expand nuclear energy and then you send in nato to bomb the nuclear power plants because they did the wrong thing - that is n't particularly intelligent politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was full of praise for bush 's initiative on climate change gabriel 's combativeness is in sharp contrast to chancellor angela merkel 's statements on us climate policy .
earlier this week at the sidelines of the un assembly in new york , merkel welcomed bush 's invitation to the world 's 16 worst polluters for climate talks .
" i think it 's very important because it makes it clear that the americans are back in the climate process , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , president bush called for a " strong and transparent " way for nations to measure progress on fighting climate change but said that each country should set its own approach .
bush also called for the creation of a new global fund that would help developing nations pay for clean-energy projects .
the conference was the first in a series of talks among major polluting nations that bush has called for .
" our nations have an opportunity to leave the debates of the past behind and reach a consensus on the way forward and that 's our purpose today , " bush said to an audience that included representatives from european countries as well developing ones .
the us is the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases though experts believe china may soon surpass it .
" small step for mankind " however , the us president 's speech did n't convince many european officials who remained skeptical that the conference hosted by bush at the state department would help key un climate talks in bali in december .
the bali talks will aim to launch a successor to the kyoto protocol which sets limits on industrial nations ' emissions and which expires in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was not in a conciliatory mood " this here was a great step for the americans and a small step for mankind , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told journalists in washington .
" in substance , we are still far apart . "
bush 's emphasis on voluntary approaches rather than the firm targets pushed by many european countries also raised a few eyebrows .
a long-term goal for reducing global warming was needed , bush said , but added that " each nation will design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this . "
" one of the striking features of this meeting is how isolated this administration has become .
there is absolutely no support that i can see in the international community that we can drive this effort on the basis of voluntary efforts , " john ashton , a special representative on climate change for the british foreign secretary , said in an interview . " i do n't think that this meeting by itself moves the ball very much at all .
the much more significant meeting this week was at the un where there was a sense of urgency . "
criticism at odds with merkel 's statements bush 's proposal to expand nuclear energy to fight climate change and his statement that carbon dioxide emissions would be much higher today if it were n't for the 439 nuclear power plants worldwide was sharply criticised by germany 's gabriel .
" i do n't it 's particularly clever to give the world the message : build new nuclear plants , " gabriel said .
" first you urge people to expand nuclear energy and then you send in nato to bomb the nuclear power plants because they did the wrong thing - that is n't particularly intelligent politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was full of praise for bush 's initiative on climate change gabriel 's combativeness is in sharp contrast to chancellor angela merkel 's statements on us climate policy .
earlier this week at the sidelines of the un assembly in new york , merkel welcomed bush 's invitation to the world 's 16 worst polluters for climate talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 28.09.2007 opinion : asian countries need to stand up to myanmar 's junta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council issued a benign statement of concern over myanmar 's violent crackdown against peaceful protestors .
asian countries need to step forward and strongly condemn the regime , said dw 's klaus dahmann . pinning hopes on the united nations security council is often pointless .
once again , the council has left the impression that when its authority is needed the most , the highest un committee remains divided .
what sounds good on paper - the task of protecting world peace - has proved in practice to once again be a sham .
myanmar is the most recent example of this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dahmann during the cold war there were two great powers - the united states and the soviet union - which mutually blocked each other on principle .
nowadays , individual interests can water down toughly-worded draft resolutions .
the united states has on several occasions prevented a condemnation of israel 's use of force in the middle east .
russia 's support of serbia has pushed a solution to the future of kosovo far into the future .
and now it is china 's " no " that has stopped harsher action to be taken against the junta in myanmar .
the powerful 15-member council has too often proved to be a toothless tiger .
that has something to do with the fact that , with the end of the east-west conflict , the threat scenario has changed radically .
the former superpowers are no longer conducting proxy wars against each other in korea , vietnam or afghanistan .
instead , criminal power-hungry politicians who spark local wars , have taken their place .
the security council then duly notes that the un may not interfere with a country 's " internal affairs . "
that 's what china 's doing in myanmar - one really ca n't speak of a " threat to world peace , " a situation for which the un security council was created , says beijing .
and that is wrong .
the issue is no longer an " internal affair " when a regime , such as the one in myanmar , uses armed force against peaceful demonstrators , or when it arrests protesting citizens , or when it does not shy away from murder .
then it becomes an issue of defending basic human rights .
as the recent days have shown , doing nothing only encourages the generals to use still more force against the demonstrators .
those who should care the most about the crisis in myanmar - china and india - have long kept silent about these human rights violations .
china , with the olympics looming , should have every reason to want to present itself as a democratic " mr. clean " as does india , which prides itself on being the " world 's largest democracy . "
but china and india do n't want to endanger their economic interests in myanmar , a country rich in raw materials .
now , they have joined other association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- countries in finally issuing a statement on events in myanmar - but it comes late and is not enough .
it 's necessary to put more pressure on the junta in myanmar , pressure and the asean states chiefly must be the ones to apply it .
having a cruel , unjust regime in their neighbourhood is a latent risk that also threatens asean security .
and a democracy there would be a positive thing for their economic interests .

in january , a squabble between russia and belarus temporarily disrupted supplies headed towards western europe and past disputes over gas with ukraine have had similar consequences .
the belarus disruption convinced european politicians they needed to develop a new and united energy strategy that would help overcome the bloc 's members ' worries about sovereignty issues .
on wednesday , sept .

a solidarity clause would help poland in case of an interruption in its supply from russia .

27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .
the eu passed a law which set a safe and acceptable level of air pollution for all member states in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : councils could pay for treatment of pollution-related illnesses the federal ministry of the environment and other conservation organizations praised the ruling .
" with this decision , the high quality of german air , in principle , is assured , " matthias machnig , the government 's assistant environment secretary , said in berlin .
jürgen resch , the chief of the german environmental help agency , called the decision " a breakthrough in the fight against air pollution . "
more bad news for automotive industry ?
meanwhile richard mergner of the alliance for nature conservation in bavaria said that he expected the court 's decision to have a knock-on effect in the german automotive industry .
german carmakers already face a potential new eu law which would require new cars to have average co2 emissions of 120 grams per kilometer .
german carmakers are expected to be hit especially hard by the new regulation : producers of luxury vehicles , such as porsche , daimler , bmw and audi , far exceed the emissions target and lag behind when it comes to hybrid technology that 's been pushed by companies such as toyota and honda .

those details are on the mind of ferran tarradellas espuny , spokesman for energy commissioner andris piebalgs about parliamentary resolution .
" mr. energy " needs his responsibilities to be clearly outlined , which is missing from the current proposal , tarradellas espuny said . whether the energy representative should focus on gas or oil prices , the role of diversification of energy sources and what to do if a crisis occurs , were among the issues tarradellas espuny said still needed to be addressed .
poland wants energy solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connected and coordinated : europe 's future energy regime poland was a vocal proponent of including a solidarity clause in the eu legislation .
the country depends on russian gas and oil for about 90 percent of its energy imports and also serves as transit country for energy headed further west .
a solidarity clause would help poland in case of an interruption in its supply from russia .
but poland has been criticized for pushing energy solidarity while remaining opposed to other eu initiatives , such as the current attempt to reform the eu charter and its past opposition to the eu negotiating energy issues with russia over domestic trade issues .
diversification remains fundamental bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe looks towards sun and wind alternatives europe has realized it needs to diversify .
officials have called for both increasing the use of alternative energies , including such as solar and wind energy , as well as finding new sources for oil and gas .
norway and algeria are among the eu 's current favorites .
norway currently provides about 15 percent of the eu 's oil requirements .

asian countries need to step forward and strongly condemn the regime , said dw 's klaus dahmann . pinning hopes on the united nations security council is often pointless .
once again , the council has left the impression that when its authority is needed the most , the highest un committee remains divided .
what sounds good on paper - the task of protecting world peace - has proved in practice to once again be a sham .
myanmar is the most recent example of this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dahmann during the cold war there were two great powers - the united states and the soviet union - which mutually blocked each other on principle .
nowadays , individual interests can water down toughly-worded draft resolutions .
the united states has on several occasions prevented a condemnation of israel 's use of force in the middle east .
russia 's support of serbia has pushed a solution to the future of kosovo far into the future .
and now it is china 's " no " that has stopped harsher action to be taken against the junta in myanmar .
the powerful 15-member council has too often proved to be a toothless tiger .
that has something to do with the fact that , with the end of the east-west conflict , the threat scenario has changed radically .
the former superpowers are no longer conducting proxy wars against each other in korea , vietnam or afghanistan .
instead , criminal power-hungry politicians who spark local wars , have taken their place .
the security council then duly notes that the un may not interfere with a country 's " internal affairs . "
that 's what china 's doing in myanmar - one really ca n't speak of a " threat to world peace , " a situation for which the un security council was created , says beijing .
and that is wrong .
the issue is no longer an " internal affair " when a regime , such as the one in myanmar , uses armed force against peaceful demonstrators , or when it arrests protesting citizens , or when it does not shy away from murder .
then it becomes an issue of defending basic human rights .
as the recent days have shown , doing nothing only encourages the generals to use still more force against the demonstrators .
those who should care the most about the crisis in myanmar - china and india - have long kept silent about these human rights violations .
china , with the olympics looming , should have every reason to want to present itself as a democratic " mr. clean " as does india , which prides itself on being the " world 's largest democracy . "
but china and india do n't want to endanger their economic interests in myanmar , a country rich in raw materials .
now , they have joined other association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- countries in finally issuing a statement on events in myanmar - but it comes late and is not enough .
it 's necessary to put more pressure on the junta in myanmar , pressure and the asean states chiefly must be the ones to apply it .
having a cruel , unjust regime in their neighbourhood is a latent risk that also threatens asean security .
and a democracy there would be a positive thing for their economic interests .
in the long run , asean and not the un must prove to be a functional organization in the myanmar case .

" in the first case of its kind in germany , a man went on trial this week in the northern city of celle for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists . the 36-year-old iraqi-born kurdish defendant , known as ibrahim r. , is accused of using the internet as a " terror weapon " and conducting his own " personal jihad on the computer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials observed the defendant 's internet habits for 18 months the defendant , who was under observation by security officials for a year and a half , also faces charges of attempting to recruit members and supporters for two terrorist networks , al qaeda and " al qaeda in iraq . " peter ernst , the main prosecutor in the case , said the " main propaganda path for al qaeda is the internet , where jihad is also carried out virtually . " " virtual supermarket for terrorists " federal prosecutors said the defendant , who was arrested last october and has been jailed pending trial ever since , spent hours surfing the internet and logged on in the chatroom under seven different pseudonyms . the audio and video files he downloaded from the internet and posted in the chatroom contained messages by bin laden and abu musab al-sarkawi , the now dead leader of al qaeda in iraq , and include the justification of terrorist attacks and incitement of hatred against jews .
the defendant himself occasionally appealed for participation in jihad , or holy war , prosecutors added . the case , experts say , underscores the increasing significance of the role of the internet in global terrorism .
known to offer everything from sources of terror financing , the sale of chemicals and fertilizers , recruitment of members , to a complete terrorist attack how-to guide , monitoring the web has long been high on counter-terrorism experts ' list . " this trial is a milestone in terms of fighting terrorism on the internet and will be watched closely , " said rolf tophoven , director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and security policy .
" the internet today has become a virtual supermarket for terrorists , where they can find everything they need to prepare for attacks . " new legal ground ? yet , the " cyber jihadist " case also raises questions about what constitutes terrorism , and reflects germany 's struggle to deal with new threats with the right legal tools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the sept .
11 suicide pilots , including mohammed atta , had lived in hamburg germany first toughened its anti-terror laws after it emerged that three of the sept .
11 , 2001 , suicide pilots had lived in hamburg .
it started by , among other things , making membership in a foreign terror group a crime .
more recently , the foiling of potentially deadly bombings has german politicians pushing for stricter anti-terror legislation to criminalize training for an attack or obtaining weapons or other substances in order to carry out an attack . but the present case in celle covers new legal ground , according to klaus rüther , ibrahim r. 's lawyer , because the defendant is solely charged with actions on the internet . " this is about distributing speeches online by members of terrorist groups , and not something like building bombs , buying a ticket to pakistan or funding radical groups , " rüther said , adding there was a difference between general propaganda for al qaeda and targeted recruiting of members and supporters . some of the speeches by bin laden were broadcast on the arab tv network al jazeera he said , adding that anyone could have seen them if they wanted to . downloading such video clips and passing them on to others is legal in germany , rüther said , adding that the case risked putting the german justice system on a slippery slope that could lead to " criminal law being broadened to cover laws on political convictions . " hard to make a case experts agree that prosecutors will have a tough time making a case , because they will have to prove that ibrahim r. had intentions to plan attacks or recruit new members for al qaeda through the online distribution of hate material and terrorist propaganda . " did the defendant do more than simply view bin laden recordings and pass them on ?
why did he do it ? " asked tophoven .
" that will be the decisive point in the trial . " bernd carstensen , press spokesman for germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- pointed out that merely sympathizing with terrorist groups was no longer a crime in germany . " simply distributing terrorist propaganda no longer suffices in germany for a prosecution , " carstensen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until 2003 , sporting a bin laden sticker would have been illegal in germany sympathizing with terror groups or distributing propaganda was made a punishable offence under section 129a of germany 's penal code in the 1970s , when attacks by groups like the red army faction sparked widespread terrorism fears across the country .
that included writings , pamphlets , posters , t-shirts that showed common cause with left-wing terrorist movements . but , in 2003 , the green party decriminalized it when they shared power with the social democrats in the federal government .
earlier this year , in keeping with the liberalized law , germany 's federal administrative court ruled that general calls for jihad were no longer punishable as propaganda for a terrorist group . a deterrent to " virtual jihad " " it 's an important trial because it will shed light on whether what happens in closed chat groups on the internet falls under freedom of expression or whether you can penalize it if there 's proof of planned attacks , " said carstensen . whatever the outcome of the " cyber jihadist " trial , some say it will set a precedent .
tophoven said the trial would be an important step in countering " virtual jihad . " " it will act as a deterrent for future internet users toying with the idea of playing terrorist . " the trial is expected to continue until january 2008 . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the first case of its kind in germany , a man went on trial this week in the northern city of celle for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists . the 36-year-old iraqi-born kurdish defendant , known as ibrahim r. , is accused of using the internet as a " terror weapon " and conducting his own " personal jihad on the computer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials observed the defendant 's internet habits for 18 months the defendant , who was under observation by security officials for a year and a half , also faces charges of attempting to recruit members and supporters for two terrorist networks , al qaeda and " al qaeda in iraq . " peter ernst , the main prosecutor in the case , said the " main propaganda path for al qaeda is the internet , where jihad is also carried out virtually . " " virtual supermarket for terrorists " federal prosecutors said the defendant , who was arrested last october and has been jailed pending trial ever since , spent hours surfing the internet and logged on in the chatroom under seven different pseudonyms . the audio and video files he downloaded from the internet and posted in the chatroom contained messages by bin laden and abu musab al-sarkawi , the now dead leader of al qaeda in iraq , and include the justification of terrorist attacks and incitement of hatred against jews .
the defendant himself occasionally appealed for participation in jihad , or holy war , prosecutors added . the case , experts say , underscores the increasing significance of the role of the internet in global terrorism .
known to offer everything from sources of terror financing , the sale of chemicals and fertilizers , recruitment of members , to a complete terrorist attack how-to guide , monitoring the web has long been high on counter-terrorism experts ' list . " this trial is a milestone in terms of fighting terrorism on the internet and will be watched closely , " said rolf tophoven , director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and security policy .
" the internet today has become a virtual supermarket for terrorists , where they can find everything they need to prepare for attacks . " new legal ground ? yet , the " cyber jihadist " case also raises questions about what constitutes terrorism , and reflects germany 's struggle to deal with new threats with the right legal tools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the sept .
11 suicide pilots , including mohammed atta , had lived in hamburg germany first toughened its anti-terror laws after it emerged that three of the sept .
11 , 2001 , suicide pilots had lived in hamburg .
it started by , among other things , making membership in a foreign terror group a crime .
more recently , the foiling of potentially deadly bombings has german politicians pushing for stricter anti-terror legislation to criminalize training for an attack or obtaining weapons or other substances in order to carry out an attack . but the present case in celle covers new legal ground , according to klaus rüther , ibrahim r. 's lawyer , because the defendant is solely charged with actions on the internet . " this is about distributing speeches online by members of terrorist groups , and not something like building bombs , buying a ticket to pakistan or funding radical groups , " rüther said , adding there was a difference between general propaganda for al qaeda and targeted recruiting of members and supporters . some of the speeches by bin laden were broadcast on the arab tv network al jazeera he said , adding that anyone could have seen them if they wanted to . downloading such video clips and passing them on to others is legal in germany , rüther said , adding that the case risked putting the german justice system on a slippery slope that could lead to " criminal law being broadened to cover laws on political convictions . " hard to make a case experts agree that prosecutors will have a tough time making a case , because they will have to prove that ibrahim r. had intentions to plan attacks or recruit new members for al qaeda through the online distribution of hate material and terrorist propaganda . " did the defendant do more than simply view bin laden recordings and pass them on ?
why did he do it ? " asked tophoven .
" that will be the decisive point in the trial . " bernd carstensen , press spokesman for germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- pointed out that merely sympathizing with terrorist groups was no longer a crime in germany . " simply distributing terrorist propaganda no longer suffices in germany for a prosecution , " carstensen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until 2003 , sporting a bin laden sticker would have been illegal in germany sympathizing with terror groups or distributing propaganda was made a punishable offence under section 129a of germany 's penal code in the 1970s , when attacks by groups like the red army faction sparked widespread terrorism fears across the country .
that included writings , pamphlets , posters , t-shirts that showed common cause with left-wing terrorist movements . but , in 2003 , the green party decriminalized it when they shared power with the social democrats in the federal government .
earlier this year , in keeping with the liberalized law , germany 's federal administrative court ruled that general calls for jihad were no longer punishable as propaganda for a terrorist group . a deterrent to " virtual jihad " " it 's an important trial because it will shed light on whether what happens in closed chat groups on the internet falls under freedom of expression or whether you can penalize it if there 's proof of planned attacks , " said carstensen . whatever the outcome of the " cyber jihadist " trial , some say it will set a precedent .
tophoven said the trial would be an important step in countering " virtual jihad . " " it will act as a deterrent for future internet users toying with the idea of playing terrorist . " the trial is expected to continue until january 2008 . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 28.09.2007 opinion : asian countries need to stand up to myanmar 's junta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council issued a benign statement of concern over myanmar 's violent crackdown against peaceful protestors .
asian countries need to step forward and strongly condemn the regime , said dw 's klaus dahmann . pinning hopes on the united nations security council is often pointless .
once again , the council has left the impression that when its authority is needed the most , the highest un committee remains divided .
what sounds good on paper - the task of protecting world peace - has proved in practice to once again be a sham .
myanmar is the most recent example of this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dahmann during the cold war there were two great powers - the united states and the soviet union - which mutually blocked each other on principle .
nowadays , individual interests can water down toughly-worded draft resolutions .
the united states has on several occasions prevented a condemnation of israel 's use of force in the middle east .
russia 's support of serbia has pushed a solution to the future of kosovo far into the future .
and now it is china 's " no " that has stopped harsher action to be taken against the junta in myanmar .
the powerful 15-member council has too often proved to be a toothless tiger .
that has something to do with the fact that , with the end of the east-west conflict , the threat scenario has changed radically .
the former superpowers are no longer conducting proxy wars against each other in korea , vietnam or afghanistan .
instead , criminal power-hungry politicians who spark local wars , have taken their place .
the security council then duly notes that the un may not interfere with a country 's " internal affairs . "
that 's what china 's doing in myanmar - one really ca n't speak of a " threat to world peace , " a situation for which the un security council was created , says beijing .
and that is wrong .
the issue is no longer an " internal affair " when a regime , such as the one in myanmar , uses armed force against peaceful demonstrators , or when it arrests protesting citizens , or when it does not shy away from murder .
then it becomes an issue of defending basic human rights .
as the recent days have shown , doing nothing only encourages the generals to use still more force against the demonstrators .
those who should care the most about the crisis in myanmar - china and india - have long kept silent about these human rights violations .
china , with the olympics looming , should have every reason to want to present itself as a democratic " mr. clean " as does india , which prides itself on being the " world 's largest democracy . "
but china and india do n't want to endanger their economic interests in myanmar , a country rich in raw materials .
now , they have joined other association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- countries in finally issuing a statement on events in myanmar - but it comes late and is not enough .
it 's necessary to put more pressure on the junta in myanmar , pressure and the asean states chiefly must be the ones to apply it .
having a cruel , unjust regime in their neighbourhood is a latent risk that also threatens asean security .
and a democracy there would be a positive thing for their economic interests .
in the long run , asean and not the un must prove to be a functional organization in the myanmar case .

the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .
the plan also has the airline industry up in arms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are resisting following energy companies into joining europe 's carbon emissions trading scheme giovanni bisigani , director general and ceo of the geneva-based international air transport association or iata , which represents 250 airlines around the world , said the eu 's approach was " disappointing and irresponsible . "
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .

" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .
the plan also has the airline industry up in arms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are resisting following energy companies into joining europe 's carbon emissions trading scheme giovanni bisigani , director general and ceo of the geneva-based international air transport association or iata , which represents 250 airlines around the world , said the eu 's approach was " disappointing and irresponsible . "
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt airport is one of europe 's busiest the fees are not intended to raise the airport operators ' bottom-line , as revenue losses from airlines emitting the fewest emissions would be balanced by planes emitting more environmentally damaging nitrogen oxides .

the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .

asian countries need to step forward and strongly condemn the regime , said dw 's klaus dahmann . pinning hopes on the united nations security council is often pointless .
once again , the council has left the impression that when its authority is needed the most , the highest un committee remains divided .
what sounds good on paper - the task of protecting world peace - has proved in practice to once again be a sham .
myanmar is the most recent example of this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dahmann during the cold war there were two great powers - the united states and the soviet union - which mutually blocked each other on principle .
nowadays , individual interests can water down toughly-worded draft resolutions .
the united states has on several occasions prevented a condemnation of israel 's use of force in the middle east .
russia 's support of serbia has pushed a solution to the future of kosovo far into the future .
and now it is china 's " no " that has stopped harsher action to be taken against the junta in myanmar .
the powerful 15-member council has too often proved to be a toothless tiger .
that has something to do with the fact that , with the end of the east-west conflict , the threat scenario has changed radically .
the former superpowers are no longer conducting proxy wars against each other in korea , vietnam or afghanistan .
instead , criminal power-hungry politicians who spark local wars , have taken their place .
the security council then duly notes that the un may not interfere with a country 's " internal affairs . "
that 's what china 's doing in myanmar - one really ca n't speak of a " threat to world peace , " a situation for which the un security council was created , says beijing .
and that is wrong .
the issue is no longer an " internal affair " when a regime , such as the one in myanmar , uses armed force against peaceful demonstrators , or when it arrests protesting citizens , or when it does not shy away from murder .
then it becomes an issue of defending basic human rights .
as the recent days have shown , doing nothing only encourages the generals to use still more force against the demonstrators .
those who should care the most about the crisis in myanmar - china and india - have long kept silent about these human rights violations .
china , with the olympics looming , should have every reason to want to present itself as a democratic " mr. clean " as does india , which prides itself on being the " world 's largest democracy . "
but china and india do n't want to endanger their economic interests in myanmar , a country rich in raw materials .
now , they have joined other association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- countries in finally issuing a statement on events in myanmar - but it comes late and is not enough .
it 's necessary to put more pressure on the junta in myanmar , pressure and the asean states chiefly must be the ones to apply it .
having a cruel , unjust regime in their neighbourhood is a latent risk that also threatens asean security .
and a democracy there would be a positive thing for their economic interests .
in the long run , asean and not the un must prove to be a functional organization in the myanmar case .

asian countries need to step forward and strongly condemn the regime , said dw 's klaus dahmann . pinning hopes on the united nations security council is often pointless .
once again , the council has left the impression that when its authority is needed the most , the highest un committee remains divided .
what sounds good on paper - the task of protecting world peace - has proved in practice to once again be a sham .
myanmar is the most recent example of this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus dahmann during the cold war there were two great powers - the united states and the soviet union - which mutually blocked each other on principle .
nowadays , individual interests can water down toughly-worded draft resolutions .
the united states has on several occasions prevented a condemnation of israel 's use of force in the middle east .
russia 's support of serbia has pushed a solution to the future of kosovo far into the future .
and now it is china 's " no " that has stopped harsher action to be taken against the junta in myanmar .
the powerful 15-member council has too often proved to be a toothless tiger .
that has something to do with the fact that , with the end of the east-west conflict , the threat scenario has changed radically .
the former superpowers are no longer conducting proxy wars against each other in korea , vietnam or afghanistan .
instead , criminal power-hungry politicians who spark local wars , have taken their place .
the security council then duly notes that the un may not interfere with a country 's " internal affairs . "
that 's what china 's doing in myanmar - one really ca n't speak of a " threat to world peace , " a situation for which the un security council was created , says beijing .
and that is wrong .
the issue is no longer an " internal affair " when a regime , such as the one in myanmar , uses armed force against peaceful demonstrators , or when it arrests protesting citizens , or when it does not shy away from murder .
then it becomes an issue of defending basic human rights .
as the recent days have shown , doing nothing only encourages the generals to use still more force against the demonstrators .
those who should care the most about the crisis in myanmar - china and india - have long kept silent about these human rights violations .
china , with the olympics looming , should have every reason to want to present itself as a democratic " mr. clean " as does india , which prides itself on being the " world 's largest democracy . "
but china and india do n't want to endanger their economic interests in myanmar , a country rich in raw materials .
now , they have joined other association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- countries in finally issuing a statement on events in myanmar - but it comes late and is not enough .
it 's necessary to put more pressure on the junta in myanmar , pressure and the asean states chiefly must be the ones to apply it .
having a cruel , unjust regime in their neighbourhood is a latent risk that also threatens asean security .
and a democracy there would be a positive thing for their economic interests .
in the long run , asean and not the un must prove to be a functional organization in the myanmar case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 28.09.2007 " cyber jihadist " trial opens new front in anti-terror fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defining what constitutes terrorism on the internet poses new challenges for governments in a landmark case , a court in germany will decide whether posting terrorist propaganda and calls to violence on the internet is tantamount to supporting terrorism as it tries a man for conducting a " virtual jihad . " in the first case of its kind in germany , a man went on trial this week in the northern city of celle for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists . the 36-year-old iraqi-born kurdish defendant , known as ibrahim r. , is accused of using the internet as a " terror weapon " and conducting his own " personal jihad on the computer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials observed the defendant 's internet habits for 18 months the defendant , who was under observation by security officials for a year and a half , also faces charges of attempting to recruit members and supporters for two terrorist networks , al qaeda and " al qaeda in iraq . " peter ernst , the main prosecutor in the case , said the " main propaganda path for al qaeda is the internet , where jihad is also carried out virtually . " " virtual supermarket for terrorists " federal prosecutors said the defendant , who was arrested last october and has been jailed pending trial ever since , spent hours surfing the internet and logged on in the chatroom under seven different pseudonyms . the audio and video files he downloaded from the internet and posted in the chatroom contained messages by bin laden and abu musab al-sarkawi , the now dead leader of al qaeda in iraq , and include the justification of terrorist attacks and incitement of hatred against jews .
the defendant himself occasionally appealed for participation in jihad , or holy war , prosecutors added . the case , experts say , underscores the increasing significance of the role of the internet in global terrorism .
known to offer everything from sources of terror financing , the sale of chemicals and fertilizers , recruitment of members , to a complete terrorist attack how-to guide , monitoring the web has long been high on counter-terrorism experts ' list . " this trial is a milestone in terms of fighting terrorism on the internet and will be watched closely , " said rolf tophoven , director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and security policy .
" the internet today has become a virtual supermarket for terrorists , where they can find everything they need to prepare for attacks . " new legal ground ? yet , the " cyber jihadist " case also raises questions about what constitutes terrorism , and reflects germany 's struggle to deal with new threats with the right legal tools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the sept .
11 suicide pilots , including mohammed atta , had lived in hamburg germany first toughened its anti-terror laws after it emerged that three of the sept .
11 , 2001 , suicide pilots had lived in hamburg .
it started by , among other things , making membership in a foreign terror group a crime .
more recently , the foiling of potentially deadly bombings has german politicians pushing for stricter anti-terror legislation to criminalize training for an attack or obtaining weapons or other substances in order to carry out an attack . but the present case in celle covers new legal ground , according to klaus rüther , ibrahim r. 's lawyer , because the defendant is solely charged with actions on the internet . " this is about distributing speeches online by members of terrorist groups , and not something like building bombs , buying a ticket to pakistan or funding radical groups , " rüther said , adding there was a difference between general propaganda for al qaeda and targeted recruiting of members and supporters . some of the speeches by bin laden were broadcast on the arab tv network al jazeera he said , adding that anyone could have seen them if they wanted to . downloading such video clips and passing them on to others is legal in germany , rüther said , adding that the case risked putting the german justice system on a slippery slope that could lead to " criminal law being broadened to cover laws on political convictions . " hard to make a case experts agree that prosecutors will have a tough time making a case , because they will have to prove that ibrahim r. had intentions to plan attacks or recruit new members for al qaeda through the online distribution of hate material and terrorist propaganda . " did the defendant do more than simply view bin laden recordings and pass them on ?
why did he do it ? " asked tophoven .
" that will be the decisive point in the trial . " bernd carstensen , press spokesman for germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- pointed out that merely sympathizing with terrorist groups was no longer a crime in germany . " simply distributing terrorist propaganda no longer suffices in germany for a prosecution , " carstensen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until 2003 , sporting a bin laden sticker would have been illegal in germany sympathizing with terror groups or distributing propaganda was made a punishable offence under section 129a of germany 's penal code in the 1970s , when attacks by groups like the red army faction sparked widespread terrorism fears across the country .
that included writings , pamphlets , posters , t-shirts that showed common cause with left-wing terrorist movements . but , in 2003 , the green party decriminalized it when they shared power with the social democrats in the federal government .
earlier this year , in keeping with the liberalized law , germany 's federal administrative court ruled that general calls for jihad were no longer punishable as propaganda for a terrorist group . a deterrent to " virtual jihad " " it 's an important trial because it will shed light on whether what happens in closed chat groups on the internet falls under freedom of expression or whether you can penalize it if there 's proof of planned attacks , " said carstensen . whatever the outcome of the " cyber jihadist " trial , some say it will set a precedent .
tophoven said the trial would be an important step in countering " virtual jihad . " " it will act as a deterrent for future internet users toying with the idea of playing terrorist . " the trial is expected to continue until january 2008 . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .
the eu passed a law which set a safe and acceptable level of air pollution for all member states in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : councils could pay for treatment of pollution-related illnesses the federal ministry of the environment and other conservation organizations praised the ruling .
" with this decision , the high quality of german air , in principle , is assured , " matthias machnig , the government 's assistant environment secretary , said in berlin .
jürgen resch , the chief of the german environmental help agency , called the decision " a breakthrough in the fight against air pollution . "
more bad news for automotive industry ?
meanwhile richard mergner of the alliance for nature conservation in bavaria said that he expected the court 's decision to have a knock-on effect in the german automotive industry .
german carmakers already face a potential new eu law which would require new cars to have average co2 emissions of 120 grams per kilometer .
german carmakers are expected to be hit especially hard by the new regulation : producers of luxury vehicles , such as porsche , daimler , bmw and audi , far exceed the emissions target and lag behind when it comes to hybrid technology that 's been pushed by companies such as toyota and honda .
a nationwide spate of cases against local authorities over the quality of air may force the german government to take its own action against polluters to avoid a slide into environmental litigiousness . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , president bush called for a " strong and transparent " way for nations to measure progress on fighting climate change but said that each country should set its own approach .
bush also called for the creation of a new global fund that would help developing nations pay for clean-energy projects .
the conference was the first in a series of talks among major polluting nations that bush has called for .
" our nations have an opportunity to leave the debates of the past behind and reach a consensus on the way forward and that 's our purpose today , " bush said to an audience that included representatives from european countries as well developing ones .
the us is the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases though experts believe china may soon surpass it .
" small step for mankind " however , the us president 's speech did n't convince many european officials who remained skeptical that the conference hosted by bush at the state department would help key un climate talks in bali in december .
the bali talks will aim to launch a successor to the kyoto protocol which sets limits on industrial nations ' emissions and which expires in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was not in a conciliatory mood " this here was a great step for the americans and a small step for mankind , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told journalists in washington .
" in substance , we are still far apart . "
bush 's emphasis on voluntary approaches rather than the firm targets pushed by many european countries also raised a few eyebrows .
a long-term goal for reducing global warming was needed , bush said , but added that " each nation will design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this . "
" one of the striking features of this meeting is how isolated this administration has become .
there is absolutely no support that i can see in the international community that we can drive this effort on the basis of voluntary efforts , " john ashton , a special representative on climate change for the british foreign secretary , said in an interview . " i do n't think that this meeting by itself moves the ball very much at all .
the much more significant meeting this week was at the un where there was a sense of urgency . "
criticism at odds with merkel 's statements bush 's proposal to expand nuclear energy to fight climate change and his statement that carbon dioxide emissions would be much higher today if it were n't for the 439 nuclear power plants worldwide was sharply criticised by germany 's gabriel .
" i do n't it 's particularly clever to give the world the message : build new nuclear plants , " gabriel said .
" first you urge people to expand nuclear energy and then you send in nato to bomb the nuclear power plants because they did the wrong thing - that is n't particularly intelligent politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was full of praise for bush 's initiative on climate change gabriel 's combativeness is in sharp contrast to chancellor angela merkel 's statements on us climate policy .
earlier this week at the sidelines of the un assembly in new york , merkel welcomed bush 's invitation to the world 's 16 worst polluters for climate talks .
" i think it 's very important because it makes it clear that the americans are back in the climate process , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , president bush called for a " strong and transparent " way for nations to measure progress on fighting climate change but said that each country should set its own approach .
bush also called for the creation of a new global fund that would help developing nations pay for clean-energy projects .
the conference was the first in a series of talks among major polluting nations that bush has called for .
" our nations have an opportunity to leave the debates of the past behind and reach a consensus on the way forward and that 's our purpose today , " bush said to an audience that included representatives from european countries as well developing ones .
the us is the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases though experts believe china may soon surpass it .
" small step for mankind " however , the us president 's speech did n't convince many european officials who remained skeptical that the conference hosted by bush at the state department would help key un climate talks in bali in december .
the bali talks will aim to launch a successor to the kyoto protocol which sets limits on industrial nations ' emissions and which expires in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was not in a conciliatory mood " this here was a great step for the americans and a small step for mankind , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told journalists in washington .
" in substance , we are still far apart . "
bush 's emphasis on voluntary approaches rather than the firm targets pushed by many european countries also raised a few eyebrows .
a long-term goal for reducing global warming was needed , bush said , but added that " each nation will design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this . "
" one of the striking features of this meeting is how isolated this administration has become .
there is absolutely no support that i can see in the international community that we can drive this effort on the basis of voluntary efforts , " john ashton , a special representative on climate change for the british foreign secretary , said in an interview . " i do n't think that this meeting by itself moves the ball very much at all .
the much more significant meeting this week was at the un where there was a sense of urgency . "
criticism at odds with merkel 's statements bush 's proposal to expand nuclear energy to fight climate change and his statement that carbon dioxide emissions would be much higher today if it were n't for the 439 nuclear power plants worldwide was sharply criticised by germany 's gabriel .
" i do n't it 's particularly clever to give the world the message : build new nuclear plants , " gabriel said .
" first you urge people to expand nuclear energy and then you send in nato to bomb the nuclear power plants because they did the wrong thing - that is n't particularly intelligent politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was full of praise for bush 's initiative on climate change gabriel 's combativeness is in sharp contrast to chancellor angela merkel 's statements on us climate policy .
earlier this week at the sidelines of the un assembly in new york , merkel welcomed bush 's invitation to the world 's 16 worst polluters for climate talks .

" in the first case of its kind in germany , a man went on trial this week in the northern city of celle for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists . the 36-year-old iraqi-born kurdish defendant , known as ibrahim r. , is accused of using the internet as a " terror weapon " and conducting his own " personal jihad on the computer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials observed the defendant 's internet habits for 18 months the defendant , who was under observation by security officials for a year and a half , also faces charges of attempting to recruit members and supporters for two terrorist networks , al qaeda and " al qaeda in iraq . " peter ernst , the main prosecutor in the case , said the " main propaganda path for al qaeda is the internet , where jihad is also carried out virtually . " " virtual supermarket for terrorists " federal prosecutors said the defendant , who was arrested last october and has been jailed pending trial ever since , spent hours surfing the internet and logged on in the chatroom under seven different pseudonyms . the audio and video files he downloaded from the internet and posted in the chatroom contained messages by bin laden and abu musab al-sarkawi , the now dead leader of al qaeda in iraq , and include the justification of terrorist attacks and incitement of hatred against jews .
the defendant himself occasionally appealed for participation in jihad , or holy war , prosecutors added . the case , experts say , underscores the increasing significance of the role of the internet in global terrorism .
known to offer everything from sources of terror financing , the sale of chemicals and fertilizers , recruitment of members , to a complete terrorist attack how-to guide , monitoring the web has long been high on counter-terrorism experts ' list . " this trial is a milestone in terms of fighting terrorism on the internet and will be watched closely , " said rolf tophoven , director of the essen-based institute for terrorism research and security policy .
" the internet today has become a virtual supermarket for terrorists , where they can find everything they need to prepare for attacks . " new legal ground ? yet , the " cyber jihadist " case also raises questions about what constitutes terrorism , and reflects germany 's struggle to deal with new threats with the right legal tools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the sept .

11 , 2001 , suicide pilots had lived in hamburg .
it started by , among other things , making membership in a foreign terror group a crime .
more recently , the foiling of potentially deadly bombings has german politicians pushing for stricter anti-terror legislation to criminalize training for an attack or obtaining weapons or other substances in order to carry out an attack . but the present case in celle covers new legal ground , according to klaus rüther , ibrahim r. 's lawyer , because the defendant is solely charged with actions on the internet . " this is about distributing speeches online by members of terrorist groups , and not something like building bombs , buying a ticket to pakistan or funding radical groups , " rüther said , adding there was a difference between general propaganda for al qaeda and targeted recruiting of members and supporters . some of the speeches by bin laden were broadcast on the arab tv network al jazeera he said , adding that anyone could have seen them if they wanted to . downloading such video clips and passing them on to others is legal in germany , rüther said , adding that the case risked putting the german justice system on a slippery slope that could lead to " criminal law being broadened to cover laws on political convictions . " hard to make a case experts agree that prosecutors will have a tough time making a case , because they will have to prove that ibrahim r. had intentions to plan attacks or recruit new members for al qaeda through the online distribution of hate material and terrorist propaganda . " did the defendant do more than simply view bin laden recordings and pass them on ?
why did he do it ? " asked tophoven .
" that will be the decisive point in the trial . " bernd carstensen , press spokesman for germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- pointed out that merely sympathizing with terrorist groups was no longer a crime in germany . " simply distributing terrorist propaganda no longer suffices in germany for a prosecution , " carstensen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until 2003 , sporting a bin laden sticker would have been illegal in germany sympathizing with terror groups or distributing propaganda was made a punishable offence under section 129a of germany 's penal code in the 1970s , when attacks by groups like the red army faction sparked widespread terrorism fears across the country .
that included writings , pamphlets , posters , t-shirts that showed common cause with left-wing terrorist movements . but , in 2003 , the green party decriminalized it when they shared power with the social democrats in the federal government .
earlier this year , in keeping with the liberalized law , germany 's federal administrative court ruled that general calls for jihad were no longer punishable as propaganda for a terrorist group . a deterrent to " virtual jihad " " it 's an important trial because it will shed light on whether what happens in closed chat groups on the internet falls under freedom of expression or whether you can penalize it if there 's proof of planned attacks , " said carstensen . whatever the outcome of the " cyber jihadist " trial , some say it will set a precedent .
tophoven said the trial would be an important step in countering " virtual jihad . " " it will act as a deterrent for future internet users toying with the idea of playing terrorist .

27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .

" with this decision , the high quality of german air , in principle , is assured , " matthias machnig , the government 's assistant environment secretary , said in berlin .
jürgen resch , the chief of the german environmental help agency , called the decision " a breakthrough in the fight against air pollution . "

german carmakers already face a potential new eu law which would require new cars to have average co2 emissions of 120 grams per kilometer .
german carmakers are expected to be hit especially hard by the new regulation : producers of luxury vehicles , such as porsche , daimler , bmw and audi , far exceed the emissions target and lag behind when it comes to hybrid technology that 's been pushed by companies such as toyota and honda .

in january , a squabble between russia and belarus temporarily disrupted supplies headed towards western europe and past disputes over gas with ukraine have had similar consequences .
the belarus disruption convinced european politicians they needed to develop a new and united energy strategy that would help overcome the bloc 's members ' worries about sovereignty issues .
on wednesday , sept .
26 , the european parliament passed a resolution approving a special representative who will be tasked with negotiating energy issues with provider countries such as russia .
speaking with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing many interests this so-called " mr. energy , " as eu politicians have referred to the new delegate , will represent the common interests of europe and give the 27-member bloc a united front in dealing with exporters .
additionally , " mr. energy " will work to prevent a future crisis which could be caused , for example , by a long-term disruption in russian gas or oil .
in the case of a supply shortfall , the representative would develop an internal eu solidarity mechanism .
polish christian democrat jacek saryusz-wolski , currently head of the eu foreign affairs committee , authored the resolution .
a total of 553 parliamentarians voted for the idea while 103 voted against it and 27 abstained .
" this is a new starting point for a united foreign policy of the union , " saryusz-wolski said .
no more baby steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to prevent shortages " the european energy policy is no longer in its infancy , " said kristina notz , an expert in energy policy for the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich .
" we 've at last arrived at the implementation phase .
the basics have been clarified , now the question is the details . "
those details are on the mind of ferran tarradellas espuny , spokesman for energy commissioner andris piebalgs about parliamentary resolution .
" mr. energy " needs his responsibilities to be clearly outlined , which is missing from the current proposal , tarradellas espuny said . whether the energy representative should focus on gas or oil prices , the role of diversification of energy sources and what to do if a crisis occurs , were among the issues tarradellas espuny said still needed to be addressed .
poland wants energy solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connected and coordinated : europe 's future energy regime poland was a vocal proponent of including a solidarity clause in the eu legislation .
the country depends on russian gas and oil for about 90 percent of its energy imports and also serves as transit country for energy headed further west .
a solidarity clause would help poland in case of an interruption in its supply from russia .
but poland has been criticized for pushing energy solidarity while remaining opposed to other eu initiatives , such as the current attempt to reform the eu charter and its past opposition to the eu negotiating energy issues with russia over domestic trade issues .
diversification remains fundamental bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe looks towards sun and wind alternatives europe has realized it needs to diversify .
officials have called for both increasing the use of alternative energies , including such as solar and wind energy , as well as finding new sources for oil and gas .
norway and algeria are among the eu 's current favorites .
norway currently provides about 15 percent of the eu 's oil requirements .
on thursday , the country announced it would increase its exports from 55 billion to 78 billion cubic meters -lrb- 72 billion to 102 billion cubic yards -rrb- in 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.09.2007 eu says airlines must cut carbon dioxide emissions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants airlines too to contribute to the fight against climate change the eu has reaffirmed a controversial plan to force airlines using european airspace to cut greenhouse gas emissions despite opposition from both the aviation industry and the us . the european union on friday said it would stick to a plan to include airlines in its overall strategy to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .
the plan also has the airline industry up in arms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are resisting following energy companies into joining europe 's carbon emissions trading scheme giovanni bisigani , director general and ceo of the geneva-based international air transport association or iata , which represents 250 airlines around the world , said the eu 's approach was " disappointing and irresponsible . "
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .

the plan would require airlines using european airspace to trade carbon permits , forcing them to buy more if they want to add more flights .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said that in the fight against climate change " all sectors must contribute in a fair way , including aviation , whose emissions are increasing very rapidly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting climate change has to include cleaner skies , the eu says eu officials criticized the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- for not enacting stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards for international air traffic .
" we strongly believe it would be best if the international community could reach an effective mechanism on tackling aviation emissions , " said luis fonseca de almeida , head of portugal 's civil aviation authority .
portugal currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
after an icao meeting in montreal ended without a promise to aim for cutting aviation emissions , fonseca de almeida said the organization had " abdicated the leadership role given to in the kyoto " protocol .
us , airline industry opposed to plan the plan however faces stiff opposition from the united states which believes the eu has no right to force airlines using european airspace to participate in the bloc 's emissions caps program .
washington says it prefers a voluntary agreement among nations .
the dispute may turn into an global trade fight as the united states said the eu had no legal authority to include foreign airlines in its environment plans , c. boyden gray , us ambassador to the eu told reporters on tuesday .
the plan also has the airline industry up in arms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are resisting following energy companies into joining europe 's carbon emissions trading scheme giovanni bisigani , director general and ceo of the geneva-based international air transport association or iata , which represents 250 airlines around the world , said the eu 's approach was " disappointing and irresponsible . "
" europe 's unilateral approach to emissions trading confuses taking leadership into taking cash , " bisigani said in a statement .
" regional schemes will have , at best , limited impact on the environment . "
munich , frankfurt to have emission-linked fees meanwhile , germany 's two main airports said this week that airlines will be rewarded for flying lower emission planes into munich and frankfurt airports beginning in 2008 .
" flying will become cleaner and easier on the environment , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said in berlin , adding that the project will give airlines " incentives to use modern and environmentally friendlier airplanes . "
the minister and airport authorities said they hoped other german airports would voluntary decide to join in applying the new rules , which will initially be put in place for three years .
munich and frankfurt airports are responsible for about half of german air traffic .
airports in switzerland , sweden and great britain currently have similar fee structures that take emissions into account .
fees not a revenue device the new rules will means that 32 percent of landing and take-off fees will be climate related , according to wilhelm bender , chief executive of fraport , which runs frankfurt international airport .

27 , overruled munich 's city administration in favor of the plaintiff dieter janecek in a case where the munich resident held his local council responsible for the quality of the air he breathes .
janecek , who lives on the busy landshuter allee in the bavarian capital , began court proceedings against the city of munich after complaining about the high levels of dust and fuel pollution in the air outside his home on the highly trafficked street .
while the court 's decision included a clause that the city of munich must take pollution analysis samples from outside janecek 's apartment before taking the necessary action , the plaintiff hailed the ruling as a complete victory .
" now every affected person across the country can sue for his right to breathe clean air , " janecek said in a statement outside the court in leipzig .
the court ruling will force local authorities to draw up action plans to provide clean air and be ready to choose from a number of measures in the case of an inhabitant demanding action .
possible contributions to healthcare costs these could range from decreasing , diverting or banning traffic from the affected area , to contributing to the inhabitant 's healthcare costs from 2005 onwards , depending on the level of pollution and the effect it has had on the environment and people .
the eu passed a law which set a safe and acceptable level of air pollution for all member states in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : councils could pay for treatment of pollution-related illnesses the federal ministry of the environment and other conservation organizations praised the ruling .
" with this decision , the high quality of german air , in principle , is assured , " matthias machnig , the government 's assistant environment secretary , said in berlin .
jürgen resch , the chief of the german environmental help agency , called the decision " a breakthrough in the fight against air pollution . "
more bad news for automotive industry ?
meanwhile richard mergner of the alliance for nature conservation in bavaria said that he expected the court 's decision to have a knock-on effect in the german automotive industry .
german carmakers already face a potential new eu law which would require new cars to have average co2 emissions of 120 grams per kilometer .
german carmakers are expected to be hit especially hard by the new regulation : producers of luxury vehicles , such as porsche , daimler , bmw and audi , far exceed the emissions target and lag behind when it comes to hybrid technology that 's been pushed by companies such as toyota and honda .
a nationwide spate of cases against local authorities over the quality of air may force the german government to take its own action against polluters to avoid a slide into environmental litigiousness . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in january , a squabble between russia and belarus temporarily disrupted supplies headed towards western europe and past disputes over gas with ukraine have had similar consequences .
the belarus disruption convinced european politicians they needed to develop a new and united energy strategy that would help overcome the bloc 's members ' worries about sovereignty issues .
on wednesday , sept .
26 , the european parliament passed a resolution approving a special representative who will be tasked with negotiating energy issues with provider countries such as russia .
speaking with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing many interests this so-called " mr. energy , " as eu politicians have referred to the new delegate , will represent the common interests of europe and give the 27-member bloc a united front in dealing with exporters .
additionally , " mr. energy " will work to prevent a future crisis which could be caused , for example , by a long-term disruption in russian gas or oil .
in the case of a supply shortfall , the representative would develop an internal eu solidarity mechanism .
polish christian democrat jacek saryusz-wolski , currently head of the eu foreign affairs committee , authored the resolution .
a total of 553 parliamentarians voted for the idea while 103 voted against it and 27 abstained .
" this is a new starting point for a united foreign policy of the union , " saryusz-wolski said .
no more baby steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to prevent shortages " the european energy policy is no longer in its infancy , " said kristina notz , an expert in energy policy for the center for applied policy research -lrb- cap -rrb- in munich .
" we 've at last arrived at the implementation phase .
the basics have been clarified , now the question is the details . "
those details are on the mind of ferran tarradellas espuny , spokesman for energy commissioner andris piebalgs about parliamentary resolution .
" mr. energy " needs his responsibilities to be clearly outlined , which is missing from the current proposal , tarradellas espuny said . whether the energy representative should focus on gas or oil prices , the role of diversification of energy sources and what to do if a crisis occurs , were among the issues tarradellas espuny said still needed to be addressed .
poland wants energy solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connected and coordinated : europe 's future energy regime poland was a vocal proponent of including a solidarity clause in the eu legislation .
the country depends on russian gas and oil for about 90 percent of its energy imports and also serves as transit country for energy headed further west .
a solidarity clause would help poland in case of an interruption in its supply from russia .
but poland has been criticized for pushing energy solidarity while remaining opposed to other eu initiatives , such as the current attempt to reform the eu charter and its past opposition to the eu negotiating energy issues with russia over domestic trade issues .
diversification remains fundamental bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe looks towards sun and wind alternatives europe has realized it needs to diversify .
officials have called for both increasing the use of alternative energies , including such as solar and wind energy , as well as finding new sources for oil and gas .
norway and algeria are among the eu 's current favorites .
norway currently provides about 15 percent of the eu 's oil requirements .
on thursday , the country announced it would increase its exports from 55 billion to 78 billion cubic meters -lrb- 72 billion to 102 billion cubic yards -rrb- in 2010 .

calder hall in cumbria was opened by the queen in 1956 , but ceased operating in 2003 after almost 50 years .
its four cooling towers are due to be demolished on saturday in a programme to decommission ageing nuclear sites .
the nuclear decommissioning authority -lrb- nda -rrb- says a proposed museum has now been ruled out because of the cost .
the nda had been considering preserving one of calder hall 's reactors and using it as the basis for a state-of-the-art visitor attraction .
significant support the ambitious plan for a museum was seen as a way of enhancing the visitor centre which already exists at sellafield .
but a study , commissioned by the nda and carried out by surrey-based consultancy atkins , said the project would cost at least £ 128m .
the nda has been unable to gather significant support for the project from the private sector or local authorities in the area .
a spokesman for the nda said : " a feasibility study found that preserving calder hall reactor 1 and creating a museum on the site was possible .
" but the cost involved would be significant , with estimates putting it at around £ 128m .
" given the nda 's priorities of tackling high hazards and decommissioning , alternative funding would need to be identified for this project to progress . "

the coal exchange , built between 1883 and 1886 , is believed to be where the first recorded £ 1m deal was struck .
once earmarked as a future home of the welsh assembly , the wood-panelled hall has been a popular music venue .
the £ 20m redevelopment will include apartments , offices , shops and bars but it is unclear whether the hall will be used for gigs when it reopens in 2009 .
the building 's owners macob have said it may still maintain the main hall to hold public events but according to local reports it is unlikely the venue will play host to music shows .

coal merchants chalked up the changing prices of coal on slates outside their offices or struck deals in the local public houses .
following its opening , coal owners , ship owners and their agents met daily on the floor of the trading hall where agreements were made by word-of-mouth and where a novelty , the telephone , was available .

it was thought that up to 10,000 people would go in and out of the building each day .
there was much excitement in 1904 when the world 's first recorded million pound deal was struck at the exchange .
at one time the price of the world 's coal was determined here .

its famous title sequence - with lead character tony soprano driving on a new jersey freeway - uses the group 's song woke up this morning .
the sixth and final series of the drama is being shown in britain on e4 .
welsh singer rob spragg , from nelson , caerphilly , said they were " blessed " to be associated with the series .
spragg , better known as larry love , said sopranos writer and creator david chase was making the same journey as tony soprano when he first heard the track .
he told bbc radio wales : " initially i think david was going to have different songs for each episode but he heard our track and said " this is the one " .
" he did n't know who we were .
he just heard the band was called alabama 3 which seemed to create some confusion . "
some people ask if it is a blessing or a curse but we are very proud to be associated with the sopranos .
it is a quality programme " rob spragg , aka larry love " initially they thought we must be from alabama , then they thought we were four kids from san francisco although the best theory was that we were three young black lads from the bronx !
" then of course he found out we were actually a welshman and a scotsman living in brixton , london , pretending that we were from alabama ! "
spragg formed alabama 3 in the early ' 90s with his aforementioned scottish friend jake black , otherwise known as the very rev dr d wayne love , when they decided it might be interesting to sing hank williams songs over the top of detroit techno beats .
their innovative fusion of styles , ironic , sometimes political lyrics and the creation of personas have made them especially popular on the live circuit .
the band has also now swollen to nine members .
" it is like country and western meets techno with american accents by a welshman and a scotsman .
" it looks ridiculous on paper but it kind of works over a course of time . "
" each member of the band brings something unique - the drummer is very much into his techno , the guitarist loves his delta blues , the piano player is a mad honky-tonk weirdo . "
some of the band 's influences and attitudes could well have come from spragg 's upbringing in the south wales valleys town of merthyr tydfil .
he lived with his aunt shirley on the top of dowlais before moving to cyfarthfa .
he attended school in troedyrhiw and then moved to aberystwyth .
spragg was also raised as a mormon and said the bishop used to let him and his friends practice their musical skills in the local chapel .
punk rock " little did he know i would end up 10 years later selling my soul at the crossroads to the other fella ! " he said .
" in terms of influences i had a strange background in the sense that music was not really allowed in the house unless it was the osmonds .
so for a while it was them or the mormon tabernacle choir .
" but from there i discovered the evils of punk rock .
i used to be into black sabbath , zeppelin , the stones and stuff like that . "
in addition to saying goodbye to the sopranos , the band are also to bring the curtain down on one of cardiff 's best-loved music venues , the coal exchange , on friday .
the site is being developed into apartments , offices , shops and bars and it is unclear whether the hall will be used for gigs when it reopens in 2009 .
so although he is sad to see the venue go , spragg has promised a goodbye to remember .
he said : " we are going to raise up the ghosts in the room that night . "

its famous title sequence - with lead character tony soprano driving on a new jersey freeway - uses the group 's song woke up this morning .
the sixth and final series of the drama is being shown in britain on e4 .
welsh singer rob spragg , from nelson , caerphilly , said they were " blessed " to be associated with the series .
spragg , better known as larry love , said sopranos writer and creator david chase was making the same journey as tony soprano when he first heard the track .
he told bbc radio wales : " initially i think david was going to have different songs for each episode but he heard our track and said " this is the one " .
" he did n't know who we were .
he just heard the band was called alabama 3 which seemed to create some confusion .
some people ask if it is a blessing or a curse but we are very proud to be associated with the sopranos .
it is a quality programme rob spragg , aka larry love " initially they thought we must be from alabama , then they thought we were four kids from san francisco although the best theory was that we were three young black lads from the bronx !
" then of course he found out we were actually a welshman and a scotsman living in brixton , london , pretending that we were from alabama ! "
spragg formed alabama 3 in the early ' 90s with his aforementioned scottish friend jake black , otherwise known as the very rev dr d wayne love , when they decided it might be interesting to sing hank williams songs over the top of detroit techno beats .
their innovative fusion of styles , ironic , sometimes political lyrics and the creation of personas have made them especially popular on the live circuit .
the band has also now swollen to nine members .
" it is like country and western meets techno with american accents by a welshman and a scotsman .
" it looks ridiculous on paper but it kind of works over a course of time . "
spragg was raised a mormon in the south wales valleys " each member of the band brings something unique - the drummer is very much into his techno , the guitarist loves his delta blues , the piano player is a mad honky-tonk weirdo . "
some of the band 's influences and attitudes could well have come from spragg 's upbringing in the south wales valleys town of merthyr tydfil .
he lived with his aunt shirley on the top of dowlais before moving to cyfarthfa .
he attended school in troedyrhiw and then moved to aberystwyth .
spragg was also raised as a mormon and said the bishop used to let him and his friends practice their musical skills in the local chapel .
punk rock " little did he know i would end up 10 years later selling my soul at the crossroads to the other fella ! " he said .
" in terms of influences i had a strange background in the sense that music was not really allowed in the house unless it was the osmonds .
so for a while it was them or the mormon tabernacle choir .
" but from there i discovered the evils of punk rock .
i used to be into black sabbath , zeppelin , the stones and stuff like that . "

at home , " record " buttons are pressed , battered c-90 cassettes whirr , and if mum tries to serve tea before seven o 'clock , she is in big trouble .
" the top 40 was the absolute flagship show , " says former host richard skinner .
" at the time , it was claimed as the most listened-to show in europe .
i do n't know how we calculated that , but we certainly used to say it . "
he says that to listen in stereo - when radio 1 did not have its own fm frequencies - made it " sound even more important " and provided " an extra sparkle " .
' dominant ' position " fluff " freeman hosted pick of the pops for radio 1 's first five years the show began as pick of the pops on the light programme in 1955 , with alan " fluff " freeman hosting throughout the 1960s .
but the launch of radio 1 , 40 years ago this sunday , saw its duration double to two hours , and the start switched to five o 'clock .
" younger people now perhaps would n't appreciate just how dominant it was , " says david jensen , who in 1984 would launch the rival network chart , which combined sales and airplay .
jensen says his move to commercial radio came " at a good time " because radio 1 wanted him and colleague john peel , both presenters on weekday evenings , to swap slots .
" neither of us was particularly happy about this , and we had long , fraught discussions about what would happen , " he says .
skinner admits radio 1 was " arrogant " in those days and " genuinely thought there was no competition " .
goodier gave up when chart shows were " all people thought i could do " " we used to say things like , ' well , is n't it marvellous - there 's david jensen playing the same records in a different order . '

two djs who became synonymous with the radio 1 chart were bruno brookes and mark goodier .
brookes hosted from 1984 to 1990 and was replaced by goodier for 18 months , before returning in 1992 .
brookes calls the programme " a milestone " in his career , which he tried to make as " energetic " as possible .
" it was important to give equilibrium in terms of the excitement to all acts or bands .
i thought it was only fair . "
goodier says he had " a bit of a problem " with being taken off the show in 1992 , when bosses insisted he could not present the top 40 and new music show the evening session .
capital radio recruited david " kid " jensen to host its network chart " i said , ' i can , because i 've been playing all these new bands , and when they get in the chart , that 's a validation of what we 've done . " '
he returned to the slot between 1994 and 2002 .
goodier admits there was " definitely " rivalry between him and brookes .
" i think he was a very good jock and had a very big fan base .
" i came about it from music , and i think he came about it from showbiz , and did it really well .
i 've no criticism of him . "
changing format commercial radio capitalised on unsettled times at radio 1 in the mid-1990s , when controversial changes meant the departure of several veteran djs .
we played the jingle and i said , ' oh , hang on a second , i have n't put the record on ' richard skinner on the chart show he would rather forget " we were a personality chart that was a really fun show , with competitions , interviews with the stars making the hits and montage recaps , " says neil fox , who took over the network chart in 1993 .
" if you listen to jk and joel on radio 1 now , it 's everything the pepsi chart was 10 years ago . "
the audience for the commercial radio chart would eventually overtake radio 1 , something which goodier regrets .
" there was a very sad era when the chart was not a priority for radio 1 , and they did consider taking it off , " he says .
neil fox says commercial radio was happy to " champion " his chart " they opened the door to the commercial radio chart gaining in strength .

however , fox admits he is not a fan of hit40uk , the show which has replaced his .
" they ruined the whole thing .
they thought they needed to change for the sake of it , and radio 1 now has the biggest chart again . "
on-air mistakes of course , things could go wrong on such a high-pressure programme .
an error with madonna 's vogue led to brookes drowning his sorrows skinner - who once edited sister sledge 's hit frankie down to less than two minutes for the countdown because he hated it so much - recalls introducing black lace while their single was still in its sleeve .
" we played the jingle and i said , ' oh , hang on a second , i have n't put the record on . '
i got the record , threw the stylus on and it started at once - god obviously loves black lace . "
brookes once accidentally included the expletive-laden unedited version of rage against the machine 's killing in the name on the show .

millions of people have retuned their radios from crackly medium wave to crystal-clear fm .
radio 2 's sing something simple gives way to the pips , and the top 40 explodes into life on radio 1 .
at home , " record " buttons are pressed , battered c-90 cassettes whirr , and if mum tries to serve tea before seven o 'clock , she is in big trouble .
" the top 40 was the absolute flagship show , " says former host richard skinner .
" at the time , it was claimed as the most listened-to show in europe .
i do n't know how we calculated that , but we certainly used to say it . "
he says that to listen in stereo - when radio 1 did not have its own fm frequencies - made it " sound even more important " and provided " an extra sparkle " .
' dominant ' position " fluff " freeman hosted pick of the pops for radio 1 's first five years the show began as pick of the pops on the light programme in 1955 , with alan " fluff " freeman hosting throughout the 1960s .
but the launch of radio 1 , 40 years ago this sunday , saw its duration double to two hours , and the start switched to five o 'clock .
" younger people now perhaps would n't appreciate just how dominant it was , " says david jensen , who in 1984 would launch the rival network chart , which combined sales and airplay .
jensen says his move to commercial radio came " at a good time " because radio 1 wanted him and colleague john peel , both presenters on weekday evenings , to swap slots .
" neither of us was particularly happy about this , and we had long , fraught discussions about what would happen , " he says .
skinner admits radio 1 was " arrogant " in those days and " genuinely thought there was no competition " .
goodier gave up when chart shows were " all people thought i could do " " we used to say things like , ' well , is n't it marvellous - there 's david jensen playing the same records in a different order . '
but clearly what he was doing was the beginning of a change . "
two djs who became synonymous with the radio 1 chart were bruno brookes and mark goodier .
brookes hosted from 1984 to 1990 and was replaced by goodier for 18 months , before returning in 1992 .
brookes calls the programme " a milestone " in his career , which he tried to make as " energetic " as possible .
" it was important to give equilibrium in terms of the excitement to all acts or bands .
i thought it was only fair . "
goodier says he had " a bit of a problem " with being taken off the show in 1992 , when bosses insisted he could not present the top 40 and new music show the evening session .
capital radio recruited david " kid " jensen to host its network chart " i said , ' i can , because i 've been playing all these new bands , and when they get in the chart , that 's a validation of what we 've done . " '
he returned to the slot between 1994 and 2002 .
goodier admits there was " definitely " rivalry between him and brookes .
" i think he was a very good jock and had a very big fan base .
" i came about it from music , and i think he came about it from showbiz , and did it really well .
i 've no criticism of him . "
changing format commercial radio capitalised on unsettled times at radio 1 in the mid-1990s , when controversial changes meant the departure of several veteran djs .
we played the jingle and i said , ' oh , hang on a second , i have n't put the record on ' richard skinner on the chart show he would rather forget " we were a personality chart that was a really fun show , with competitions , interviews with the stars making the hits and montage recaps , " says neil fox , who took over the network chart in 1993 .
" if you listen to jk and joel on radio 1 now , it 's everything the pepsi chart was 10 years ago . "
the audience for the commercial radio chart would eventually overtake radio 1 , something which goodier regrets .
" there was a very sad era when the chart was not a priority for radio 1 , and they did consider taking it off , " he says .
neil fox says commercial radio was happy to " champion " his chart " they opened the door to the commercial radio chart gaining in strength .
in the end it was on more than 100 stations . "
however , fox admits he is not a fan of hit40uk , the show which has replaced his .
" they ruined the whole thing .
they thought they needed to change for the sake of it , and radio 1 now has the biggest chart again . "
on-air mistakes of course , things could go wrong on such a high-pressure programme .
an error with madonna 's vogue led to brookes drowning his sorrows skinner - who once edited sister sledge 's hit frankie down to less than two minutes for the countdown because he hated it so much - recalls introducing black lace while their single was still in its sleeve .
" we played the jingle and i said , ' oh , hang on a second , i have n't put the record on . '
i got the record , threw the stylus on and it started at once - god obviously loves black lace . "
brookes once accidentally included the expletive-laden unedited version of rage against the machine 's killing in the name on the show .
but something else which " sticks out like a sore thumb " for him was playing one chart-topper - vogue by madonna - a song too early .
" i had to get to the pips at seven o 'clock with the number two song .
it was so embarrassing that me and my producer went round the pub and got drunk . "

" the top 40 was the absolute flagship show , " says former host richard skinner .
" at the time , it was claimed as the most listened-to show in europe .
i do n't know how we calculated that , but we certainly used to say it . "
he says that to listen in stereo - when radio 1 did not have its own fm frequencies - made it " sound even more important " and provided " an extra sparkle " .
' dominant ' position " fluff " freeman hosted pick of the pops for radio 1 's first five years the show began as pick of the pops on the light programme in 1955 , with alan " fluff " freeman hosting throughout the 1960s .
but the launch of radio 1 , 40 years ago this sunday , saw its duration double to two hours , and the start switched to five o 'clock .
" younger people now perhaps would n't appreciate just how dominant it was , " says david jensen , who in 1984 would launch the rival network chart , which combined sales and airplay .
jensen says his move to commercial radio came " at a good time " because radio 1 wanted him and colleague john peel , both presenters on weekday evenings , to swap slots .
" neither of us was particularly happy about this , and we had long , fraught discussions about what would happen , " he says .
skinner admits radio 1 was " arrogant " in those days and " genuinely thought there was no competition " .
goodier gave up when chart shows were " all people thought i could do " " we used to say things like , ' well , is n't it marvellous - there 's david jensen playing the same records in a different order . '
but clearly what he was doing was the beginning of a change . "
two djs who became synonymous with the radio 1 chart were bruno brookes and mark goodier .
brookes hosted from 1984 to 1990 and was replaced by goodier for 18 months , before returning in 1992 .
brookes calls the programme " a milestone " in his career , which he tried to make as " energetic " as possible .
" it was important to give equilibrium in terms of the excitement to all acts or bands .
i thought it was only fair . "
goodier says he had " a bit of a problem " with being taken off the show in 1992 , when bosses insisted he could not present the top 40 and new music show the evening session .
capital radio recruited david " kid " jensen to host its network chart " i said , ' i can , because i 've been playing all these new bands , and when they get in the chart , that 's a validation of what we 've done . " '
he returned to the slot between 1994 and 2002 .
goodier admits there was " definitely " rivalry between him and brookes .
" i think he was a very good jock and had a very big fan base .
" i came about it from music , and i think he came about it from showbiz , and did it really well .
i 've no criticism of him . "
changing format commercial radio capitalised on unsettled times at radio 1 in the mid-1990s , when controversial changes meant the departure of several veteran djs .

" if you listen to jk and joel on radio 1 now , it 's everything the pepsi chart was 10 years ago . "
the audience for the commercial radio chart would eventually overtake radio 1 , something which goodier regrets .
" there was a very sad era when the chart was not a priority for radio 1 , and they did consider taking it off , " he says .
neil fox says commercial radio was happy to " champion " his chart " they opened the door to the commercial radio chart gaining in strength .
in the end it was on more than 100 stations . "
however , fox admits he is not a fan of hit40uk , the show which has replaced his .
" they ruined the whole thing .
they thought they needed to change for the sake of it , and radio 1 now has the biggest chart again . "
on-air mistakes of course , things could go wrong on such a high-pressure programme .
an error with madonna 's vogue led to brookes drowning his sorrows skinner - who once edited sister sledge 's hit frankie down to less than two minutes for the countdown because he hated it so much - recalls introducing black lace while their single was still in its sleeve .
" we played the jingle and i said , ' oh , hang on a second , i have n't put the record on . '
i got the record , threw the stylus on and it started at once - god obviously loves black lace . "
brookes once accidentally included the expletive-laden unedited version of rage against the machine 's killing in the name on the show .
but something else which " sticks out like a sore thumb " for him was playing one chart-topper - vogue by madonna - a song too early .
" i had to get to the pips at seven o 'clock with the number two song .
it was so embarrassing that me and my producer went round the pub and got drunk . "

by kevin young entertainment reporter , bbc news new technologies and changing habits mean the way people listen to the radio has been revolutionised in recent years .
a week of articles on the 40th birthdays of radios 1 to 4 concludes by asking leading industry figures how they believe radio is shaping up for the next four decades .
the days of families gathering around a huge radio to enjoy an evening of entertainment passed long ago .
now , you do not even need to own a set to hear programmes - mobile phones and mp3 players come equipped with tuners while stations are available through tvs on set-top boxes .
and on-demand services and podcasts offer a way to listen when it suits , rather than following a schedule .
" the power being in the hands of the audience to dictate when they 're going to listen to something will get bigger and bigger , " says radio 2 controller lesley douglas .
" but i think the tipping point is further away than people think .
for the foreseeable future , i think listening will be driven by tuning in to , say , terry wogan because he 's on at breakfast . "
' scattered ' listening ralph bernard , chief executive of gcap media , thinks it will become natural to pause and rewind live programmes , " particularly when the phone goes " .
" if my wife is listening to the archers , it is absolutely natural for her to hit the ' pause ' button - a feature you just do n't get with ordinary analogue radio . "
" i can have a podcast channel and let 's imagine i decide the next episode will be a pdf file .
that could include audio , video , text - whatever i like " dean whitbread uk podcasters association but while mark goodier , the ex-radio 1 dj who is currently at smooth radio in london , is sure radio will become more " timeshifted " , he does not think this is necessarily progress .
" i 'm hoping that in 10 years ' time , people will have rediscovered the joys of making an appointment to listen .
the successful stations will be the ones that achieve that . "
he believes that having " lots of content that people grab " will make it hard for broadcasters to accurately measure ratings , and could even threaten their financial futures .
" how do you justify millions of pounds a year for radio 2 if it 's all over the place , and for commercial radio , how do you sell -lsb- advertising -rsb- if listening is scattered ? "
podcasting the bbc and other broadcasters now issue effectively programme highlights as podcasts - audio files which can be downloaded on to computers or portable music devices .
but this particular format is at its best pushing the boundaries of " traditional radio " , according to dean whitbread , who chairs the uk podcasters association .
" podcasts can really do or be anything , " he says .
" i can have a podcast channel and let 's imagine i decide the next episode will be a pdf file .
that could include audio , video , text - whatever i like . "
such extras can help to " put visuals into radio " , mr whitbread adds , which is an " interesting and exciting " prospect .
" i definitely think you can enrich and enhance the radio listening experience , " says nathalie schwarz , director of channel 4 radio .
" at its most basic , it 's by adding an electronic programme guide for radio , which we take for granted in television now but has n't happened in radio at all , really . "
she stresses the addition of images must be done " sensitively and intelligently " and without turning radio into " tv lite " .
however , bbc radio 4 controller mark damazer warns that caution is needed in this area , because audiences will only tolerate " a genuinely rewarding add-on " .
" if you shoved a single camera into the in our time studio , suddenly having that as a ' tv thing ' is not going to work , " he says .
" it will just destroy its magic . "
he remembers a tv run for radio 4 's comedy quiz just a minute which " was n't the same " , and says he " remains nervous of what you do to the alchemy of a programme if you throw too much technology at it " .
changing the rules elsewhere , commercial broadcasters are keen for ofcom to loosen restrictions they face in areas such as networking and formats .
strict rules determine the amount of programming which a company can simulcast across its different stations , and its ability to alter the style of music played , or the ratio of songs to speech .
" commercial radio needs a bit more freedom in its formats to be able to change quickly , " believes john myers , chief executive of gmg radio .
" there 's only one industry in the uk which is regulated as much as commercial radio and that 's the nuclear industry , " he says .
andrew harrison , who flies the flag for commercial stations as chief executive of industry body the radio company , calls these rules " a throwback to an age when radio was the only national communication device and spectrum was scarce " .
" those days are now gone and we 're competing and fighting for revenue against national television , the press , the internet and digital in all its forms .
" there 's big scope to relax some of the regulation on localness , formats and ownership , which is holding the sector back . "
but mr myers believes radio will remain enormously popular " because of its pure , intrinsic entertainment value " .
" it 's a mass medium , it 's a very popular medium and it 's a mobile medium .
you might be listening to it on a range of platforms - your mobile phone , your wristwatch , your headset - but it is probably the one medium that will survive . "

such extras can help to " put visuals into radio " , mr whitbread adds , which is an " interesting and exciting " prospect .
" i definitely think you can enrich and enhance the radio listening experience , " says nathalie schwarz , director of channel 4 radio .
" at its most basic , it 's by adding an electronic programme guide for radio , which we take for granted in television now but has n't happened in radio at all , really . "
she stresses the addition of images must be done " sensitively and intelligently " and without turning radio into " tv lite " .

" commercial radio needs a bit more freedom in its formats to be able to change quickly , " believes john myers , chief executive of gmg radio .
commercial stations face tough rules on formats and networking " there 's only one industry in the uk which is regulated as much as commercial radio and that 's the nuclear industry , " he says .
andrew harrison , who flies the flag for commercial stations as chief executive of industry body the radio company , calls these rules " a throwback to an age when radio was the only national communication device and spectrum was scarce " .
" those days are now gone and we 're competing and fighting for revenue against national television , the press , the internet and digital in all its forms .
" there 's big scope to relax some of the regulation on localness , formats and ownership , which is holding the sector back . "
but mr myers believes radio will remain enormously popular " because of its pure , intrinsic entertainment value " .

by kevin young entertainment reporter , bbc news new technologies and changing habits mean the way people listen to the radio has been revolutionised in recent years .

she stresses the addition of images must be done " sensitively and intelligently " and without turning radio into " tv lite " .
just a minute did not work well when it moved to tv , mr damazer says however , bbc radio 4 controller mark damazer warns that caution is needed in this area , because audiences will only tolerate " a genuinely rewarding add-on " .
" if you shoved a single camera into the in our time studio , suddenly having that as a ' tv thing ' is not going to work , " he says .
" it will just destroy its magic . "
he remembers a tv run for radio 4 's comedy quiz just a minute which " was n't the same " , and says he " remains nervous of what you do to the alchemy of a programme if you throw too much technology at it " .
changing the rules elsewhere , commercial broadcasters are keen for ofcom to loosen restrictions they face in areas such as networking and formats .

" commercial radio needs a bit more freedom in its formats to be able to change quickly , " believes john myers , chief executive of gmg radio .
commercial stations face tough rules on formats and networking " there 's only one industry in the uk which is regulated as much as commercial radio and that 's the nuclear industry , " he says .
andrew harrison , who flies the flag for commercial stations as chief executive of industry body the radio company , calls these rules " a throwback to an age when radio was the only national communication device and spectrum was scarce " .

by kevin young entertainment reporter , bbc news new technologies and changing habits mean the way people listen to the radio has been revolutionised in recent years .
a week of articles on the 40th birthdays of radios 1 to 4 concludes by asking leading industry figures how they believe radio is shaping up for the next four decades .
there have been dramatic changes in the way people listen to the radio the days of families gathering around a huge radio to enjoy an evening of entertainment passed long ago .
now , you do not even need to own a set to hear programmes - mobile phones and mp3 players come equipped with tuners while stations are available through tvs on set-top boxes .
and on-demand services and podcasts offer a way to listen when it suits , rather than following a schedule .
" the power being in the hands of the audience to dictate when they 're going to listen to something will get bigger and bigger , " says radio 2 controller lesley douglas .
" but i think the tipping point is further away than people think .
for the foreseeable future , i think listening will be driven by tuning in to , say , terry wogan because he 's on at breakfast . "
' scattered ' listening ralph bernard , chief executive of gcap media , thinks it will become natural to pause and rewind live programmes , " particularly when the phone goes " .
" if my wife is listening to the archers , it is absolutely natural for her to hit the ' pause ' button - a feature you just do n't get with ordinary analogue radio . "
i can have a podcast channel and let 's imagine i decide the next episode will be a pdf file .
that could include audio , video , text - whatever i like dean whitbread uk podcasters association but while mark goodier , the ex-radio 1 dj who is currently at smooth radio in london , is sure radio will become more " timeshifted " , he does not think this is necessarily progress .
" i 'm hoping that in 10 years ' time , people will have rediscovered the joys of making an appointment to listen .
the successful stations will be the ones that achieve that . "
he believes that having " lots of content that people grab " will make it hard for broadcasters to accurately measure ratings , and could even threaten their financial futures .
" how do you justify millions of pounds a year for radio 2 if it 's all over the place , and for commercial radio , how do you sell -lsb- advertising -rsb- if listening is scattered ? "
podcasting the bbc and other broadcasters now issue effectively programme highlights as podcasts - audio files which can be downloaded on to computers or portable music devices .
the bbc radio player lets online users " listen again " to programming but this particular format is at its best pushing the boundaries of " traditional radio " , according to dean whitbread , who chairs the uk podcasters association .
" podcasts can really do or be anything , " he says .
" i can have a podcast channel and let 's imagine i decide the next episode will be a pdf file .

such extras can help to " put visuals into radio " , mr whitbread adds , which is an " interesting and exciting " prospect .

cardiff chamber of commerce says the road systems in the area are too congested and that has a detrimental impact on business .
it fears the welsh economy will fall behind other parts of the uk unless something is done to improve roads .
it estimates £ 500m is needed to improve the infrastructure .
traffic gridlock after two fatal crashes on the m4 in two months has highlighted the issue of the transport infrastructure in and around cardiff and the south east of wales .
cardiff chamber of commerce said charging drivers is the only way a major road expansion programme , which would include a new dual lane ring road around cardiff and increasing the capacity of the m4 could be paid for .

" unless we change things , we will have grid lock in cardiff at peak hours within two or three years . "
the chamber 's report also looks at opening up bus " corridors " on main routes , improving rail services and the links to cardiff international airport and ports .
mr goodway said millions of pounds were needed to pay for the infrastructure to be improved .
" the estimates carried out by cardiff council three years ago put a price tag of around £ 500m on what needs to be done , " he said .
" there 's complete acceptance that the money needed to put those solutions in place will not come from traditional sources that is tax payers funds .
mr davies said congestion was a problem in cardiff and newport " therefore we are going to have to turn to the private sector to generate the money .
" as much as we would like it to replace road fund licenses and fuel duty we need to make sure south wales stays ahead of the game .

the four unions and employers are resuming talks held on tuesday , where there were signs of progress .
gmb union spokesman eamonn coy said : " i can not understand why any union would go on strike in circumstances where negotiations are ongoing . "
nipsa 's john corey described mr coy 's comments as " disgraceful " .
" they do a disservice to the thousands of classroom assistants who took strike action on wednesday and gave full and unequivocal support for that , " he said .
however , mr coy said he believed the dispute could be resolved without members of his union taking strike action .
" i will not have gmb members unnecessarily lose pay , they are already on low pay , " he said .
if the dispute is not settled , nipsa has warned that a further three-day strike could take place next week , followed by an all-out strike the following week .

the purchase is estimated to have cost about £ 6m , at roughly £ 10,000 a share .
the deal means his investment company , red and white holdings , has upped its holding by around 2 % .
earlier this week , arsenal 's annual financial results to 31 may 2007 showed that income had soared 46 % to £ 200.8m , up from £ 137.2m a year before .
the arsenal board said that the strong results showed that there was no need for a wealthy individual backer , and insisted that it was not about to sell up .
stake building mr usmanov is a metals magnate with an estimated $ 5.5bn fortune .
he first bought into arsenal in august when he paid former vice-chairman david dein about £ 75m for his 14.65 % holding .
that holding was increased earlier this month when he bought another two tranches of shares .
last week russian media reports said that mr usmanov now aims to up his share in arsenal to at least 25 % plus one share .
should mr usmanov reach a 30 % stake in the club then he would be obliged to make a takeover offer .
the club 's financial results showed that its operating profits before player trading and exceptional items was £ 51.2m , up from £ 13.7m the previous year .
match income is now £ 3.1m a game , with total match income over the past year of £ 90.6m.
however , tv revenues were down on 2005/06 , when the club reached the champions league final , by £ 10m .

microsoft was scheduled to stop selling the six-year-old operating system on 30 january 2008 to leave the field clear for vista .
now the date on which many sellers of xp will no longer be able to offer it has been lengthened to 30 june 2008 .
microsoft said the change was to help those customers that needed more time to make the switch to vista .
sales profile in a statement mike nash , microsoft 's windows product manager , said : " ... maybe we were a little ambitious to think that we would need to make windows xp available for only a year after the release of windows vista . "
he added that most of the other operating systems that microsoft has produced were available for about two years after a new version shipped .
the newest microsoft operating system , windows vista , had a staged release between november 2006 and late january 2007 .
in some quarters vista had a lukewarm response and in april 2007 pc maker dell was forced by customers to re-start sales of computers with xp installed .
in january of that year the computer firm switched to vista on almost all of the machines aimed at home users .
software giant microsoft does run a scheme that lets people rollback installation of vista business and ultimate edition to windows xp by ringing a customer support centre and getting an activation code .
microsoft denied that the policy change was due to slow demand for vista .
mr nash said that up to the summer of 2007 microsoft had sold more than 60 million licences for vista .
this put it on track to be the fastest selling operating system in microsoft 's history .
the xp date change applies to retailers and other manufacturers who sell microsoft products .
independent firms that use windows xp when installing and maintaining computers and networks for businesses can continue to offer it as an option until 30 january 2009 .
microsoft is also extending the availability of the cut-down version of xp , called starter edition , until 30 june 2010 .
it said this was because it was seeing increased demand for the software to run on low-powered devices made specifically for the developing world .
