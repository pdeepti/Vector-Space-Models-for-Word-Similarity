berlin and hamburg failed to win the group 's support to host summer games . the dosb refused to support any potential bid by hamburg or berlin to host the 2016 or 2020 summer games in the wake of failed bids by berlin for the 2000 and leipzig for the 2012 events .
" we have reached the decision that we view very positively a possible bid for a winter olympics under the umbrella of the city of munich , " dosb president thomas bach said tuesday in frankfurt where the organization 's executive committee is meeting .
the final decision will be made at the dosb congress in december .
the international olympic committee is expected to name the host for the 2018 olympics in 2011 .
munich mayor christian ude welcomed the announcement , saying " a major and important hurdle has been cleared on our way to becoming an olympic city once again . "
the bavarian capital hosted the 1972 summer olympics and would become the first city to host a winter and summer games if it puts together a successful bid .
ude announced that the winter resort of garmisch-partenkirchen , situated in the alps south of munich , would definitely be part of any bid and he also refused to rule out other locations .
munich intended to put together a " compact " bid , he said , citing the canadian city of vancouver , host of the 2010 games , as the role model .
dosb aware of mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb will make sure nothing goes wrong this time " a good bid needs a clear concept and a clear financing structure , " said dosb general director michael vesper , while bach estimated the bid budget at between 25 million and 35 million euros -lrb- $ 34.5 million to $ 48.4 million -rrb- .
" but we should n't restrict ourselves to a bid that simply puts superb sports venues in places , we also need an inspiring idea , " said bach .
they also need things to run smoothly once that idea is in place .
germany 's most recent olympic bids have been mired in controversy - and failure - despite having impressive plans to offer .
the joint leipzig / rostock bid for the 2012 games struggled to even make the voting for the candidate cities in 2004 after being crippled by scandals involving alleged financial irregularities and the bid organizers ' ties to the stasi , the former east german secret police .
stasi rumors and dodgy dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's bid for 2012 went up in flames first were the allegations surrounding dirk thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , concerning his past involvement with the stasi .
thärichen resigned from the post in 2003 .
then harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly-run olympic marketing committee , resigned soon after , dogged by similar stasi speculation and allegations of complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
he was followed through the exit by burkhard jung , the city official who represented leipzig during the city ’ s successful bid to become the german candidate before becoming a supervisory board member of the company overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
he stepped down from his position after allegations he was involved in illegal commission payments worth 150,000 euros made to a marketing company while leipzig was bidding to represent germany .
the heads kept rolling with wolfram köhler , the state secretary for saxony , who resigned after he had come under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa .
berlin hampered by cold war legacy berlin 's efforts to get the 2000 olympic games ended in humiliation , when it came last among the six countries vying for the honor .
the newly unified capital 's bid floundered on its inadequate infrastructure , which had suffered during the divisions of the cold war .
while berlin attempted to catch up with its rival bidders by embarking on ambitious building projects , the city was too far behind the pack to get the olympic nod and the games eventually went to sydney .
now , after hosting a hugely successful world cup in 2006 , germany 's big event credentials have sky-rocketed and the dosb hopes to tap into that and put the disappointment of the past behind it . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a statement by portugal , as current eu president , praised libya for its " constructive attitude " and noted " the potential of increased eu-libya cooperation in many areas of common interest . "
the eu was committed to working on the framework of future eu-libya relations , the statement added .
european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters he wanted a " further normalization " of relations with libya but gave no indication of what this would involve .
officials said further work on building better ties with libya would be done by eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who played a key role in securing the release of the medics , five nurses and a doctor .
" this decision will open the way for a new and enhanced relationship between the eu and libya , " said ferrero-waldner , adding ties would also be reinforced with north african states .
but is libya reliable ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner played a large role in the medics release graham watson , the leader of the european parliament 's liberal group , said libya 's decision to free the medics meant the country would not return to international isolation .
" this news will ... assist in the normalization of relations and open the possibility for closer cooperation through the euro-mediterranean partnership , " watson said .
he warned , however , that libya still had to demonstrate that it could be a reliable partner in the long term .
relations between the eu and libya have improved in recent years , but the country is not a member of the bloc 's 11-year-old euro-mediterranean -lrb- euro-med -rrb- partnership which covers all other north african countries .
eu diplomats have long argued that libya does not meet the human rights and democracy standards required to join the euro-med relationship .
but the country has been given observer status when attending euro-med meetings .
libya is also not included in the eu 's so-called " neighborhood policy " under which states on the bloc 's southern and eastern borders receive financial aid for political and economic reform .
change after un sanctions lifted eu relations with libya began to improve slowly following the lifting of un sanctions against tripoli in september 2003 , and libyan leader moammar gadhafi visited eu institutions in april 2004 .
in october of that year , eu governments repealed so-called " restrictive measures " against libya adopted as part of the un framework and also lifted an arms embargo against the country introduced in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the medics arrived in sofia , bulgaria , tuesday morning recently , the european commission , italy and other eu states have sought libyan help in combating the flow of illegal african immigrants to the eu .
several eu member states have extensive trade relations with libya .
italy , germany , britain and france are libya 's four leading suppliers of manufactured goods , energy and food products and raw materials .
italy , germany , spain , france and greece are libya 's top five export markets , taking in about 78 percent of the country 's exports of energy , food products and raw materials .

the eu " stands ready to play an active role " in an international middle east peace conference in autumn proposed by the united states and backed by middle east mediators last week , eu foreign ministers said in a statement on monday after a meeting in brussels .
eu top diplomat javier solana said that the idea of such a conference had always been in the mind of the eu and that the bloc was " completely in favor of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters that the meeting would be an opportunity to draw conclusions " on how we can move ahead on the way to a two-state solution . "
while eu foreign chiefs welcomed israel 's recent move to release 255 palestinian prisoners and the partial transfer of palestinian tax and custom revenues , they called for " the immediate , complete and regular release of the remaining and future funds . "
the eu-27 also urged israel " to take further steps to meet the commitments " towards the palestinians , including a removal of checkpoints and barriers in the west bank .
full support for abbas ministers confirmed the eu 's " full support " for palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
like the us , the eu has pledged to improve the clout and standing of abbas and his moderate fatah movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas -lrb- left -rrb- and israeli prime minister ehud olmert " reconciliation and national unity behind the program of peace articulated by president abbas are the only way to achieve palestinian national goals by peaceful , lawful and democratic means , " ministers said .
" the eu opposes any division of the palestinian territories and confirms its readiness to engage with all palestinian parties whose policy and actions reflect the -lsb- middle east -rsb- quartet principles , " they said .
members of the quartet last week said they would not talk to hamas , repeating that the militant group - which has seized control of the gaza strip from abbas ' forces - must first recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce terrorism and sign up to past agreements with israel .
funds still unreleased eu ministers said that the bloc was committed " to help build the institutions and economy of the future palestinian state . "
unlike washington , the eu has yet to release millions of dollars in direct aid to the fatah-led palestinian government .
the funds were frozen after last year 's hamas electoral victory .
the militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the us .
the eu has , however , been channeling aid for the palestinian health and security sector through non-governmental aid groups .
ministers also said that the engagement of arab countries was " a major element in moving the middle east peace process forward . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's a bit strange serving her , but she 's very nice .

a statement by portugal , as current eu president , praised libya for its " constructive attitude " and noted " the potential of increased eu-libya cooperation in many areas of common interest . "
the eu was committed to working on the framework of future eu-libya relations , the statement added .
european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters he wanted a " further normalization " of relations with libya but gave no indication of what this would involve .
officials said further work on building better ties with libya would be done by eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who played a key role in securing the release of the medics , five nurses and a doctor .
" this decision will open the way for a new and enhanced relationship between the eu and libya , " said ferrero-waldner , adding ties would also be reinforced with north african states .
but is libya reliable ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner played a large role in the medics release graham watson , the leader of the european parliament 's liberal group , said libya 's decision to free the medics meant the country would not return to international isolation .
" this news will ... assist in the normalization of relations and open the possibility for closer cooperation through the euro-mediterranean partnership , " watson said .
he warned , however , that libya still had to demonstrate that it could be a reliable partner in the long term .
relations between the eu and libya have improved in recent years , but the country is not a member of the bloc 's 11-year-old euro-mediterranean -lrb- euro-med -rrb- partnership which covers all other north african countries .
eu diplomats have long argued that libya does not meet the human rights and democracy standards required to join the euro-med relationship .
but the country has been given observer status when attending euro-med meetings .
libya is also not included in the eu 's so-called " neighborhood policy " under which states on the bloc 's southern and eastern borders receive financial aid for political and economic reform .
change after un sanctions lifted eu relations with libya began to improve slowly following the lifting of un sanctions against tripoli in september 2003 , and libyan leader moammar gadhafi visited eu institutions in april 2004 .
in october of that year , eu governments repealed so-called " restrictive measures " against libya adopted as part of the un framework and also lifted an arms embargo against the country introduced in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the medics arrived in sofia , bulgaria , tuesday morning recently , the european commission , italy and other eu states have sought libyan help in combating the flow of illegal african immigrants to the eu .
several eu member states have extensive trade relations with libya .
italy , germany , britain and france are libya 's four leading suppliers of manufactured goods , energy and food products and raw materials .
italy , germany , spain , france and greece are libya 's top five export markets , taking in about 78 percent of the country 's exports of energy , food products and raw materials .
help for sick children eu medical assistance has been given to victims of hiv / aids at benghazi hospital .

berlin has promised to maintain its efforts in the region . nations actively involved in rebuilding afghanistan need to stick to their promises , koenigs said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel on tuesday in berlin .
" afghanistan is a long-term commitment and the afghans expect us to live up to our obligations , " he said , describing the current situation as " extremely difficult . "
an increase in violence by remnants of the ousted taliban regime has seen a spate of attacks on nato-led peacekeepers as well as suicide bombings and kidnappings of foreigners .
un envoy calls for democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and tom koenigs address the press koenigs said the international community was determined to press ahead with the democratization process in afghanistan by " robust " means if necessary , including the use of military force .
he also said it was vital to check taliban resurgence in the south of the country under the mandate provided to the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
" we will need additional support in the near future because the threat is not yet over , " said koenigs , a german diplomat who is the special representative of un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
merkel : germany stands firm merkel pledged that germany would maintain its commitment to afghanistan , where taliban rebels are holding a german engineer hostage after another german died in their hands this week . " i feel confirmed in many efforts we are making , against the tremendous odds that we are constantly up against , " merkel said .
" this is a long-term , but very important and indisputable engagement . "
a government spokesman said the body of the man was expected to be flown back to germany on wednesday so that an autopsy could be conducted in cologne on thursday .
there were conflicting reports of whether he was shot or died of a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe the taliban is trying to force a german retreat reports reaching kabul on wednesday said the surviving hostage was in poor health and with no access to medical treatment .
the two engineers and five afghans were seized wednesday amid demands by the kidnappers that germany pull out of afghanistan . the german government rejected the demand and the rebels later sought the release of 10 taliban fighters from afghan detention .

berlin and hamburg failed to win the group 's support to host summer games . the dosb refused to support any potential bid by hamburg or berlin to host the 2016 or 2020 summer games in the wake of failed bids by berlin for the 2000 and leipzig for the 2012 events .
" we have reached the decision that we view very positively a possible bid for a winter olympics under the umbrella of the city of munich , " dosb president thomas bach said tuesday in frankfurt where the organization 's executive committee is meeting .
the final decision will be made at the dosb congress in december .
the international olympic committee is expected to name the host for the 2018 olympics in 2011 .
munich mayor christian ude welcomed the announcement , saying " a major and important hurdle has been cleared on our way to becoming an olympic city once again . "
the bavarian capital hosted the 1972 summer olympics and would become the first city to host a winter and summer games if it puts together a successful bid .
ude announced that the winter resort of garmisch-partenkirchen , situated in the alps south of munich , would definitely be part of any bid and he also refused to rule out other locations .
munich intended to put together a " compact " bid , he said , citing the canadian city of vancouver , host of the 2010 games , as the role model .
dosb aware of mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb will make sure nothing goes wrong this time " a good bid needs a clear concept and a clear financing structure , " said dosb general director michael vesper , while bach estimated the bid budget at between 25 million and 35 million euros -lrb- $ 34.5 million to $ 48.4 million -rrb- .
" but we should n't restrict ourselves to a bid that simply puts superb sports venues in places , we also need an inspiring idea , " said bach .
they also need things to run smoothly once that idea is in place .
germany 's most recent olympic bids have been mired in controversy - and failure - despite having impressive plans to offer .
the joint leipzig / rostock bid for the 2012 games struggled to even make the voting for the candidate cities in 2004 after being crippled by scandals involving alleged financial irregularities and the bid organizers ' ties to the stasi , the former east german secret police .
stasi rumors and dodgy dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's bid for 2012 went up in flames first were the allegations surrounding dirk thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , concerning his past involvement with the stasi .
thärichen resigned from the post in 2003 .
then harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly-run olympic marketing committee , resigned soon after , dogged by similar stasi speculation and allegations of complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
he was followed through the exit by burkhard jung , the city official who represented leipzig during the city ’ s successful bid to become the german candidate before becoming a supervisory board member of the company overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
he stepped down from his position after allegations he was involved in illegal commission payments worth 150,000 euros made to a marketing company while leipzig was bidding to represent germany .
the heads kept rolling with wolfram köhler , the state secretary for saxony , who resigned after he had come under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa .
berlin hampered by cold war legacy berlin 's efforts to get the 2000 olympic games ended in humiliation , when it came last among the six countries vying for the honor .
the newly unified capital 's bid floundered on its inadequate infrastructure , which had suffered during the divisions of the cold war .
while berlin attempted to catch up with its rival bidders by embarking on ambitious building projects , the city was too far behind the pack to get the olympic nod and the games eventually went to sydney .

berlin and hamburg failed to win the group 's support to host summer games . the dosb refused to support any potential bid by hamburg or berlin to host the 2016 or 2020 summer games in the wake of failed bids by berlin for the 2000 and leipzig for the 2012 events .
" we have reached the decision that we view very positively a possible bid for a winter olympics under the umbrella of the city of munich , " dosb president thomas bach said tuesday in frankfurt where the organization 's executive committee is meeting .
the final decision will be made at the dosb congress in december .
the international olympic committee is expected to name the host for the 2018 olympics in 2011 .
munich mayor christian ude welcomed the announcement , saying " a major and important hurdle has been cleared on our way to becoming an olympic city once again . "
the bavarian capital hosted the 1972 summer olympics and would become the first city to host a winter and summer games if it puts together a successful bid .
ude announced that the winter resort of garmisch-partenkirchen , situated in the alps south of munich , would definitely be part of any bid and he also refused to rule out other locations .

then harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly-run olympic marketing committee , resigned soon after , dogged by similar stasi speculation and allegations of complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
he was followed through the exit by burkhard jung , the city official who represented leipzig during the city ’ s successful bid to become the german candidate before becoming a supervisory board member of the company overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
he stepped down from his position after allegations he was involved in illegal commission payments worth 150,000 euros made to a marketing company while leipzig was bidding to represent germany .

berlin has promised to maintain its efforts in the region . nations actively involved in rebuilding afghanistan need to stick to their promises , koenigs said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel on tuesday in berlin .
" afghanistan is a long-term commitment and the afghans expect us to live up to our obligations , " he said , describing the current situation as " extremely difficult . "
an increase in violence by remnants of the ousted taliban regime has seen a spate of attacks on nato-led peacekeepers as well as suicide bombings and kidnappings of foreigners .
un envoy calls for democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and tom koenigs address the press koenigs said the international community was determined to press ahead with the democratization process in afghanistan by " robust " means if necessary , including the use of military force .
he also said it was vital to check taliban resurgence in the south of the country under the mandate provided to the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
" we will need additional support in the near future because the threat is not yet over , " said koenigs , a german diplomat who is the special representative of un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
merkel : germany stands firm merkel pledged that germany would maintain its commitment to afghanistan , where taliban rebels are holding a german engineer hostage after another german died in their hands this week . " i feel confirmed in many efforts we are making , against the tremendous odds that we are constantly up against , " merkel said .
" this is a long-term , but very important and indisputable engagement . "
a government spokesman said the body of the man was expected to be flown back to germany on wednesday so that an autopsy could be conducted in cologne on thursday .
there were conflicting reports of whether he was shot or died of a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe the taliban is trying to force a german retreat reports reaching kabul on wednesday said the surviving hostage was in poor health and with no access to medical treatment .
the two engineers and five afghans were seized wednesday amid demands by the kidnappers that germany pull out of afghanistan . the german government rejected the demand and the rebels later sought the release of 10 taliban fighters from afghan detention .
there are 3,000 german troops deployed in northern afghanistan on provincial reconstruction missions .
there are also six german tornado warplanes carrying out surveillance missions for the isaf . the german defense ministry confirmed that the tornado aircraft helped locate the hostage , while afghan security forces were in the mountains but did not intervene . support needed for afghanistan 's neighbors both merkel and koenigs also appealed to the international community to increase assistance to afghanistan 's neighbors , particularly pakistan , where a recent upsurge in violence by islamic radicals and tribal militants is threatening the stability of president pervez musharraf 's government .

" one can hardly say that it 's the result of a change of trend , " political scientist dieter oberndörfer of the university of freiburg told german news agency dpa .
slightly over a million people have assumed german nationality since the country 's new citizenship law came into effect in 2000 .
the numbers dropped steadily in subsequent years , with only 117,241 foreigners naturalized in 2005 .
turks made up the greatest number of new germans in 2006 , as in previous years , with around 33,500 changing their nationality .
around 12,600 former serbian and montenegrin nationals were in second place , 6,940 poles in third , and 4,690 people from russia in fourth .
they were followed by around 4,550 ukrainians , 4,310 israelis , 3,690 iraqis and 3,550 moroccans .
over 50 percent more israelis and 43 percent more people from serbia and montenegro became german in 2006 than in 2005 .
motivated by outside factors experts expect that the number of turkish applicants will fall as turkey intensifies its ties to the european union .
as turkey has associate membership status with the eu , there are few areas in which turkish nationals experience disadvantages in relation to eu nations , oberndörfer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows dual allegiance , but not dual citizenship people do n't appear to have been mainly attracted to assume the country 's citizenship by the desire to become german .
on the contrary , oberndörfer said most applicants were motivated to become german by outside factors such as the political situation in their countries of origin .
he said the increase in the numbers of israelis and people from serbia and montenegro who were naturalized had to do with the " growing insecurity in israel and a situation without perspectives in serbia . "
foreigners can apply to be naturalized as germans after eight years as legal immigrants , but germany does not grant them citizenship unless they legally abandon their old nationality . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a statement by portugal , as current eu president , praised libya for its " constructive attitude " and noted " the potential of increased eu-libya cooperation in many areas of common interest . "
the eu was committed to working on the framework of future eu-libya relations , the statement added .
european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters he wanted a " further normalization " of relations with libya but gave no indication of what this would involve .
officials said further work on building better ties with libya would be done by eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who played a key role in securing the release of the medics , five nurses and a doctor .
" this decision will open the way for a new and enhanced relationship between the eu and libya , " said ferrero-waldner , adding ties would also be reinforced with north african states .
but is libya reliable ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner played a large role in the medics release graham watson , the leader of the european parliament 's liberal group , said libya 's decision to free the medics meant the country would not return to international isolation .
" this news will ... assist in the normalization of relations and open the possibility for closer cooperation through the euro-mediterranean partnership , " watson said .
he warned , however , that libya still had to demonstrate that it could be a reliable partner in the long term .
relations between the eu and libya have improved in recent years , but the country is not a member of the bloc 's 11-year-old euro-mediterranean -lrb- euro-med -rrb- partnership which covers all other north african countries .
eu diplomats have long argued that libya does not meet the human rights and democracy standards required to join the euro-med relationship .
but the country has been given observer status when attending euro-med meetings .
libya is also not included in the eu 's so-called " neighborhood policy " under which states on the bloc 's southern and eastern borders receive financial aid for political and economic reform .
change after un sanctions lifted eu relations with libya began to improve slowly following the lifting of un sanctions against tripoli in september 2003 , and libyan leader moammar gadhafi visited eu institutions in april 2004 .
in october of that year , eu governments repealed so-called " restrictive measures " against libya adopted as part of the un framework and also lifted an arms embargo against the country introduced in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the medics arrived in sofia , bulgaria , tuesday morning recently , the european commission , italy and other eu states have sought libyan help in combating the flow of illegal african immigrants to the eu .
several eu member states have extensive trade relations with libya .
italy , germany , britain and france are libya 's four leading suppliers of manufactured goods , energy and food products and raw materials .
italy , germany , spain , france and greece are libya 's top five export markets , taking in about 78 percent of the country 's exports of energy , food products and raw materials .
help for sick children eu medical assistance has been given to victims of hiv / aids at benghazi hospital .
in 1999 , the medics were declared guilty of deliberately infecting hundreds of children there with the virus .

" one can hardly say that it 's the result of a change of trend , " political scientist dieter oberndörfer of the university of freiburg told german news agency dpa .
slightly over a million people have assumed german nationality since the country 's new citizenship law came into effect in 2000 .

around 12,600 former serbian and montenegrin nationals were in second place , 6,940 poles in third , and 4,690 people from russia in fourth .
they were followed by around 4,550 ukrainians , 4,310 israelis , 3,690 iraqis and 3,550 moroccans .
over 50 percent more israelis and 43 percent more people from serbia and montenegro became german in 2006 than in 2005 .

he said the increase in the numbers of israelis and people from serbia and montenegro who were naturalized had to do with the " growing insecurity in israel and a situation without perspectives in serbia . "

" one can hardly say that it 's the result of a change of trend , " political scientist dieter oberndörfer of the university of freiburg told german news agency dpa .
slightly over a million people have assumed german nationality since the country 's new citizenship law came into effect in 2000 .
the numbers dropped steadily in subsequent years , with only 117,241 foreigners naturalized in 2005 .
turks made up the greatest number of new germans in 2006 , as in previous years , with around 33,500 changing their nationality .
around 12,600 former serbian and montenegrin nationals were in second place , 6,940 poles in third , and 4,690 people from russia in fourth .
they were followed by around 4,550 ukrainians , 4,310 israelis , 3,690 iraqis and 3,550 moroccans .
over 50 percent more israelis and 43 percent more people from serbia and montenegro became german in 2006 than in 2005 .
motivated by outside factors experts expect that the number of turkish applicants will fall as turkey intensifies its ties to the european union .
as turkey has associate membership status with the eu , there are few areas in which turkish nationals experience disadvantages in relation to eu nations , oberndörfer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows dual allegiance , but not dual citizenship people do n't appear to have been mainly attracted to assume the country 's citizenship by the desire to become german .
on the contrary , oberndörfer said most applicants were motivated to become german by outside factors such as the political situation in their countries of origin .
he said the increase in the numbers of israelis and people from serbia and montenegro who were naturalized had to do with the " growing insecurity in israel and a situation without perspectives in serbia . "

as german chancellor angela merkel prepares to meet un representative to afghanistan tom koenigs on tuesday to discuss the situation , the debate over the future of german forces engaged in missions as part of the wider , us-led " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- rages behind the scenes .
merkel 's government has rejected all calls for its armed forces to be pulled out of afghanistan but those who are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition , such as the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens , are unlikely to be brushed off so easily .
the spd , the other party in merkel 's grand coalition government , are vociferously against the bundeswehr being involved in any us-controlled anti-terror operation , and the greens continue to hold their previous stance of rejecting out-right the mandate that sent german troops overseas as part of oef .
meanwhile , the left-wing alliance left party has called for an immediate removal of the armed forces .
public opinion is also being affected by the reports of increasing danger to germans overseas .
a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
at the moment , the government refuses to budge saying that the increased targeting of german personnel in afghanistan , both military and civilian , is a tactic employed by the taliban to provoke a debate over a withdrawal .
merkel and government staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the recent german casualties , merkel said german troops will stay in afghanistan merkel herself has said that the government will not respond to blackmail and that german troops were in afghanistan as a matter of international and domestic security .
" we are there because german security is also being protected over there , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" it is our concept to combine military issues with reconstruction . "
with the bundestag to decide on the extension of the bundeswehr 's mandate in afghanistan in the fall , some security experts , most notably the bundeswehr 's chief of staff wolfgang schneiderhan , have warned that the taliban is likely to increase its pressure in a bid to influence the outcome of the coming parliamentary debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs could not say if germans were specific targets however , speaking ahead of his meeting with merkel , un representative koenigs could not say whether there was a concerted effort to influence the debate by specifically targeting germans in afghanistan or if the current activity towards them will continue .
" the uprising is directed against the government as well as against the international community which it supports , " koenigs told german public broadcaster ndr .
" but i do not see a general hostility towards foreigners yet .
of course , those softer targets and those least defended , such as foreign tourists and workers , are in the most danger and this is certainly a problem . "
koenigs did , however , admit that the taliban was acutely aware of the power of its actions in the wider political domain .
" the taliban are of course very well versed in the media , " he added .
" and every reaction by a perceived enemy state is regarded as a victory and of course used as such .
these taliban forces are very engaged politically . "
koenigs in favor of extended german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs supports the bundeswehr 's mission the un representative also said he was in favor of keeping german troops in afghanistan and dismissed talk of " iraqization " - the concerted targeting of foreign nationals as kidnap victims and high-profile , ideologically motivated kills - in afghanistan .
he called on germany to extend its mandate when the time came , both military as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and as part of the reconstruction efforts .
" we have done the right thing , " koenigs said .
" we should stay the course , even if there is danger , even if we have some difficult times ahead .
despite the dangers and difficulties , we are also welcomed in afghanistan .
" i found the decision of the german society for technical collaboration -lrb- gtz -rrb- to continue with reconstruction efforts in the south to be particularly helpful , " he continued .

dw spoke with the most likely candidate , richard wagner 's great-granddaughter katharina . ever since wolfgang wagner , director of the bayreuth festival and the composer 's grandson , announced in 1999 that the search for a worthy successor was underway , festival fans and classical music connoisseurs have been hotly speculating on the lucky heir .
the 88-year-old impresario 's daughter katharina , 29 , now seems to have emerged as a favorite for the job , stepping ahead of her older sister eva and cousin nike , both twice her age .
katharina wagner will make her bayreuth festival directing debut on july 25 , the opening night , with her staging of richard wagner 's " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .
you grew up and learned there in the house .
what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .
ultimately , new impulses from the outside come in - the nuremberg system ca n't exist any more as it did and nuremberg changes at the end of the second act .
innovation collides with tradition , which for me is the most exiting issues in the opera , that these master singers are really a big art class .
and that 's one of the biggest questions : what 's the relationship between innovation and tradition , and art - or the artist - and society ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wait for years to get tickets in reference to you becoming the next festival director , your father has said , " if she can , then she should . "
how do you see this statement ?
that 's typical of my father .
whoever knows my father will know that that 's original wolfgang wagner .
although he said , " if she can and wants to . "
which conditions have to be met for you to accept the position ?
it does n't only depend on me .
it mostly depends on other people .
at the moment , my father is both manager and director in one and this constellation will change .
there will be four managers .
these four people have high expectations for a festival director , which i do n't know if i can fulfill .
it 's also a matter that needs to be discussed - what do the managers expect , what do i expect from them .
these things just all have to fit .
what 's the most important condition for you ?
that the artistic quality remains .

the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .
ultimately , new impulses from the outside come in - the nuremberg system ca n't exist any more as it did and nuremberg changes at the end of the second act .
innovation collides with tradition , which for me is the most exiting issues in the opera , that these master singers are really a big art class .
and that 's one of the biggest questions : what 's the relationship between innovation and tradition , and art - or the artist - and society ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wait for years to get tickets in reference to you becoming the next festival director , your father has said , " if she can , then she should . "
how do you see this statement ?
that 's typical of my father .
whoever knows my father will know that that 's original wolfgang wagner .
although he said , " if she can and wants to . "
which conditions have to be met for you to accept the position ?
it does n't only depend on me .
it mostly depends on other people .
at the moment , my father is both manager and director in one and this constellation will change .
there will be four managers .
these four people have high expectations for a festival director , which i do n't know if i can fulfill .
it 's also a matter that needs to be discussed - what do the managers expect , what do i expect from them .
these things just all have to fit .
what 's the most important condition for you ?
that the artistic quality remains .

dw spoke with the most likely candidate , richard wagner 's great-granddaughter katharina . ever since wolfgang wagner , director of the bayreuth festival and the composer 's grandson , announced in 1999 that the search for a worthy successor was underway , festival fans and classical music connoisseurs have been hotly speculating on the lucky heir .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .

it does n't only depend on me .
it mostly depends on other people .
at the moment , my father is both manager and director in one and this constellation will change .
there will be four managers .
these four people have high expectations for a festival director , which i do n't know if i can fulfill .
it 's also a matter that needs to be discussed - what do the managers expect , what do i expect from them .
these things just all have to fit .
what 's the most important condition for you ?
that the artistic quality remains .

berlin and hamburg failed to win the group 's support to host summer games . the dosb refused to support any potential bid by hamburg or berlin to host the 2016 or 2020 summer games in the wake of failed bids by berlin for the 2000 and leipzig for the 2012 events .
" we have reached the decision that we view very positively a possible bid for a winter olympics under the umbrella of the city of munich , " dosb president thomas bach said tuesday in frankfurt where the organization 's executive committee is meeting .
the final decision will be made at the dosb congress in december .
the international olympic committee is expected to name the host for the 2018 olympics in 2011 .
munich mayor christian ude welcomed the announcement , saying " a major and important hurdle has been cleared on our way to becoming an olympic city once again . "
the bavarian capital hosted the 1972 summer olympics and would become the first city to host a winter and summer games if it puts together a successful bid .
ude announced that the winter resort of garmisch-partenkirchen , situated in the alps south of munich , would definitely be part of any bid and he also refused to rule out other locations .
munich intended to put together a " compact " bid , he said , citing the canadian city of vancouver , host of the 2010 games , as the role model .
dosb aware of mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb will make sure nothing goes wrong this time " a good bid needs a clear concept and a clear financing structure , " said dosb general director michael vesper , while bach estimated the bid budget at between 25 million and 35 million euros -lrb- $ 34.5 million to $ 48.4 million -rrb- .
" but we should n't restrict ourselves to a bid that simply puts superb sports venues in places , we also need an inspiring idea , " said bach .
they also need things to run smoothly once that idea is in place .
germany 's most recent olympic bids have been mired in controversy - and failure - despite having impressive plans to offer .
the joint leipzig / rostock bid for the 2012 games struggled to even make the voting for the candidate cities in 2004 after being crippled by scandals involving alleged financial irregularities and the bid organizers ' ties to the stasi , the former east german secret police .
stasi rumors and dodgy dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's bid for 2012 went up in flames first were the allegations surrounding dirk thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , concerning his past involvement with the stasi .
thärichen resigned from the post in 2003 .
then harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly-run olympic marketing committee , resigned soon after , dogged by similar stasi speculation and allegations of complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
he was followed through the exit by burkhard jung , the city official who represented leipzig during the city ’ s successful bid to become the german candidate before becoming a supervisory board member of the company overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
he stepped down from his position after allegations he was involved in illegal commission payments worth 150,000 euros made to a marketing company while leipzig was bidding to represent germany .
the heads kept rolling with wolfram köhler , the state secretary for saxony , who resigned after he had come under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa .
berlin hampered by cold war legacy berlin 's efforts to get the 2000 olympic games ended in humiliation , when it came last among the six countries vying for the honor .
the newly unified capital 's bid floundered on its inadequate infrastructure , which had suffered during the divisions of the cold war .
while berlin attempted to catch up with its rival bidders by embarking on ambitious building projects , the city was too far behind the pack to get the olympic nod and the games eventually went to sydney .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.07.2007 eu plans upgraded ties with libya after medics ' release großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking up for realtions between the eu and gadhafi 's libya the european union on tuesday promised to upgrade political and economic ties with libya after authorities in tripoli released six bulgarian medics who had been sentenced to life in prison there . details of just how - and how fast - the so-far stagnant eu-libyan relationship will be improved were still being considered , officials said .
a statement by portugal , as current eu president , praised libya for its " constructive attitude " and noted " the potential of increased eu-libya cooperation in many areas of common interest . "
the eu was committed to working on the framework of future eu-libya relations , the statement added .
european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters he wanted a " further normalization " of relations with libya but gave no indication of what this would involve .
officials said further work on building better ties with libya would be done by eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who played a key role in securing the release of the medics , five nurses and a doctor .
" this decision will open the way for a new and enhanced relationship between the eu and libya , " said ferrero-waldner , adding ties would also be reinforced with north african states .
but is libya reliable ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner played a large role in the medics release graham watson , the leader of the european parliament 's liberal group , said libya 's decision to free the medics meant the country would not return to international isolation .
" this news will ... assist in the normalization of relations and open the possibility for closer cooperation through the euro-mediterranean partnership , " watson said .
he warned , however , that libya still had to demonstrate that it could be a reliable partner in the long term .
relations between the eu and libya have improved in recent years , but the country is not a member of the bloc 's 11-year-old euro-mediterranean -lrb- euro-med -rrb- partnership which covers all other north african countries .
eu diplomats have long argued that libya does not meet the human rights and democracy standards required to join the euro-med relationship .
but the country has been given observer status when attending euro-med meetings .
libya is also not included in the eu 's so-called " neighborhood policy " under which states on the bloc 's southern and eastern borders receive financial aid for political and economic reform .
change after un sanctions lifted eu relations with libya began to improve slowly following the lifting of un sanctions against tripoli in september 2003 , and libyan leader moammar gadhafi visited eu institutions in april 2004 .
in october of that year , eu governments repealed so-called " restrictive measures " against libya adopted as part of the un framework and also lifted an arms embargo against the country introduced in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the medics arrived in sofia , bulgaria , tuesday morning recently , the european commission , italy and other eu states have sought libyan help in combating the flow of illegal african immigrants to the eu .
several eu member states have extensive trade relations with libya .
italy , germany , britain and france are libya 's four leading suppliers of manufactured goods , energy and food products and raw materials .
italy , germany , spain , france and greece are libya 's top five export markets , taking in about 78 percent of the country 's exports of energy , food products and raw materials .
help for sick children eu medical assistance has been given to victims of hiv / aids at benghazi hospital .
in 1999 , the medics were declared guilty of deliberately infecting hundreds of children there with the virus .
they received a pardon from bulgarian president georgi parvanov on tuesday - a sign of bulgaria 's acceptance of the group 's complete innocence in the infections of the children .
experts say the aids outbreak at benghazi children 's hospital was caused by bad hygiene . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de bulgarian medics return home from libya , receive pardon the bulgarian medics given life sentences in libya have arrived back home , according to news reports .
they were pardoned by bulgaria 's president and wo n't have to return to prison .

a statement by portugal , as current eu president , praised libya for its " constructive attitude " and noted " the potential of increased eu-libya cooperation in many areas of common interest . "
the eu was committed to working on the framework of future eu-libya relations , the statement added .
european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters he wanted a " further normalization " of relations with libya but gave no indication of what this would involve .
officials said further work on building better ties with libya would be done by eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who played a key role in securing the release of the medics , five nurses and a doctor .
" this decision will open the way for a new and enhanced relationship between the eu and libya , " said ferrero-waldner , adding ties would also be reinforced with north african states .

libya is also not included in the eu 's so-called " neighborhood policy " under which states on the bloc 's southern and eastern borders receive financial aid for political and economic reform .
change after un sanctions lifted eu relations with libya began to improve slowly following the lifting of un sanctions against tripoli in september 2003 , and libyan leader moammar gadhafi visited eu institutions in april 2004 .
in october of that year , eu governments repealed so-called " restrictive measures " against libya adopted as part of the un framework and also lifted an arms embargo against the country introduced in 1986 .

he said the increase in the numbers of israelis and people from serbia and montenegro who were naturalized had to do with the " growing insecurity in israel and a situation without perspectives in serbia . "

around 12,600 former serbian and montenegrin nationals were in second place , 6,940 poles in third , and 4,690 people from russia in fourth .
they were followed by around 4,550 ukrainians , 4,310 israelis , 3,690 iraqis and 3,550 moroccans .
over 50 percent more israelis and 43 percent more people from serbia and montenegro became german in 2006 than in 2005 .
motivated by outside factors experts expect that the number of turkish applicants will fall as turkey intensifies its ties to the european union .
as turkey has associate membership status with the eu , there are few areas in which turkish nationals experience disadvantages in relation to eu nations , oberndörfer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows dual allegiance , but not dual citizenship people do n't appear to have been mainly attracted to assume the country 's citizenship by the desire to become german .
on the contrary , oberndörfer said most applicants were motivated to become german by outside factors such as the political situation in their countries of origin .
he said the increase in the numbers of israelis and people from serbia and montenegro who were naturalized had to do with the " growing insecurity in israel and a situation without perspectives in serbia . "
foreigners can apply to be naturalized as germans after eight years as legal immigrants , but germany does not grant them citizenship unless they legally abandon their old nationality . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 24.07.2007 eu vows to be active in planned international mideast talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks on establishing a palestinian state are to begin in the fall the european union has pledged to take on a major role in planned talks on the establishment of an independent palestinian state and urged israel for further steps on commitments made to the palestinian government . the european union has pledged to take on a major role in planned talks on the establishment of an independent palestinian state and urged israel for further steps on commitments made to the palestinian government .
the eu " stands ready to play an active role " in an international middle east peace conference in autumn proposed by the united states and backed by middle east mediators last week , eu foreign ministers said in a statement on monday after a meeting in brussels .
eu top diplomat javier solana said that the idea of such a conference had always been in the mind of the eu and that the bloc was " completely in favor of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters that the meeting would be an opportunity to draw conclusions " on how we can move ahead on the way to a two-state solution . "
while eu foreign chiefs welcomed israel 's recent move to release 255 palestinian prisoners and the partial transfer of palestinian tax and custom revenues , they called for " the immediate , complete and regular release of the remaining and future funds . "
the eu-27 also urged israel " to take further steps to meet the commitments " towards the palestinians , including a removal of checkpoints and barriers in the west bank .
full support for abbas ministers confirmed the eu 's " full support " for palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
like the us , the eu has pledged to improve the clout and standing of abbas and his moderate fatah movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas -lrb- left -rrb- and israeli prime minister ehud olmert " reconciliation and national unity behind the program of peace articulated by president abbas are the only way to achieve palestinian national goals by peaceful , lawful and democratic means , " ministers said .
" the eu opposes any division of the palestinian territories and confirms its readiness to engage with all palestinian parties whose policy and actions reflect the -lsb- middle east -rsb- quartet principles , " they said .
members of the quartet last week said they would not talk to hamas , repeating that the militant group - which has seized control of the gaza strip from abbas ' forces - must first recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce terrorism and sign up to past agreements with israel .
funds still unreleased eu ministers said that the bloc was committed " to help build the institutions and economy of the future palestinian state . "
unlike washington , the eu has yet to release millions of dollars in direct aid to the fatah-led palestinian government .
the funds were frozen after last year 's hamas electoral victory .
the militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the us .
the eu has , however , been channeling aid for the palestinian health and security sector through non-governmental aid groups .
ministers also said that the engagement of arab countries was " a major element in moving the middle east peace process forward . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu " stands ready to play an active role " in an international middle east peace conference in autumn proposed by the united states and backed by middle east mediators last week , eu foreign ministers said in a statement on monday after a meeting in brussels .
eu top diplomat javier solana said that the idea of such a conference had always been in the mind of the eu and that the bloc was " completely in favor of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters that the meeting would be an opportunity to draw conclusions " on how we can move ahead on the way to a two-state solution . "
while eu foreign chiefs welcomed israel 's recent move to release 255 palestinian prisoners and the partial transfer of palestinian tax and custom revenues , they called for " the immediate , complete and regular release of the remaining and future funds . "
the eu-27 also urged israel " to take further steps to meet the commitments " towards the palestinians , including a removal of checkpoints and barriers in the west bank .
full support for abbas ministers confirmed the eu 's " full support " for palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
like the us , the eu has pledged to improve the clout and standing of abbas and his moderate fatah movement .

" the eu opposes any division of the palestinian territories and confirms its readiness to engage with all palestinian parties whose policy and actions reflect the -lsb- middle east -rsb- quartet principles , " they said .
members of the quartet last week said they would not talk to hamas , repeating that the militant group - which has seized control of the gaza strip from abbas ' forces - must first recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce terrorism and sign up to past agreements with israel .
funds still unreleased eu ministers said that the bloc was committed " to help build the institutions and economy of the future palestinian state . "
unlike washington , the eu has yet to release millions of dollars in direct aid to the fatah-led palestinian government .
the funds were frozen after last year 's hamas electoral victory .
the militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the us .
the eu has , however , been channeling aid for the palestinian health and security sector through non-governmental aid groups .

as german chancellor angela merkel prepares to meet un representative to afghanistan tom koenigs on tuesday to discuss the situation , the debate over the future of german forces engaged in missions as part of the wider , us-led " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- rages behind the scenes .
merkel 's government has rejected all calls for its armed forces to be pulled out of afghanistan but those who are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition , such as the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens , are unlikely to be brushed off so easily .
the spd , the other party in merkel 's grand coalition government , are vociferously against the bundeswehr being involved in any us-controlled anti-terror operation , and the greens continue to hold their previous stance of rejecting out-right the mandate that sent german troops overseas as part of oef .
meanwhile , the left-wing alliance left party has called for an immediate removal of the armed forces .
public opinion is also being affected by the reports of increasing danger to germans overseas .
a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
at the moment , the government refuses to budge saying that the increased targeting of german personnel in afghanistan , both military and civilian , is a tactic employed by the taliban to provoke a debate over a withdrawal .
merkel and government staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the recent german casualties , merkel said german troops will stay in afghanistan merkel herself has said that the government will not respond to blackmail and that german troops were in afghanistan as a matter of international and domestic security .
" we are there because german security is also being protected over there , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" it is our concept to combine military issues with reconstruction . "
with the bundestag to decide on the extension of the bundeswehr 's mandate in afghanistan in the fall , some security experts , most notably the bundeswehr 's chief of staff wolfgang schneiderhan , have warned that the taliban is likely to increase its pressure in a bid to influence the outcome of the coming parliamentary debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs could not say if germans were specific targets however , speaking ahead of his meeting with merkel , un representative koenigs could not say whether there was a concerted effort to influence the debate by specifically targeting germans in afghanistan or if the current activity towards them will continue .
" the uprising is directed against the government as well as against the international community which it supports , " koenigs told german public broadcaster ndr .
" but i do not see a general hostility towards foreigners yet .
of course , those softer targets and those least defended , such as foreign tourists and workers , are in the most danger and this is certainly a problem . "
koenigs did , however , admit that the taliban was acutely aware of the power of its actions in the wider political domain .
" the taliban are of course very well versed in the media , " he added .
" and every reaction by a perceived enemy state is regarded as a victory and of course used as such .
these taliban forces are very engaged politically . "
koenigs in favor of extended german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs supports the bundeswehr 's mission the un representative also said he was in favor of keeping german troops in afghanistan and dismissed talk of " iraqization " - the concerted targeting of foreign nationals as kidnap victims and high-profile , ideologically motivated kills - in afghanistan .
he called on germany to extend its mandate when the time came , both military as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and as part of the reconstruction efforts .
" we have done the right thing , " koenigs said .
" we should stay the course , even if there is danger , even if we have some difficult times ahead .
despite the dangers and difficulties , we are also welcomed in afghanistan .
" i found the decision of the german society for technical collaboration -lrb- gtz -rrb- to continue with reconstruction efforts in the south to be particularly helpful , " he continued .

the state will retain majority control , but fears are rife that local service , in particular , will suffer . the cabinet decision envisions the government selling off a quarter of deutsche bahn shares by the beginning of 2009 .
another 24 percent could also be sold - according to the german constitution , the state is obliged to retain a majority holding as part of its duty to provide germany with rail services . " with this decision , we 've taken a huge step toward implementing the government 's rail reform program , " said german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in berlin on tuesday . the government estimates that selling a 25 percent stake in the german rail company would bring in some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- .
deutsch bahn is europe 's largest rail company and services almost 1.9 billion passengers a year .
it also handles 300 million tons of freight annually .
last year it made some 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- in profits . the cabinet also decided the deutsche bahn would retain control of the track network for the next 15 years . if the flotation goes through , it would be the biggest since the sale of deutsche post stock in 2000 .
but the government 's plan will have to be approved by both houses of the german parliament . hard fight ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn employees held strikes recently for more money but it is by no means certain that the proposed ipo will go ahead amidst protests from local governments , unions and consumer groups .
many fear severe disruptions to services such as occurred in previous privatizations - most notably that of british rail in the 1980 and 90s . contentious issues include the potential canceling of local routes and job losses . " we 're afraid the deutsche bahn will cherry-pick the profitable , long-distance routes between the big cities , " said the head of the german association of cities and towns , gerd landsberg .
" that would also endanger the necessary expansion of jobs in rural areas .
that 's unacceptable . " " the privatization of deutsche bahn threatens to derail the central goal of the rail reform , namely to get more people to use train services , " added german union association board member claus matecki . consumer advocacy groups also fear that privatization could mean price hikes and have called on parliamentarians to reject the proposed flotation . but one union representing rail workers , who have staged strikes recently for better pay , said it welcomed the partial privatization . article based on news reports -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as german chancellor angela merkel prepares to meet un representative to afghanistan tom koenigs on tuesday to discuss the situation , the debate over the future of german forces engaged in missions as part of the wider , us-led " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- rages behind the scenes .
merkel 's government has rejected all calls for its armed forces to be pulled out of afghanistan but those who are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition , such as the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens , are unlikely to be brushed off so easily .
the spd , the other party in merkel 's grand coalition government , are vociferously against the bundeswehr being involved in any us-controlled anti-terror operation , and the greens continue to hold their previous stance of rejecting out-right the mandate that sent german troops overseas as part of oef .
meanwhile , the left-wing alliance left party has called for an immediate removal of the armed forces .
public opinion is also being affected by the reports of increasing danger to germans overseas .
a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
at the moment , the government refuses to budge saying that the increased targeting of german personnel in afghanistan , both military and civilian , is a tactic employed by the taliban to provoke a debate over a withdrawal .
merkel and government staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the recent german casualties , merkel said german troops will stay in afghanistan merkel herself has said that the government will not respond to blackmail and that german troops were in afghanistan as a matter of international and domestic security .
" we are there because german security is also being protected over there , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" it is our concept to combine military issues with reconstruction . "
with the bundestag to decide on the extension of the bundeswehr 's mandate in afghanistan in the fall , some security experts , most notably the bundeswehr 's chief of staff wolfgang schneiderhan , have warned that the taliban is likely to increase its pressure in a bid to influence the outcome of the coming parliamentary debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs could not say if germans were specific targets however , speaking ahead of his meeting with merkel , un representative koenigs could not say whether there was a concerted effort to influence the debate by specifically targeting germans in afghanistan or if the current activity towards them will continue .
" the uprising is directed against the government as well as against the international community which it supports , " koenigs told german public broadcaster ndr .
" but i do not see a general hostility towards foreigners yet .
of course , those softer targets and those least defended , such as foreign tourists and workers , are in the most danger and this is certainly a problem . "
koenigs did , however , admit that the taliban was acutely aware of the power of its actions in the wider political domain .
" the taliban are of course very well versed in the media , " he added .
" and every reaction by a perceived enemy state is regarded as a victory and of course used as such .
these taliban forces are very engaged politically . "

as german chancellor angela merkel prepares to meet un representative to afghanistan tom koenigs on tuesday to discuss the situation , the debate over the future of german forces engaged in missions as part of the wider , us-led " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- rages behind the scenes .
merkel 's government has rejected all calls for its armed forces to be pulled out of afghanistan but those who are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition , such as the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens , are unlikely to be brushed off so easily .
the spd , the other party in merkel 's grand coalition government , are vociferously against the bundeswehr being involved in any us-controlled anti-terror operation , and the greens continue to hold their previous stance of rejecting out-right the mandate that sent german troops overseas as part of oef .
meanwhile , the left-wing alliance left party has called for an immediate removal of the armed forces .
public opinion is also being affected by the reports of increasing danger to germans overseas .
a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
at the moment , the government refuses to budge saying that the increased targeting of german personnel in afghanistan , both military and civilian , is a tactic employed by the taliban to provoke a debate over a withdrawal .
merkel and government staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the recent german casualties , merkel said german troops will stay in afghanistan merkel herself has said that the government will not respond to blackmail and that german troops were in afghanistan as a matter of international and domestic security .

the state will retain majority control , but fears are rife that local service , in particular , will suffer . the cabinet decision envisions the government selling off a quarter of deutsche bahn shares by the beginning of 2009 .
another 24 percent could also be sold - according to the german constitution , the state is obliged to retain a majority holding as part of its duty to provide germany with rail services . " with this decision , we 've taken a huge step toward implementing the government 's rail reform program , " said german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in berlin on tuesday . the government estimates that selling a 25 percent stake in the german rail company would bring in some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- .
deutsch bahn is europe 's largest rail company and services almost 1.9 billion passengers a year .
it also handles 300 million tons of freight annually .
last year it made some 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- in profits . the cabinet also decided the deutsche bahn would retain control of the track network for the next 15 years . if the flotation goes through , it would be the biggest since the sale of deutsche post stock in 2000 .
but the government 's plan will have to be approved by both houses of the german parliament . hard fight ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn employees held strikes recently for more money but it is by no means certain that the proposed ipo will go ahead amidst protests from local governments , unions and consumer groups .
many fear severe disruptions to services such as occurred in previous privatizations - most notably that of british rail in the 1980 and 90s . contentious issues include the potential canceling of local routes and job losses . " we 're afraid the deutsche bahn will cherry-pick the profitable , long-distance routes between the big cities , " said the head of the german association of cities and towns , gerd landsberg .
" that would also endanger the necessary expansion of jobs in rural areas .
that 's unacceptable . " " the privatization of deutsche bahn threatens to derail the central goal of the rail reform , namely to get more people to use train services , " added german union association board member claus matecki . consumer advocacy groups also fear that privatization could mean price hikes and have called on parliamentarians to reject the proposed flotation . but one union representing rail workers , who have staged strikes recently for better pay , said it welcomed the partial privatization . article based on news reports -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a statement by portugal , as current eu president , praised libya for its " constructive attitude " and noted " the potential of increased eu-libya cooperation in many areas of common interest . "
the eu was committed to working on the framework of future eu-libya relations , the statement added .
european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters he wanted a " further normalization " of relations with libya but gave no indication of what this would involve .
officials said further work on building better ties with libya would be done by eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who played a key role in securing the release of the medics , five nurses and a doctor .
" this decision will open the way for a new and enhanced relationship between the eu and libya , " said ferrero-waldner , adding ties would also be reinforced with north african states .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner played a large role in the medics release graham watson , the leader of the european parliament 's liberal group , said libya 's decision to free the medics meant the country would not return to international isolation .
" this news will ... assist in the normalization of relations and open the possibility for closer cooperation through the euro-mediterranean partnership , " watson said .
he warned , however , that libya still had to demonstrate that it could be a reliable partner in the long term .
relations between the eu and libya have improved in recent years , but the country is not a member of the bloc 's 11-year-old euro-mediterranean -lrb- euro-med -rrb- partnership which covers all other north african countries .
eu diplomats have long argued that libya does not meet the human rights and democracy standards required to join the euro-med relationship .
but the country has been given observer status when attending euro-med meetings .
libya is also not included in the eu 's so-called " neighborhood policy " under which states on the bloc 's southern and eastern borders receive financial aid for political and economic reform .
change after un sanctions lifted eu relations with libya began to improve slowly following the lifting of un sanctions against tripoli in september 2003 , and libyan leader moammar gadhafi visited eu institutions in april 2004 .
in october of that year , eu governments repealed so-called " restrictive measures " against libya adopted as part of the un framework and also lifted an arms embargo against the country introduced in 1986 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 24.07.2007 german citizenship numbers spike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has gained over a million new citizens since 2000 germany 's federal statistics office said monday that 124,832 people had become german citizens in 2006 , an increase of around 7,600 , or 6.5 percent , over the previous year . " one can hardly say that it 's the result of a change of trend , " political scientist dieter oberndörfer of the university of freiburg told german news agency dpa .
slightly over a million people have assumed german nationality since the country 's new citizenship law came into effect in 2000 .
the numbers dropped steadily in subsequent years , with only 117,241 foreigners naturalized in 2005 .
turks made up the greatest number of new germans in 2006 , as in previous years , with around 33,500 changing their nationality .
around 12,600 former serbian and montenegrin nationals were in second place , 6,940 poles in third , and 4,690 people from russia in fourth .
they were followed by around 4,550 ukrainians , 4,310 israelis , 3,690 iraqis and 3,550 moroccans .
over 50 percent more israelis and 43 percent more people from serbia and montenegro became german in 2006 than in 2005 .
motivated by outside factors experts expect that the number of turkish applicants will fall as turkey intensifies its ties to the european union .
as turkey has associate membership status with the eu , there are few areas in which turkish nationals experience disadvantages in relation to eu nations , oberndörfer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows dual allegiance , but not dual citizenship people do n't appear to have been mainly attracted to assume the country 's citizenship by the desire to become german .
on the contrary , oberndörfer said most applicants were motivated to become german by outside factors such as the political situation in their countries of origin .
he said the increase in the numbers of israelis and people from serbia and montenegro who were naturalized had to do with the " growing insecurity in israel and a situation without perspectives in serbia . "
foreigners can apply to be naturalized as germans after eight years as legal immigrants , but germany does not grant them citizenship unless they legally abandon their old nationality . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the state will retain majority control , but fears are rife that local service , in particular , will suffer . the cabinet decision envisions the government selling off a quarter of deutsche bahn shares by the beginning of 2009 .
another 24 percent could also be sold - according to the german constitution , the state is obliged to retain a majority holding as part of its duty to provide germany with rail services . " with this decision , we 've taken a huge step toward implementing the government 's rail reform program , " said german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in berlin on tuesday . the government estimates that selling a 25 percent stake in the german rail company would bring in some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- .
deutsch bahn is europe 's largest rail company and services almost 1.9 billion passengers a year .
it also handles 300 million tons of freight annually .
last year it made some 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- in profits . the cabinet also decided the deutsche bahn would retain control of the track network for the next 15 years . if the flotation goes through , it would be the biggest since the sale of deutsche post stock in 2000 .
but the government 's plan will have to be approved by both houses of the german parliament . hard fight ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn employees held strikes recently for more money but it is by no means certain that the proposed ipo will go ahead amidst protests from local governments , unions and consumer groups .
many fear severe disruptions to services such as occurred in previous privatizations - most notably that of british rail in the 1980 and 90s . contentious issues include the potential canceling of local routes and job losses . " we 're afraid the deutsche bahn will cherry-pick the profitable , long-distance routes between the big cities , " said the head of the german association of cities and towns , gerd landsberg .
" that would also endanger the necessary expansion of jobs in rural areas .
that 's unacceptable . " " the privatization of deutsche bahn threatens to derail the central goal of the rail reform , namely to get more people to use train services , " added german union association board member claus matecki . consumer advocacy groups also fear that privatization could mean price hikes and have called on parliamentarians to reject the proposed flotation . but one union representing rail workers , who have staged strikes recently for better pay , said it welcomed the partial privatization . article based on news reports -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu " stands ready to play an active role " in an international middle east peace conference in autumn proposed by the united states and backed by middle east mediators last week , eu foreign ministers said in a statement on monday after a meeting in brussels .
eu top diplomat javier solana said that the idea of such a conference had always been in the mind of the eu and that the bloc was " completely in favor of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters that the meeting would be an opportunity to draw conclusions " on how we can move ahead on the way to a two-state solution . "
while eu foreign chiefs welcomed israel 's recent move to release 255 palestinian prisoners and the partial transfer of palestinian tax and custom revenues , they called for " the immediate , complete and regular release of the remaining and future funds . "
the eu-27 also urged israel " to take further steps to meet the commitments " towards the palestinians , including a removal of checkpoints and barriers in the west bank .
full support for abbas ministers confirmed the eu 's " full support " for palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
like the us , the eu has pledged to improve the clout and standing of abbas and his moderate fatah movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas -lrb- left -rrb- and israeli prime minister ehud olmert " reconciliation and national unity behind the program of peace articulated by president abbas are the only way to achieve palestinian national goals by peaceful , lawful and democratic means , " ministers said .
" the eu opposes any division of the palestinian territories and confirms its readiness to engage with all palestinian parties whose policy and actions reflect the -lsb- middle east -rsb- quartet principles , " they said .
members of the quartet last week said they would not talk to hamas , repeating that the militant group - which has seized control of the gaza strip from abbas ' forces - must first recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce terrorism and sign up to past agreements with israel .
funds still unreleased eu ministers said that the bloc was committed " to help build the institutions and economy of the future palestinian state . "
unlike washington , the eu has yet to release millions of dollars in direct aid to the fatah-led palestinian government .
the funds were frozen after last year 's hamas electoral victory .
the militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the us .
the eu has , however , been channeling aid for the palestinian health and security sector through non-governmental aid groups .
ministers also said that the engagement of arab countries was " a major element in moving the middle east peace process forward . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

another 24 percent could also be sold - according to the german constitution , the state is obliged to retain a majority holding as part of its duty to provide germany with rail services . " with this decision , we 've taken a huge step toward implementing the government 's rail reform program , " said german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in berlin on tuesday . the government estimates that selling a 25 percent stake in the german rail company would bring in some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- .

the eu " stands ready to play an active role " in an international middle east peace conference in autumn proposed by the united states and backed by middle east mediators last week , eu foreign ministers said in a statement on monday after a meeting in brussels .
eu top diplomat javier solana said that the idea of such a conference had always been in the mind of the eu and that the bloc was " completely in favor of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters that the meeting would be an opportunity to draw conclusions " on how we can move ahead on the way to a two-state solution . "
while eu foreign chiefs welcomed israel 's recent move to release 255 palestinian prisoners and the partial transfer of palestinian tax and custom revenues , they called for " the immediate , complete and regular release of the remaining and future funds . "
the eu-27 also urged israel " to take further steps to meet the commitments " towards the palestinians , including a removal of checkpoints and barriers in the west bank .
full support for abbas ministers confirmed the eu 's " full support " for palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
like the us , the eu has pledged to improve the clout and standing of abbas and his moderate fatah movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas -lrb- left -rrb- and israeli prime minister ehud olmert " reconciliation and national unity behind the program of peace articulated by president abbas are the only way to achieve palestinian national goals by peaceful , lawful and democratic means , " ministers said .
" the eu opposes any division of the palestinian territories and confirms its readiness to engage with all palestinian parties whose policy and actions reflect the -lsb- middle east -rsb- quartet principles , " they said .
members of the quartet last week said they would not talk to hamas , repeating that the militant group - which has seized control of the gaza strip from abbas ' forces - must first recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce terrorism and sign up to past agreements with israel .
funds still unreleased eu ministers said that the bloc was committed " to help build the institutions and economy of the future palestinian state . "
unlike washington , the eu has yet to release millions of dollars in direct aid to the fatah-led palestinian government .
the funds were frozen after last year 's hamas electoral victory .
the militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the us .
the eu has , however , been channeling aid for the palestinian health and security sector through non-governmental aid groups .
ministers also said that the engagement of arab countries was " a major element in moving the middle east peace process forward . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin and hamburg failed to win the group 's support to host summer games . the dosb refused to support any potential bid by hamburg or berlin to host the 2016 or 2020 summer games in the wake of failed bids by berlin for the 2000 and leipzig for the 2012 events .
" we have reached the decision that we view very positively a possible bid for a winter olympics under the umbrella of the city of munich , " dosb president thomas bach said tuesday in frankfurt where the organization 's executive committee is meeting .
the final decision will be made at the dosb congress in december .
the international olympic committee is expected to name the host for the 2018 olympics in 2011 .
munich mayor christian ude welcomed the announcement , saying " a major and important hurdle has been cleared on our way to becoming an olympic city once again . "
the bavarian capital hosted the 1972 summer olympics and would become the first city to host a winter and summer games if it puts together a successful bid .
ude announced that the winter resort of garmisch-partenkirchen , situated in the alps south of munich , would definitely be part of any bid and he also refused to rule out other locations .
munich intended to put together a " compact " bid , he said , citing the canadian city of vancouver , host of the 2010 games , as the role model .
dosb aware of mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb will make sure nothing goes wrong this time " a good bid needs a clear concept and a clear financing structure , " said dosb general director michael vesper , while bach estimated the bid budget at between 25 million and 35 million euros -lrb- $ 34.5 million to $ 48.4 million -rrb- .
" but we should n't restrict ourselves to a bid that simply puts superb sports venues in places , we also need an inspiring idea , " said bach .
they also need things to run smoothly once that idea is in place .
germany 's most recent olympic bids have been mired in controversy - and failure - despite having impressive plans to offer .
the joint leipzig / rostock bid for the 2012 games struggled to even make the voting for the candidate cities in 2004 after being crippled by scandals involving alleged financial irregularities and the bid organizers ' ties to the stasi , the former east german secret police .
stasi rumors and dodgy dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's bid for 2012 went up in flames first were the allegations surrounding dirk thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , concerning his past involvement with the stasi .
thärichen resigned from the post in 2003 .
then harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly-run olympic marketing committee , resigned soon after , dogged by similar stasi speculation and allegations of complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
he was followed through the exit by burkhard jung , the city official who represented leipzig during the city ’ s successful bid to become the german candidate before becoming a supervisory board member of the company overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
he stepped down from his position after allegations he was involved in illegal commission payments worth 150,000 euros made to a marketing company while leipzig was bidding to represent germany .
the heads kept rolling with wolfram köhler , the state secretary for saxony , who resigned after he had come under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa .
berlin hampered by cold war legacy berlin 's efforts to get the 2000 olympic games ended in humiliation , when it came last among the six countries vying for the honor .
the newly unified capital 's bid floundered on its inadequate infrastructure , which had suffered during the divisions of the cold war .
while berlin attempted to catch up with its rival bidders by embarking on ambitious building projects , the city was too far behind the pack to get the olympic nod and the games eventually went to sydney .

as german chancellor angela merkel prepares to meet un representative to afghanistan tom koenigs on tuesday to discuss the situation , the debate over the future of german forces engaged in missions as part of the wider , us-led " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- rages behind the scenes .
merkel 's government has rejected all calls for its armed forces to be pulled out of afghanistan but those who are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition , such as the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens , are unlikely to be brushed off so easily .
the spd , the other party in merkel 's grand coalition government , are vociferously against the bundeswehr being involved in any us-controlled anti-terror operation , and the greens continue to hold their previous stance of rejecting out-right the mandate that sent german troops overseas as part of oef .
meanwhile , the left-wing alliance left party has called for an immediate removal of the armed forces .
public opinion is also being affected by the reports of increasing danger to germans overseas .
a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
at the moment , the government refuses to budge saying that the increased targeting of german personnel in afghanistan , both military and civilian , is a tactic employed by the taliban to provoke a debate over a withdrawal .
merkel and government staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the recent german casualties , merkel said german troops will stay in afghanistan merkel herself has said that the government will not respond to blackmail and that german troops were in afghanistan as a matter of international and domestic security .
" we are there because german security is also being protected over there , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" it is our concept to combine military issues with reconstruction . "
with the bundestag to decide on the extension of the bundeswehr 's mandate in afghanistan in the fall , some security experts , most notably the bundeswehr 's chief of staff wolfgang schneiderhan , have warned that the taliban is likely to increase its pressure in a bid to influence the outcome of the coming parliamentary debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs could not say if germans were specific targets however , speaking ahead of his meeting with merkel , un representative koenigs could not say whether there was a concerted effort to influence the debate by specifically targeting germans in afghanistan or if the current activity towards them will continue .
" the uprising is directed against the government as well as against the international community which it supports , " koenigs told german public broadcaster ndr .
" but i do not see a general hostility towards foreigners yet .
of course , those softer targets and those least defended , such as foreign tourists and workers , are in the most danger and this is certainly a problem . "
koenigs did , however , admit that the taliban was acutely aware of the power of its actions in the wider political domain .
" the taliban are of course very well versed in the media , " he added .
" and every reaction by a perceived enemy state is regarded as a victory and of course used as such .
these taliban forces are very engaged politically . "
koenigs in favor of extended german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs supports the bundeswehr 's mission the un representative also said he was in favor of keeping german troops in afghanistan and dismissed talk of " iraqization " - the concerted targeting of foreign nationals as kidnap victims and high-profile , ideologically motivated kills - in afghanistan .
he called on germany to extend its mandate when the time came , both military as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and as part of the reconstruction efforts .
" we have done the right thing , " koenigs said .
" we should stay the course , even if there is danger , even if we have some difficult times ahead .
despite the dangers and difficulties , we are also welcomed in afghanistan .
" i found the decision of the german society for technical collaboration -lrb- gtz -rrb- to continue with reconstruction efforts in the south to be particularly helpful , " he continued .

dw spoke with the most likely candidate , richard wagner 's great-granddaughter katharina . ever since wolfgang wagner , director of the bayreuth festival and the composer 's grandson , announced in 1999 that the search for a worthy successor was underway , festival fans and classical music connoisseurs have been hotly speculating on the lucky heir .
the 88-year-old impresario 's daughter katharina , 29 , now seems to have emerged as a favorite for the job , stepping ahead of her older sister eva and cousin nike , both twice her age .
katharina wagner will make her bayreuth festival directing debut on july 25 , the opening night , with her staging of richard wagner 's " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .
you grew up and learned there in the house .
what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .
ultimately , new impulses from the outside come in - the nuremberg system ca n't exist any more as it did and nuremberg changes at the end of the second act .
innovation collides with tradition , which for me is the most exiting issues in the opera , that these master singers are really a big art class .
and that 's one of the biggest questions : what 's the relationship between innovation and tradition , and art - or the artist - and society ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wait for years to get tickets in reference to you becoming the next festival director , your father has said , " if she can , then she should . "
how do you see this statement ?
that 's typical of my father .
whoever knows my father will know that that 's original wolfgang wagner .
although he said , " if she can and wants to . "
which conditions have to be met for you to accept the position ?
it does n't only depend on me .
it mostly depends on other people .
at the moment , my father is both manager and director in one and this constellation will change .
there will be four managers .
these four people have high expectations for a festival director , which i do n't know if i can fulfill .
it 's also a matter that needs to be discussed - what do the managers expect , what do i expect from them .
these things just all have to fit .
what 's the most important condition for you ?
that the artistic quality remains .

dw spoke with the most likely candidate , richard wagner 's great-granddaughter katharina . ever since wolfgang wagner , director of the bayreuth festival and the composer 's grandson , announced in 1999 that the search for a worthy successor was underway , festival fans and classical music connoisseurs have been hotly speculating on the lucky heir .
the 88-year-old impresario 's daughter katharina , 29 , now seems to have emerged as a favorite for the job , stepping ahead of her older sister eva and cousin nike , both twice her age .
katharina wagner will make her bayreuth festival directing debut on july 25 , the opening night , with her staging of richard wagner 's " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .
you grew up and learned there in the house .
what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .
ultimately , new impulses from the outside come in - the nuremberg system ca n't exist any more as it did and nuremberg changes at the end of the second act .
innovation collides with tradition , which for me is the most exiting issues in the opera , that these master singers are really a big art class .
and that 's one of the biggest questions : what 's the relationship between innovation and tradition , and art - or the artist - and society ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wait for years to get tickets in reference to you becoming the next festival director , your father has said , " if she can , then she should . "
how do you see this statement ?
that 's typical of my father .
whoever knows my father will know that that 's original wolfgang wagner .
although he said , " if she can and wants to . "
which conditions have to be met for you to accept the position ?
it does n't only depend on me .
it mostly depends on other people .
at the moment , my father is both manager and director in one and this constellation will change .
there will be four managers .
these four people have high expectations for a festival director , which i do n't know if i can fulfill .
it 's also a matter that needs to be discussed - what do the managers expect , what do i expect from them .
these things just all have to fit .
what 's the most important condition for you ?
that the artistic quality remains .

what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .
ultimately , new impulses from the outside come in - the nuremberg system ca n't exist any more as it did and nuremberg changes at the end of the second act .
innovation collides with tradition , which for me is the most exiting issues in the opera , that these master singers are really a big art class .
and that 's one of the biggest questions : what 's the relationship between innovation and tradition , and art - or the artist - and society ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wait for years to get tickets in reference to you becoming the next festival director , your father has said , " if she can , then she should . "
how do you see this statement ?
that 's typical of my father .
whoever knows my father will know that that 's original wolfgang wagner .
although he said , " if she can and wants to . "
which conditions have to be met for you to accept the position ?
it does n't only depend on me .
it mostly depends on other people .
at the moment , my father is both manager and director in one and this constellation will change .
there will be four managers .
these four people have high expectations for a festival director , which i do n't know if i can fulfill .
it 's also a matter that needs to be discussed - what do the managers expect , what do i expect from them .
these things just all have to fit .
what 's the most important condition for you ?
that the artistic quality remains .

as german chancellor angela merkel prepares to meet un representative to afghanistan tom koenigs on tuesday to discuss the situation , the debate over the future of german forces engaged in missions as part of the wider , us-led " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- rages behind the scenes .
merkel 's government has rejected all calls for its armed forces to be pulled out of afghanistan but those who are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition , such as the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens , are unlikely to be brushed off so easily .
the spd , the other party in merkel 's grand coalition government , are vociferously against the bundeswehr being involved in any us-controlled anti-terror operation , and the greens continue to hold their previous stance of rejecting out-right the mandate that sent german troops overseas as part of oef .
meanwhile , the left-wing alliance left party has called for an immediate removal of the armed forces .
public opinion is also being affected by the reports of increasing danger to germans overseas .
a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
at the moment , the government refuses to budge saying that the increased targeting of german personnel in afghanistan , both military and civilian , is a tactic employed by the taliban to provoke a debate over a withdrawal .
merkel and government staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the recent german casualties , merkel said german troops will stay in afghanistan merkel herself has said that the government will not respond to blackmail and that german troops were in afghanistan as a matter of international and domestic security .
" we are there because german security is also being protected over there , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" it is our concept to combine military issues with reconstruction . "
with the bundestag to decide on the extension of the bundeswehr 's mandate in afghanistan in the fall , some security experts , most notably the bundeswehr 's chief of staff wolfgang schneiderhan , have warned that the taliban is likely to increase its pressure in a bid to influence the outcome of the coming parliamentary debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs could not say if germans were specific targets however , speaking ahead of his meeting with merkel , un representative koenigs could not say whether there was a concerted effort to influence the debate by specifically targeting germans in afghanistan or if the current activity towards them will continue .
" the uprising is directed against the government as well as against the international community which it supports , " koenigs told german public broadcaster ndr .
" but i do not see a general hostility towards foreigners yet .
of course , those softer targets and those least defended , such as foreign tourists and workers , are in the most danger and this is certainly a problem . "
koenigs did , however , admit that the taliban was acutely aware of the power of its actions in the wider political domain .
" the taliban are of course very well versed in the media , " he added .
" and every reaction by a perceived enemy state is regarded as a victory and of course used as such .
these taliban forces are very engaged politically . "
koenigs in favor of extended german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs supports the bundeswehr 's mission the un representative also said he was in favor of keeping german troops in afghanistan and dismissed talk of " iraqization " - the concerted targeting of foreign nationals as kidnap victims and high-profile , ideologically motivated kills - in afghanistan .
he called on germany to extend its mandate when the time came , both military as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and as part of the reconstruction efforts .
" we have done the right thing , " koenigs said .

with the bundestag to decide on the extension of the bundeswehr 's mandate in afghanistan in the fall , some security experts , most notably the bundeswehr 's chief of staff wolfgang schneiderhan , have warned that the taliban is likely to increase its pressure in a bid to influence the outcome of the coming parliamentary debate .

as german chancellor angela merkel prepares to meet un representative to afghanistan tom koenigs on tuesday to discuss the situation , the debate over the future of german forces engaged in missions as part of the wider , us-led " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- rages behind the scenes .
merkel 's government has rejected all calls for its armed forces to be pulled out of afghanistan but those who are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition , such as the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens , are unlikely to be brushed off so easily .
the spd , the other party in merkel 's grand coalition government , are vociferously against the bundeswehr being involved in any us-controlled anti-terror operation , and the greens continue to hold their previous stance of rejecting out-right the mandate that sent german troops overseas as part of oef .
meanwhile , the left-wing alliance left party has called for an immediate removal of the armed forces .
public opinion is also being affected by the reports of increasing danger to germans overseas .
a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
at the moment , the government refuses to budge saying that the increased targeting of german personnel in afghanistan , both military and civilian , is a tactic employed by the taliban to provoke a debate over a withdrawal .
merkel and government staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the recent german casualties , merkel said german troops will stay in afghanistan merkel herself has said that the government will not respond to blackmail and that german troops were in afghanistan as a matter of international and domestic security .

" one can hardly say that it 's the result of a change of trend , " political scientist dieter oberndörfer of the university of freiburg told german news agency dpa .
slightly over a million people have assumed german nationality since the country 's new citizenship law came into effect in 2000 .
the numbers dropped steadily in subsequent years , with only 117,241 foreigners naturalized in 2005 .
turks made up the greatest number of new germans in 2006 , as in previous years , with around 33,500 changing their nationality .
around 12,600 former serbian and montenegrin nationals were in second place , 6,940 poles in third , and 4,690 people from russia in fourth .
they were followed by around 4,550 ukrainians , 4,310 israelis , 3,690 iraqis and 3,550 moroccans .
over 50 percent more israelis and 43 percent more people from serbia and montenegro became german in 2006 than in 2005 .

on the contrary , oberndörfer said most applicants were motivated to become german by outside factors such as the political situation in their countries of origin .
he said the increase in the numbers of israelis and people from serbia and montenegro who were naturalized had to do with the " growing insecurity in israel and a situation without perspectives in serbia . "

berlin has promised to maintain its efforts in the region . nations actively involved in rebuilding afghanistan need to stick to their promises , koenigs said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel on tuesday in berlin .
" afghanistan is a long-term commitment and the afghans expect us to live up to our obligations , " he said , describing the current situation as " extremely difficult . "
an increase in violence by remnants of the ousted taliban regime has seen a spate of attacks on nato-led peacekeepers as well as suicide bombings and kidnappings of foreigners .
un envoy calls for democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and tom koenigs address the press koenigs said the international community was determined to press ahead with the democratization process in afghanistan by " robust " means if necessary , including the use of military force .
he also said it was vital to check taliban resurgence in the south of the country under the mandate provided to the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
" we will need additional support in the near future because the threat is not yet over , " said koenigs , a german diplomat who is the special representative of un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
merkel : germany stands firm merkel pledged that germany would maintain its commitment to afghanistan , where taliban rebels are holding a german engineer hostage after another german died in their hands this week . " i feel confirmed in many efforts we are making , against the tremendous odds that we are constantly up against , " merkel said .
" this is a long-term , but very important and indisputable engagement . "
a government spokesman said the body of the man was expected to be flown back to germany on wednesday so that an autopsy could be conducted in cologne on thursday .
there were conflicting reports of whether he was shot or died of a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe the taliban is trying to force a german retreat reports reaching kabul on wednesday said the surviving hostage was in poor health and with no access to medical treatment .
the two engineers and five afghans were seized wednesday amid demands by the kidnappers that germany pull out of afghanistan . the german government rejected the demand and the rebels later sought the release of 10 taliban fighters from afghan detention .
there are 3,000 german troops deployed in northern afghanistan on provincial reconstruction missions .
there are also six german tornado warplanes carrying out surveillance missions for the isaf . the german defense ministry confirmed that the tornado aircraft helped locate the hostage , while afghan security forces were in the mountains but did not intervene . support needed for afghanistan 's neighbors both merkel and koenigs also appealed to the international community to increase assistance to afghanistan 's neighbors , particularly pakistan , where a recent upsurge in violence by islamic radicals and tribal militants is threatening the stability of president pervez musharraf 's government .
" the stability of one country depends on the development chances in neighboring countries , " merkel said . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one can hardly say that it 's the result of a change of trend , " political scientist dieter oberndörfer of the university of freiburg told german news agency dpa .
slightly over a million people have assumed german nationality since the country 's new citizenship law came into effect in 2000 .
the numbers dropped steadily in subsequent years , with only 117,241 foreigners naturalized in 2005 .
turks made up the greatest number of new germans in 2006 , as in previous years , with around 33,500 changing their nationality .
around 12,600 former serbian and montenegrin nationals were in second place , 6,940 poles in third , and 4,690 people from russia in fourth .
they were followed by around 4,550 ukrainians , 4,310 israelis , 3,690 iraqis and 3,550 moroccans .
over 50 percent more israelis and 43 percent more people from serbia and montenegro became german in 2006 than in 2005 .

he said the increase in the numbers of israelis and people from serbia and montenegro who were naturalized had to do with the " growing insecurity in israel and a situation without perspectives in serbia . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows dual allegiance , but not dual citizenship people do n't appear to have been mainly attracted to assume the country 's citizenship by the desire to become german .
on the contrary , oberndörfer said most applicants were motivated to become german by outside factors such as the political situation in their countries of origin .
he said the increase in the numbers of israelis and people from serbia and montenegro who were naturalized had to do with the " growing insecurity in israel and a situation without perspectives in serbia . "
foreigners can apply to be naturalized as germans after eight years as legal immigrants , but germany does not grant them citizenship unless they legally abandon their old nationality . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu " stands ready to play an active role " in an international middle east peace conference in autumn proposed by the united states and backed by middle east mediators last week , eu foreign ministers said in a statement on monday after a meeting in brussels .
eu top diplomat javier solana said that the idea of such a conference had always been in the mind of the eu and that the bloc was " completely in favor of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters that the meeting would be an opportunity to draw conclusions " on how we can move ahead on the way to a two-state solution . "
while eu foreign chiefs welcomed israel 's recent move to release 255 palestinian prisoners and the partial transfer of palestinian tax and custom revenues , they called for " the immediate , complete and regular release of the remaining and future funds . "
the eu-27 also urged israel " to take further steps to meet the commitments " towards the palestinians , including a removal of checkpoints and barriers in the west bank .
full support for abbas ministers confirmed the eu 's " full support " for palestinian president mahmoud abbas .

" the eu opposes any division of the palestinian territories and confirms its readiness to engage with all palestinian parties whose policy and actions reflect the -lsb- middle east -rsb- quartet principles , " they said .
members of the quartet last week said they would not talk to hamas , repeating that the militant group - which has seized control of the gaza strip from abbas ' forces - must first recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce terrorism and sign up to past agreements with israel .
funds still unreleased eu ministers said that the bloc was committed " to help build the institutions and economy of the future palestinian state . "
unlike washington , the eu has yet to release millions of dollars in direct aid to the fatah-led palestinian government .
the funds were frozen after last year 's hamas electoral victory .
the militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the us .
the eu has , however , been channeling aid for the palestinian health and security sector through non-governmental aid groups .

the international olympic committee is expected to name the host for the 2018 olympics in 2011 .
munich mayor christian ude welcomed the announcement , saying " a major and important hurdle has been cleared on our way to becoming an olympic city once again . "
the bavarian capital hosted the 1972 summer olympics and would become the first city to host a winter and summer games if it puts together a successful bid .
ude announced that the winter resort of garmisch-partenkirchen , situated in the alps south of munich , would definitely be part of any bid and he also refused to rule out other locations .
munich intended to put together a " compact " bid , he said , citing the canadian city of vancouver , host of the 2010 games , as the role model .
dosb aware of mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb will make sure nothing goes wrong this time " a good bid needs a clear concept and a clear financing structure , " said dosb general director michael vesper , while bach estimated the bid budget at between 25 million and 35 million euros -lrb- $ 34.5 million to $ 48.4 million -rrb- .
" but we should n't restrict ourselves to a bid that simply puts superb sports venues in places , we also need an inspiring idea , " said bach .
they also need things to run smoothly once that idea is in place .
germany 's most recent olympic bids have been mired in controversy - and failure - despite having impressive plans to offer .
the joint leipzig / rostock bid for the 2012 games struggled to even make the voting for the candidate cities in 2004 after being crippled by scandals involving alleged financial irregularities and the bid organizers ' ties to the stasi , the former east german secret police .
stasi rumors and dodgy dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's bid for 2012 went up in flames first were the allegations surrounding dirk thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , concerning his past involvement with the stasi .
thärichen resigned from the post in 2003 .
then harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly-run olympic marketing committee , resigned soon after , dogged by similar stasi speculation and allegations of complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
he was followed through the exit by burkhard jung , the city official who represented leipzig during the city ’ s successful bid to become the german candidate before becoming a supervisory board member of the company overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
he stepped down from his position after allegations he was involved in illegal commission payments worth 150,000 euros made to a marketing company while leipzig was bidding to represent germany .
the heads kept rolling with wolfram köhler , the state secretary for saxony , who resigned after he had come under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa .
berlin hampered by cold war legacy berlin 's efforts to get the 2000 olympic games ended in humiliation , when it came last among the six countries vying for the honor .
the newly unified capital 's bid floundered on its inadequate infrastructure , which had suffered during the divisions of the cold war .
while berlin attempted to catch up with its rival bidders by embarking on ambitious building projects , the city was too far behind the pack to get the olympic nod and the games eventually went to sydney .
now , after hosting a hugely successful world cup in 2006 , germany 's big event credentials have sky-rocketed and the dosb hopes to tap into that and put the disappointment of the past behind it . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one can hardly say that it 's the result of a change of trend , " political scientist dieter oberndörfer of the university of freiburg told german news agency dpa .
slightly over a million people have assumed german nationality since the country 's new citizenship law came into effect in 2000 .
the numbers dropped steadily in subsequent years , with only 117,241 foreigners naturalized in 2005 .
turks made up the greatest number of new germans in 2006 , as in previous years , with around 33,500 changing their nationality .
around 12,600 former serbian and montenegrin nationals were in second place , 6,940 poles in third , and 4,690 people from russia in fourth .
they were followed by around 4,550 ukrainians , 4,310 israelis , 3,690 iraqis and 3,550 moroccans .
over 50 percent more israelis and 43 percent more people from serbia and montenegro became german in 2006 than in 2005 .
motivated by outside factors experts expect that the number of turkish applicants will fall as turkey intensifies its ties to the european union .
as turkey has associate membership status with the eu , there are few areas in which turkish nationals experience disadvantages in relation to eu nations , oberndörfer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows dual allegiance , but not dual citizenship people do n't appear to have been mainly attracted to assume the country 's citizenship by the desire to become german .
on the contrary , oberndörfer said most applicants were motivated to become german by outside factors such as the political situation in their countries of origin .
he said the increase in the numbers of israelis and people from serbia and montenegro who were naturalized had to do with the " growing insecurity in israel and a situation without perspectives in serbia . "
foreigners can apply to be naturalized as germans after eight years as legal immigrants , but germany does not grant them citizenship unless they legally abandon their old nationality . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu " stands ready to play an active role " in an international middle east peace conference in autumn proposed by the united states and backed by middle east mediators last week , eu foreign ministers said in a statement on monday after a meeting in brussels .

a statement by portugal , as current eu president , praised libya for its " constructive attitude " and noted " the potential of increased eu-libya cooperation in many areas of common interest . "
the eu was committed to working on the framework of future eu-libya relations , the statement added .
european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters he wanted a " further normalization " of relations with libya but gave no indication of what this would involve .
officials said further work on building better ties with libya would be done by eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who played a key role in securing the release of the medics , five nurses and a doctor .
" this decision will open the way for a new and enhanced relationship between the eu and libya , " said ferrero-waldner , adding ties would also be reinforced with north african states .

" this news will ... assist in the normalization of relations and open the possibility for closer cooperation through the euro-mediterranean partnership , " watson said .
he warned , however , that libya still had to demonstrate that it could be a reliable partner in the long term .
relations between the eu and libya have improved in recent years , but the country is not a member of the bloc 's 11-year-old euro-mediterranean -lrb- euro-med -rrb- partnership which covers all other north african countries .

libya is also not included in the eu 's so-called " neighborhood policy " under which states on the bloc 's southern and eastern borders receive financial aid for political and economic reform .

berlin and hamburg failed to win the group 's support to host summer games . the dosb refused to support any potential bid by hamburg or berlin to host the 2016 or 2020 summer games in the wake of failed bids by berlin for the 2000 and leipzig for the 2012 events .
" we have reached the decision that we view very positively a possible bid for a winter olympics under the umbrella of the city of munich , " dosb president thomas bach said tuesday in frankfurt where the organization 's executive committee is meeting .
the final decision will be made at the dosb congress in december .
the international olympic committee is expected to name the host for the 2018 olympics in 2011 .
munich mayor christian ude welcomed the announcement , saying " a major and important hurdle has been cleared on our way to becoming an olympic city once again . "
the bavarian capital hosted the 1972 summer olympics and would become the first city to host a winter and summer games if it puts together a successful bid .
ude announced that the winter resort of garmisch-partenkirchen , situated in the alps south of munich , would definitely be part of any bid and he also refused to rule out other locations .
munich intended to put together a " compact " bid , he said , citing the canadian city of vancouver , host of the 2010 games , as the role model .
dosb aware of mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb will make sure nothing goes wrong this time " a good bid needs a clear concept and a clear financing structure , " said dosb general director michael vesper , while bach estimated the bid budget at between 25 million and 35 million euros -lrb- $ 34.5 million to $ 48.4 million -rrb- .
" but we should n't restrict ourselves to a bid that simply puts superb sports venues in places , we also need an inspiring idea , " said bach .
they also need things to run smoothly once that idea is in place .
germany 's most recent olympic bids have been mired in controversy - and failure - despite having impressive plans to offer .
the joint leipzig / rostock bid for the 2012 games struggled to even make the voting for the candidate cities in 2004 after being crippled by scandals involving alleged financial irregularities and the bid organizers ' ties to the stasi , the former east german secret police .
stasi rumors and dodgy dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's bid for 2012 went up in flames first were the allegations surrounding dirk thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , concerning his past involvement with the stasi .
thärichen resigned from the post in 2003 .
then harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly-run olympic marketing committee , resigned soon after , dogged by similar stasi speculation and allegations of complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
he was followed through the exit by burkhard jung , the city official who represented leipzig during the city ’ s successful bid to become the german candidate before becoming a supervisory board member of the company overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
he stepped down from his position after allegations he was involved in illegal commission payments worth 150,000 euros made to a marketing company while leipzig was bidding to represent germany .
the heads kept rolling with wolfram köhler , the state secretary for saxony , who resigned after he had come under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa .
berlin hampered by cold war legacy berlin 's efforts to get the 2000 olympic games ended in humiliation , when it came last among the six countries vying for the honor .
the newly unified capital 's bid floundered on its inadequate infrastructure , which had suffered during the divisions of the cold war .
while berlin attempted to catch up with its rival bidders by embarking on ambitious building projects , the city was too far behind the pack to get the olympic nod and the games eventually went to sydney .

berlin and hamburg failed to win the group 's support to host summer games . the dosb refused to support any potential bid by hamburg or berlin to host the 2016 or 2020 summer games in the wake of failed bids by berlin for the 2000 and leipzig for the 2012 events .
" we have reached the decision that we view very positively a possible bid for a winter olympics under the umbrella of the city of munich , " dosb president thomas bach said tuesday in frankfurt where the organization 's executive committee is meeting .
the final decision will be made at the dosb congress in december .
the international olympic committee is expected to name the host for the 2018 olympics in 2011 .
munich mayor christian ude welcomed the announcement , saying " a major and important hurdle has been cleared on our way to becoming an olympic city once again . "
the bavarian capital hosted the 1972 summer olympics and would become the first city to host a winter and summer games if it puts together a successful bid .
ude announced that the winter resort of garmisch-partenkirchen , situated in the alps south of munich , would definitely be part of any bid and he also refused to rule out other locations .
munich intended to put together a " compact " bid , he said , citing the canadian city of vancouver , host of the 2010 games , as the role model .
dosb aware of mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb will make sure nothing goes wrong this time " a good bid needs a clear concept and a clear financing structure , " said dosb general director michael vesper , while bach estimated the bid budget at between 25 million and 35 million euros -lrb- $ 34.5 million to $ 48.4 million -rrb- .
" but we should n't restrict ourselves to a bid that simply puts superb sports venues in places , we also need an inspiring idea , " said bach .
they also need things to run smoothly once that idea is in place .
germany 's most recent olympic bids have been mired in controversy - and failure - despite having impressive plans to offer .
the joint leipzig / rostock bid for the 2012 games struggled to even make the voting for the candidate cities in 2004 after being crippled by scandals involving alleged financial irregularities and the bid organizers ' ties to the stasi , the former east german secret police .
stasi rumors and dodgy dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's bid for 2012 went up in flames first were the allegations surrounding dirk thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , concerning his past involvement with the stasi .
thärichen resigned from the post in 2003 .
then harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly-run olympic marketing committee , resigned soon after , dogged by similar stasi speculation and allegations of complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
he was followed through the exit by burkhard jung , the city official who represented leipzig during the city ’ s successful bid to become the german candidate before becoming a supervisory board member of the company overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
he stepped down from his position after allegations he was involved in illegal commission payments worth 150,000 euros made to a marketing company while leipzig was bidding to represent germany .
the heads kept rolling with wolfram köhler , the state secretary for saxony , who resigned after he had come under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa .
berlin hampered by cold war legacy berlin 's efforts to get the 2000 olympic games ended in humiliation , when it came last among the six countries vying for the honor .
the newly unified capital 's bid floundered on its inadequate infrastructure , which had suffered during the divisions of the cold war .
while berlin attempted to catch up with its rival bidders by embarking on ambitious building projects , the city was too far behind the pack to get the olympic nod and the games eventually went to sydney .
now , after hosting a hugely successful world cup in 2006 , germany 's big event credentials have sky-rocketed and the dosb hopes to tap into that and put the disappointment of the past behind it . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with the most likely candidate , richard wagner 's great-granddaughter katharina . ever since wolfgang wagner , director of the bayreuth festival and the composer 's grandson , announced in 1999 that the search for a worthy successor was underway , festival fans and classical music connoisseurs have been hotly speculating on the lucky heir .
the 88-year-old impresario 's daughter katharina , 29 , now seems to have emerged as a favorite for the job , stepping ahead of her older sister eva and cousin nike , both twice her age .
katharina wagner will make her bayreuth festival directing debut on july 25 , the opening night , with her staging of richard wagner 's " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .
you grew up and learned there in the house .
what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .
ultimately , new impulses from the outside come in - the nuremberg system ca n't exist any more as it did and nuremberg changes at the end of the second act .
innovation collides with tradition , which for me is the most exiting issues in the opera , that these master singers are really a big art class .
and that 's one of the biggest questions : what 's the relationship between innovation and tradition , and art - or the artist - and society ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wait for years to get tickets in reference to you becoming the next festival director , your father has said , " if she can , then she should . "
how do you see this statement ?
that 's typical of my father .
whoever knows my father will know that that 's original wolfgang wagner .
although he said , " if she can and wants to . "
which conditions have to be met for you to accept the position ?
it does n't only depend on me .
it mostly depends on other people .
at the moment , my father is both manager and director in one and this constellation will change .
there will be four managers .
these four people have high expectations for a festival director , which i do n't know if i can fulfill .
it 's also a matter that needs to be discussed - what do the managers expect , what do i expect from them .
these things just all have to fit .
what 's the most important condition for you ?
that the artistic quality remains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.07.2007 eu plans upgraded ties with libya after medics ' release großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking up for realtions between the eu and gadhafi 's libya the european union on tuesday promised to upgrade political and economic ties with libya after authorities in tripoli released six bulgarian medics who had been sentenced to life in prison there . details of just how - and how fast - the so-far stagnant eu-libyan relationship will be improved were still being considered , officials said .
a statement by portugal , as current eu president , praised libya for its " constructive attitude " and noted " the potential of increased eu-libya cooperation in many areas of common interest . "
the eu was committed to working on the framework of future eu-libya relations , the statement added .
european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters he wanted a " further normalization " of relations with libya but gave no indication of what this would involve .
officials said further work on building better ties with libya would be done by eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who played a key role in securing the release of the medics , five nurses and a doctor .
" this decision will open the way for a new and enhanced relationship between the eu and libya , " said ferrero-waldner , adding ties would also be reinforced with north african states .
but is libya reliable ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner played a large role in the medics release graham watson , the leader of the european parliament 's liberal group , said libya 's decision to free the medics meant the country would not return to international isolation .
" this news will ... assist in the normalization of relations and open the possibility for closer cooperation through the euro-mediterranean partnership , " watson said .
he warned , however , that libya still had to demonstrate that it could be a reliable partner in the long term .
relations between the eu and libya have improved in recent years , but the country is not a member of the bloc 's 11-year-old euro-mediterranean -lrb- euro-med -rrb- partnership which covers all other north african countries .
eu diplomats have long argued that libya does not meet the human rights and democracy standards required to join the euro-med relationship .
but the country has been given observer status when attending euro-med meetings .
libya is also not included in the eu 's so-called " neighborhood policy " under which states on the bloc 's southern and eastern borders receive financial aid for political and economic reform .
change after un sanctions lifted eu relations with libya began to improve slowly following the lifting of un sanctions against tripoli in september 2003 , and libyan leader moammar gadhafi visited eu institutions in april 2004 .
in october of that year , eu governments repealed so-called " restrictive measures " against libya adopted as part of the un framework and also lifted an arms embargo against the country introduced in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the medics arrived in sofia , bulgaria , tuesday morning recently , the european commission , italy and other eu states have sought libyan help in combating the flow of illegal african immigrants to the eu .
several eu member states have extensive trade relations with libya .
italy , germany , britain and france are libya 's four leading suppliers of manufactured goods , energy and food products and raw materials .
italy , germany , spain , france and greece are libya 's top five export markets , taking in about 78 percent of the country 's exports of energy , food products and raw materials .
help for sick children eu medical assistance has been given to victims of hiv / aids at benghazi hospital .
in 1999 , the medics were declared guilty of deliberately infecting hundreds of children there with the virus .
they received a pardon from bulgarian president georgi parvanov on tuesday - a sign of bulgaria 's acceptance of the group 's complete innocence in the infections of the children .
experts say the aids outbreak at benghazi children 's hospital was caused by bad hygiene . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin has promised to maintain its efforts in the region . nations actively involved in rebuilding afghanistan need to stick to their promises , koenigs said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel on tuesday in berlin .
" afghanistan is a long-term commitment and the afghans expect us to live up to our obligations , " he said , describing the current situation as " extremely difficult . "
an increase in violence by remnants of the ousted taliban regime has seen a spate of attacks on nato-led peacekeepers as well as suicide bombings and kidnappings of foreigners .
un envoy calls for democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and tom koenigs address the press koenigs said the international community was determined to press ahead with the democratization process in afghanistan by " robust " means if necessary , including the use of military force .
he also said it was vital to check taliban resurgence in the south of the country under the mandate provided to the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
" we will need additional support in the near future because the threat is not yet over , " said koenigs , a german diplomat who is the special representative of un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
merkel : germany stands firm merkel pledged that germany would maintain its commitment to afghanistan , where taliban rebels are holding a german engineer hostage after another german died in their hands this week . " i feel confirmed in many efforts we are making , against the tremendous odds that we are constantly up against , " merkel said .
" this is a long-term , but very important and indisputable engagement . "
a government spokesman said the body of the man was expected to be flown back to germany on wednesday so that an autopsy could be conducted in cologne on thursday .
there were conflicting reports of whether he was shot or died of a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe the taliban is trying to force a german retreat reports reaching kabul on wednesday said the surviving hostage was in poor health and with no access to medical treatment .
the two engineers and five afghans were seized wednesday amid demands by the kidnappers that germany pull out of afghanistan . the german government rejected the demand and the rebels later sought the release of 10 taliban fighters from afghan detention .
there are 3,000 german troops deployed in northern afghanistan on provincial reconstruction missions .
there are also six german tornado warplanes carrying out surveillance missions for the isaf . the german defense ministry confirmed that the tornado aircraft helped locate the hostage , while afghan security forces were in the mountains but did not intervene . support needed for afghanistan 's neighbors both merkel and koenigs also appealed to the international community to increase assistance to afghanistan 's neighbors , particularly pakistan , where a recent upsurge in violence by islamic radicals and tribal militants is threatening the stability of president pervez musharraf 's government .

berlin and hamburg failed to win the group 's support to host summer games . the dosb refused to support any potential bid by hamburg or berlin to host the 2016 or 2020 summer games in the wake of failed bids by berlin for the 2000 and leipzig for the 2012 events .
" we have reached the decision that we view very positively a possible bid for a winter olympics under the umbrella of the city of munich , " dosb president thomas bach said tuesday in frankfurt where the organization 's executive committee is meeting .
the final decision will be made at the dosb congress in december .
the international olympic committee is expected to name the host for the 2018 olympics in 2011 .
munich mayor christian ude welcomed the announcement , saying " a major and important hurdle has been cleared on our way to becoming an olympic city once again . "
the bavarian capital hosted the 1972 summer olympics and would become the first city to host a winter and summer games if it puts together a successful bid .
ude announced that the winter resort of garmisch-partenkirchen , situated in the alps south of munich , would definitely be part of any bid and he also refused to rule out other locations .
munich intended to put together a " compact " bid , he said , citing the canadian city of vancouver , host of the 2010 games , as the role model .
dosb aware of mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb will make sure nothing goes wrong this time " a good bid needs a clear concept and a clear financing structure , " said dosb general director michael vesper , while bach estimated the bid budget at between 25 million and 35 million euros -lrb- $ 34.5 million to $ 48.4 million -rrb- .
" but we should n't restrict ourselves to a bid that simply puts superb sports venues in places , we also need an inspiring idea , " said bach .
they also need things to run smoothly once that idea is in place .
germany 's most recent olympic bids have been mired in controversy - and failure - despite having impressive plans to offer .
the joint leipzig / rostock bid for the 2012 games struggled to even make the voting for the candidate cities in 2004 after being crippled by scandals involving alleged financial irregularities and the bid organizers ' ties to the stasi , the former east german secret police .
stasi rumors and dodgy dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's bid for 2012 went up in flames first were the allegations surrounding dirk thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , concerning his past involvement with the stasi .
thärichen resigned from the post in 2003 .
then harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly-run olympic marketing committee , resigned soon after , dogged by similar stasi speculation and allegations of complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
he was followed through the exit by burkhard jung , the city official who represented leipzig during the city ’ s successful bid to become the german candidate before becoming a supervisory board member of the company overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
he stepped down from his position after allegations he was involved in illegal commission payments worth 150,000 euros made to a marketing company while leipzig was bidding to represent germany .
the heads kept rolling with wolfram köhler , the state secretary for saxony , who resigned after he had come under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa .
berlin hampered by cold war legacy berlin 's efforts to get the 2000 olympic games ended in humiliation , when it came last among the six countries vying for the honor .
the newly unified capital 's bid floundered on its inadequate infrastructure , which had suffered during the divisions of the cold war .
while berlin attempted to catch up with its rival bidders by embarking on ambitious building projects , the city was too far behind the pack to get the olympic nod and the games eventually went to sydney .
now , after hosting a hugely successful world cup in 2006 , germany 's big event credentials have sky-rocketed and the dosb hopes to tap into that and put the disappointment of the past behind it . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : behind the scenes at the bayreuth festival katarina wagner 's bayreuth debut elicits boos and bravos alike wagners want to keep bayreuth festival in the family going backstage with bayreuth festival singers classical music -pipe- 24.07.2007 " i stay out of all the wagner family disputes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner directed the " meistersinger " for this year 's bayreuth festival who will be the next to take the throne at the world-famous wagner festival in bayreuth , which starts wedensday ?
dw spoke with the most likely candidate , richard wagner 's great-granddaughter katharina . ever since wolfgang wagner , director of the bayreuth festival and the composer 's grandson , announced in 1999 that the search for a worthy successor was underway , festival fans and classical music connoisseurs have been hotly speculating on the lucky heir .
the 88-year-old impresario 's daughter katharina , 29 , now seems to have emerged as a favorite for the job , stepping ahead of her older sister eva and cousin nike , both twice her age .
katharina wagner will make her bayreuth festival directing debut on july 25 , the opening night , with her staging of richard wagner 's " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .
you grew up and learned there in the house .
what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .

dw spoke with the most likely candidate , richard wagner 's great-granddaughter katharina . ever since wolfgang wagner , director of the bayreuth festival and the composer 's grandson , announced in 1999 that the search for a worthy successor was underway , festival fans and classical music connoisseurs have been hotly speculating on the lucky heir .
the 88-year-old impresario 's daughter katharina , 29 , now seems to have emerged as a favorite for the job , stepping ahead of her older sister eva and cousin nike , both twice her age .
katharina wagner will make her bayreuth festival directing debut on july 25 , the opening night , with her staging of richard wagner 's " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .
you grew up and learned there in the house .
what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .
ultimately , new impulses from the outside come in - the nuremberg system ca n't exist any more as it did and nuremberg changes at the end of the second act .
innovation collides with tradition , which for me is the most exiting issues in the opera , that these master singers are really a big art class .
and that 's one of the biggest questions : what 's the relationship between innovation and tradition , and art - or the artist - and society ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wait for years to get tickets in reference to you becoming the next festival director , your father has said , " if she can , then she should . "

" one can hardly say that it 's the result of a change of trend , " political scientist dieter oberndörfer of the university of freiburg told german news agency dpa .
slightly over a million people have assumed german nationality since the country 's new citizenship law came into effect in 2000 .
the numbers dropped steadily in subsequent years , with only 117,241 foreigners naturalized in 2005 .
turks made up the greatest number of new germans in 2006 , as in previous years , with around 33,500 changing their nationality .
around 12,600 former serbian and montenegrin nationals were in second place , 6,940 poles in third , and 4,690 people from russia in fourth .
they were followed by around 4,550 ukrainians , 4,310 israelis , 3,690 iraqis and 3,550 moroccans .
over 50 percent more israelis and 43 percent more people from serbia and montenegro became german in 2006 than in 2005 .
motivated by outside factors experts expect that the number of turkish applicants will fall as turkey intensifies its ties to the european union .
as turkey has associate membership status with the eu , there are few areas in which turkish nationals experience disadvantages in relation to eu nations , oberndörfer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows dual allegiance , but not dual citizenship people do n't appear to have been mainly attracted to assume the country 's citizenship by the desire to become german .
on the contrary , oberndörfer said most applicants were motivated to become german by outside factors such as the political situation in their countries of origin .
he said the increase in the numbers of israelis and people from serbia and montenegro who were naturalized had to do with the " growing insecurity in israel and a situation without perspectives in serbia . "
foreigners can apply to be naturalized as germans after eight years as legal immigrants , but germany does not grant them citizenship unless they legally abandon their old nationality . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin has promised to maintain its efforts in the region . nations actively involved in rebuilding afghanistan need to stick to their promises , koenigs said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel on tuesday in berlin .
" afghanistan is a long-term commitment and the afghans expect us to live up to our obligations , " he said , describing the current situation as " extremely difficult . "
an increase in violence by remnants of the ousted taliban regime has seen a spate of attacks on nato-led peacekeepers as well as suicide bombings and kidnappings of foreigners .
un envoy calls for democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and tom koenigs address the press koenigs said the international community was determined to press ahead with the democratization process in afghanistan by " robust " means if necessary , including the use of military force .
he also said it was vital to check taliban resurgence in the south of the country under the mandate provided to the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
" we will need additional support in the near future because the threat is not yet over , " said koenigs , a german diplomat who is the special representative of un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
merkel : germany stands firm merkel pledged that germany would maintain its commitment to afghanistan , where taliban rebels are holding a german engineer hostage after another german died in their hands this week . " i feel confirmed in many efforts we are making , against the tremendous odds that we are constantly up against , " merkel said .
" this is a long-term , but very important and indisputable engagement . "
a government spokesman said the body of the man was expected to be flown back to germany on wednesday so that an autopsy could be conducted in cologne on thursday .
there were conflicting reports of whether he was shot or died of a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe the taliban is trying to force a german retreat reports reaching kabul on wednesday said the surviving hostage was in poor health and with no access to medical treatment .
the two engineers and five afghans were seized wednesday amid demands by the kidnappers that germany pull out of afghanistan . the german government rejected the demand and the rebels later sought the release of 10 taliban fighters from afghan detention .
there are 3,000 german troops deployed in northern afghanistan on provincial reconstruction missions .
there are also six german tornado warplanes carrying out surveillance missions for the isaf . the german defense ministry confirmed that the tornado aircraft helped locate the hostage , while afghan security forces were in the mountains but did not intervene . support needed for afghanistan 's neighbors both merkel and koenigs also appealed to the international community to increase assistance to afghanistan 's neighbors , particularly pakistan , where a recent upsurge in violence by islamic radicals and tribal militants is threatening the stability of president pervez musharraf 's government .

berlin and hamburg failed to win the group 's support to host summer games . the dosb refused to support any potential bid by hamburg or berlin to host the 2016 or 2020 summer games in the wake of failed bids by berlin for the 2000 and leipzig for the 2012 events .
" we have reached the decision that we view very positively a possible bid for a winter olympics under the umbrella of the city of munich , " dosb president thomas bach said tuesday in frankfurt where the organization 's executive committee is meeting .
the final decision will be made at the dosb congress in december .
the international olympic committee is expected to name the host for the 2018 olympics in 2011 .
munich mayor christian ude welcomed the announcement , saying " a major and important hurdle has been cleared on our way to becoming an olympic city once again . "
the bavarian capital hosted the 1972 summer olympics and would become the first city to host a winter and summer games if it puts together a successful bid .
ude announced that the winter resort of garmisch-partenkirchen , situated in the alps south of munich , would definitely be part of any bid and he also refused to rule out other locations .
munich intended to put together a " compact " bid , he said , citing the canadian city of vancouver , host of the 2010 games , as the role model .
dosb aware of mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb will make sure nothing goes wrong this time " a good bid needs a clear concept and a clear financing structure , " said dosb general director michael vesper , while bach estimated the bid budget at between 25 million and 35 million euros -lrb- $ 34.5 million to $ 48.4 million -rrb- .
" but we should n't restrict ourselves to a bid that simply puts superb sports venues in places , we also need an inspiring idea , " said bach .
they also need things to run smoothly once that idea is in place .
germany 's most recent olympic bids have been mired in controversy - and failure - despite having impressive plans to offer .
the joint leipzig / rostock bid for the 2012 games struggled to even make the voting for the candidate cities in 2004 after being crippled by scandals involving alleged financial irregularities and the bid organizers ' ties to the stasi , the former east german secret police .
stasi rumors and dodgy dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's bid for 2012 went up in flames first were the allegations surrounding dirk thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , concerning his past involvement with the stasi .
thärichen resigned from the post in 2003 .
then harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly-run olympic marketing committee , resigned soon after , dogged by similar stasi speculation and allegations of complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
he was followed through the exit by burkhard jung , the city official who represented leipzig during the city ’ s successful bid to become the german candidate before becoming a supervisory board member of the company overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
he stepped down from his position after allegations he was involved in illegal commission payments worth 150,000 euros made to a marketing company while leipzig was bidding to represent germany .
the heads kept rolling with wolfram köhler , the state secretary for saxony , who resigned after he had come under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa .
berlin hampered by cold war legacy berlin 's efforts to get the 2000 olympic games ended in humiliation , when it came last among the six countries vying for the honor .
the newly unified capital 's bid floundered on its inadequate infrastructure , which had suffered during the divisions of the cold war .
while berlin attempted to catch up with its rival bidders by embarking on ambitious building projects , the city was too far behind the pack to get the olympic nod and the games eventually went to sydney .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : behind the scenes at the bayreuth festival katarina wagner 's bayreuth debut elicits boos and bravos alike wagners want to keep bayreuth festival in the family going backstage with bayreuth festival singers classical -pipe- 24.07.2007 " i stay out of all the wagner family disputes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner directed the " meistersinger " for this year 's bayreuth festival who will be the next to take the throne at the world-famous wagner festival in bayreuth , which starts wedensday ?
dw spoke with the most likely candidate , richard wagner 's great-granddaughter katharina . ever since wolfgang wagner , director of the bayreuth festival and the composer 's grandson , announced in 1999 that the search for a worthy successor was underway , festival fans and classical music connoisseurs have been hotly speculating on the lucky heir .
the 88-year-old impresario 's daughter katharina , 29 , now seems to have emerged as a favorite for the job , stepping ahead of her older sister eva and cousin nike , both twice her age .
katharina wagner will make her bayreuth festival directing debut on july 25 , the opening night , with her staging of richard wagner 's " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .
you grew up and learned there in the house .
what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .
ultimately , new impulses from the outside come in - the nuremberg system ca n't exist any more as it did and nuremberg changes at the end of the second act .
innovation collides with tradition , which for me is the most exiting issues in the opera , that these master singers are really a big art class .
and that 's one of the biggest questions : what 's the relationship between innovation and tradition , and art - or the artist - and society ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wait for years to get tickets in reference to you becoming the next festival director , your father has said , " if she can , then she should . "
how do you see this statement ?
that 's typical of my father .
whoever knows my father will know that that 's original wolfgang wagner .
although he said , " if she can and wants to . "
which conditions have to be met for you to accept the position ?
it does n't only depend on me .
it mostly depends on other people .
at the moment , my father is both manager and director in one and this constellation will change .
there will be four managers .
these four people have high expectations for a festival director , which i do n't know if i can fulfill .
it 's also a matter that needs to be discussed - what do the managers expect , what do i expect from them .
these things just all have to fit .
what 's the most important condition for you ?
that the artistic quality remains .

dw spoke with the most likely candidate , richard wagner 's great-granddaughter katharina . ever since wolfgang wagner , director of the bayreuth festival and the composer 's grandson , announced in 1999 that the search for a worthy successor was underway , festival fans and classical music connoisseurs have been hotly speculating on the lucky heir .
the 88-year-old impresario 's daughter katharina , 29 , now seems to have emerged as a favorite for the job , stepping ahead of her older sister eva and cousin nike , both twice her age .
katharina wagner will make her bayreuth festival directing debut on july 25 , the opening night , with her staging of richard wagner 's " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .
you grew up and learned there in the house .
what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?

the state will retain majority control , but fears are rife that local service , in particular , will suffer . the cabinet decision envisions the government selling off a quarter of deutsche bahn shares by the beginning of 2009 .
another 24 percent could also be sold - according to the german constitution , the state is obliged to retain a majority holding as part of its duty to provide germany with rail services . " with this decision , we 've taken a huge step toward implementing the government 's rail reform program , " said german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in berlin on tuesday . the government estimates that selling a 25 percent stake in the german rail company would bring in some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- .
deutsch bahn is europe 's largest rail company and services almost 1.9 billion passengers a year .
it also handles 300 million tons of freight annually .
last year it made some 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- in profits . the cabinet also decided the deutsche bahn would retain control of the track network for the next 15 years . if the flotation goes through , it would be the biggest since the sale of deutsche post stock in 2000 .
but the government 's plan will have to be approved by both houses of the german parliament . hard fight ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn employees held strikes recently for more money but it is by no means certain that the proposed ipo will go ahead amidst protests from local governments , unions and consumer groups .
many fear severe disruptions to services such as occurred in previous privatizations - most notably that of british rail in the 1980 and 90s . contentious issues include the potential canceling of local routes and job losses . " we 're afraid the deutsche bahn will cherry-pick the profitable , long-distance routes between the big cities , " said the head of the german association of cities and towns , gerd landsberg .
" that would also endanger the necessary expansion of jobs in rural areas .
that 's unacceptable . " " the privatization of deutsche bahn threatens to derail the central goal of the rail reform , namely to get more people to use train services , " added german union association board member claus matecki . consumer advocacy groups also fear that privatization could mean price hikes and have called on parliamentarians to reject the proposed flotation . but one union representing rail workers , who have staged strikes recently for better pay , said it welcomed the partial privatization . article based on news reports -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 88-year-old impresario 's daughter katharina , 29 , now seems to have emerged as a favorite for the job , stepping ahead of her older sister eva and cousin nike , both twice her age .
katharina wagner will make her bayreuth festival directing debut on july 25 , the opening night , with her staging of richard wagner 's " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .
you grew up and learned there in the house .
what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .
ultimately , new impulses from the outside come in - the nuremberg system ca n't exist any more as it did and nuremberg changes at the end of the second act .
innovation collides with tradition , which for me is the most exiting issues in the opera , that these master singers are really a big art class .
and that 's one of the biggest questions : what 's the relationship between innovation and tradition , and art - or the artist - and society ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wait for years to get tickets in reference to you becoming the next festival director , your father has said , " if she can , then she should . "
how do you see this statement ?
that 's typical of my father .
whoever knows my father will know that that 's original wolfgang wagner .
although he said , " if she can and wants to . "
which conditions have to be met for you to accept the position ?
it does n't only depend on me .
it mostly depends on other people .
at the moment , my father is both manager and director in one and this constellation will change .
there will be four managers .
these four people have high expectations for a festival director , which i do n't know if i can fulfill .
it 's also a matter that needs to be discussed - what do the managers expect , what do i expect from them .
these things just all have to fit .
what 's the most important condition for you ?
that the artistic quality remains .

the state will retain majority control , but fears are rife that local service , in particular , will suffer . the cabinet decision envisions the government selling off a quarter of deutsche bahn shares by the beginning of 2009 .
another 24 percent could also be sold - according to the german constitution , the state is obliged to retain a majority holding as part of its duty to provide germany with rail services . " with this decision , we 've taken a huge step toward implementing the government 's rail reform program , " said german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in berlin on tuesday . the government estimates that selling a 25 percent stake in the german rail company would bring in some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- .
deutsch bahn is europe 's largest rail company and services almost 1.9 billion passengers a year .
it also handles 300 million tons of freight annually .
last year it made some 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- in profits . the cabinet also decided the deutsche bahn would retain control of the track network for the next 15 years . if the flotation goes through , it would be the biggest since the sale of deutsche post stock in 2000 .
but the government 's plan will have to be approved by both houses of the german parliament . hard fight ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn employees held strikes recently for more money but it is by no means certain that the proposed ipo will go ahead amidst protests from local governments , unions and consumer groups .
many fear severe disruptions to services such as occurred in previous privatizations - most notably that of british rail in the 1980 and 90s . contentious issues include the potential canceling of local routes and job losses . " we 're afraid the deutsche bahn will cherry-pick the profitable , long-distance routes between the big cities , " said the head of the german association of cities and towns , gerd landsberg .
" that would also endanger the necessary expansion of jobs in rural areas .
that 's unacceptable . " " the privatization of deutsche bahn threatens to derail the central goal of the rail reform , namely to get more people to use train services , " added german union association board member claus matecki . consumer advocacy groups also fear that privatization could mean price hikes and have called on parliamentarians to reject the proposed flotation . but one union representing rail workers , who have staged strikes recently for better pay , said it welcomed the partial privatization . article based on news reports -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin and hamburg failed to win the group 's support to host summer games . the dosb refused to support any potential bid by hamburg or berlin to host the 2016 or 2020 summer games in the wake of failed bids by berlin for the 2000 and leipzig for the 2012 events .
" we have reached the decision that we view very positively a possible bid for a winter olympics under the umbrella of the city of munich , " dosb president thomas bach said tuesday in frankfurt where the organization 's executive committee is meeting .
the final decision will be made at the dosb congress in december .
the international olympic committee is expected to name the host for the 2018 olympics in 2011 .
munich mayor christian ude welcomed the announcement , saying " a major and important hurdle has been cleared on our way to becoming an olympic city once again . "
the bavarian capital hosted the 1972 summer olympics and would become the first city to host a winter and summer games if it puts together a successful bid .
ude announced that the winter resort of garmisch-partenkirchen , situated in the alps south of munich , would definitely be part of any bid and he also refused to rule out other locations .
munich intended to put together a " compact " bid , he said , citing the canadian city of vancouver , host of the 2010 games , as the role model .
dosb aware of mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb will make sure nothing goes wrong this time " a good bid needs a clear concept and a clear financing structure , " said dosb general director michael vesper , while bach estimated the bid budget at between 25 million and 35 million euros -lrb- $ 34.5 million to $ 48.4 million -rrb- .
" but we should n't restrict ourselves to a bid that simply puts superb sports venues in places , we also need an inspiring idea , " said bach .
they also need things to run smoothly once that idea is in place .
germany 's most recent olympic bids have been mired in controversy - and failure - despite having impressive plans to offer .
the joint leipzig / rostock bid for the 2012 games struggled to even make the voting for the candidate cities in 2004 after being crippled by scandals involving alleged financial irregularities and the bid organizers ' ties to the stasi , the former east german secret police .
stasi rumors and dodgy dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's bid for 2012 went up in flames first were the allegations surrounding dirk thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , concerning his past involvement with the stasi .
thärichen resigned from the post in 2003 .
then harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly-run olympic marketing committee , resigned soon after , dogged by similar stasi speculation and allegations of complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
he was followed through the exit by burkhard jung , the city official who represented leipzig during the city ’ s successful bid to become the german candidate before becoming a supervisory board member of the company overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
he stepped down from his position after allegations he was involved in illegal commission payments worth 150,000 euros made to a marketing company while leipzig was bidding to represent germany .
the heads kept rolling with wolfram köhler , the state secretary for saxony , who resigned after he had come under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa .
berlin hampered by cold war legacy berlin 's efforts to get the 2000 olympic games ended in humiliation , when it came last among the six countries vying for the honor .
the newly unified capital 's bid floundered on its inadequate infrastructure , which had suffered during the divisions of the cold war .
while berlin attempted to catch up with its rival bidders by embarking on ambitious building projects , the city was too far behind the pack to get the olympic nod and the games eventually went to sydney .
now , after hosting a hugely successful world cup in 2006 , germany 's big event credentials have sky-rocketed and the dosb hopes to tap into that and put the disappointment of the past behind it . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin and hamburg failed to win the group 's support to host summer games . the dosb refused to support any potential bid by hamburg or berlin to host the 2016 or 2020 summer games in the wake of failed bids by berlin for the 2000 and leipzig for the 2012 events .
" we have reached the decision that we view very positively a possible bid for a winter olympics under the umbrella of the city of munich , " dosb president thomas bach said tuesday in frankfurt where the organization 's executive committee is meeting .
the final decision will be made at the dosb congress in december .
the international olympic committee is expected to name the host for the 2018 olympics in 2011 .
munich mayor christian ude welcomed the announcement , saying " a major and important hurdle has been cleared on our way to becoming an olympic city once again . "
the bavarian capital hosted the 1972 summer olympics and would become the first city to host a winter and summer games if it puts together a successful bid .
ude announced that the winter resort of garmisch-partenkirchen , situated in the alps south of munich , would definitely be part of any bid and he also refused to rule out other locations .
munich intended to put together a " compact " bid , he said , citing the canadian city of vancouver , host of the 2010 games , as the role model .
dosb aware of mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb will make sure nothing goes wrong this time " a good bid needs a clear concept and a clear financing structure , " said dosb general director michael vesper , while bach estimated the bid budget at between 25 million and 35 million euros -lrb- $ 34.5 million to $ 48.4 million -rrb- .
" but we should n't restrict ourselves to a bid that simply puts superb sports venues in places , we also need an inspiring idea , " said bach .
they also need things to run smoothly once that idea is in place .
germany 's most recent olympic bids have been mired in controversy - and failure - despite having impressive plans to offer .
the joint leipzig / rostock bid for the 2012 games struggled to even make the voting for the candidate cities in 2004 after being crippled by scandals involving alleged financial irregularities and the bid organizers ' ties to the stasi , the former east german secret police .
stasi rumors and dodgy dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's bid for 2012 went up in flames first were the allegations surrounding dirk thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , concerning his past involvement with the stasi .
thärichen resigned from the post in 2003 .
then harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly-run olympic marketing committee , resigned soon after , dogged by similar stasi speculation and allegations of complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
he was followed through the exit by burkhard jung , the city official who represented leipzig during the city ’ s successful bid to become the german candidate before becoming a supervisory board member of the company overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
he stepped down from his position after allegations he was involved in illegal commission payments worth 150,000 euros made to a marketing company while leipzig was bidding to represent germany .
the heads kept rolling with wolfram köhler , the state secretary for saxony , who resigned after he had come under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa .
berlin hampered by cold war legacy berlin 's efforts to get the 2000 olympic games ended in humiliation , when it came last among the six countries vying for the honor .
the newly unified capital 's bid floundered on its inadequate infrastructure , which had suffered during the divisions of the cold war .
while berlin attempted to catch up with its rival bidders by embarking on ambitious building projects , the city was too far behind the pack to get the olympic nod and the games eventually went to sydney .

as german chancellor angela merkel prepares to meet un representative to afghanistan tom koenigs on tuesday to discuss the situation , the debate over the future of german forces engaged in missions as part of the wider , us-led " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- rages behind the scenes .
merkel 's government has rejected all calls for its armed forces to be pulled out of afghanistan but those who are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition , such as the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens , are unlikely to be brushed off so easily .
the spd , the other party in merkel 's grand coalition government , are vociferously against the bundeswehr being involved in any us-controlled anti-terror operation , and the greens continue to hold their previous stance of rejecting out-right the mandate that sent german troops overseas as part of oef .
meanwhile , the left-wing alliance left party has called for an immediate removal of the armed forces .
public opinion is also being affected by the reports of increasing danger to germans overseas .
a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
at the moment , the government refuses to budge saying that the increased targeting of german personnel in afghanistan , both military and civilian , is a tactic employed by the taliban to provoke a debate over a withdrawal .
merkel and government staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the recent german casualties , merkel said german troops will stay in afghanistan merkel herself has said that the government will not respond to blackmail and that german troops were in afghanistan as a matter of international and domestic security .
" we are there because german security is also being protected over there , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" it is our concept to combine military issues with reconstruction . "
with the bundestag to decide on the extension of the bundeswehr 's mandate in afghanistan in the fall , some security experts , most notably the bundeswehr 's chief of staff wolfgang schneiderhan , have warned that the taliban is likely to increase its pressure in a bid to influence the outcome of the coming parliamentary debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs could not say if germans were specific targets however , speaking ahead of his meeting with merkel , un representative koenigs could not say whether there was a concerted effort to influence the debate by specifically targeting germans in afghanistan or if the current activity towards them will continue .
" the uprising is directed against the government as well as against the international community which it supports , " koenigs told german public broadcaster ndr .
" but i do not see a general hostility towards foreigners yet .
of course , those softer targets and those least defended , such as foreign tourists and workers , are in the most danger and this is certainly a problem . "
koenigs did , however , admit that the taliban was acutely aware of the power of its actions in the wider political domain .
" the taliban are of course very well versed in the media , " he added .
" and every reaction by a perceived enemy state is regarded as a victory and of course used as such .
these taliban forces are very engaged politically . "
koenigs in favor of extended german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs supports the bundeswehr 's mission the un representative also said he was in favor of keeping german troops in afghanistan and dismissed talk of " iraqization " - the concerted targeting of foreign nationals as kidnap victims and high-profile , ideologically motivated kills - in afghanistan .
he called on germany to extend its mandate when the time came , both military as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and as part of the reconstruction efforts .
" we have done the right thing , " koenigs said .
" we should stay the course , even if there is danger , even if we have some difficult times ahead .
despite the dangers and difficulties , we are also welcomed in afghanistan .
" i found the decision of the german society for technical collaboration -lrb- gtz -rrb- to continue with reconstruction efforts in the south to be particularly helpful , " he continued .

merkel 's government has rejected all calls for its armed forces to be pulled out of afghanistan but those who are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition , such as the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens , are unlikely to be brushed off so easily .
the spd , the other party in merkel 's grand coalition government , are vociferously against the bundeswehr being involved in any us-controlled anti-terror operation , and the greens continue to hold their previous stance of rejecting out-right the mandate that sent german troops overseas as part of oef .
meanwhile , the left-wing alliance left party has called for an immediate removal of the armed forces .
public opinion is also being affected by the reports of increasing danger to germans overseas .
a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
at the moment , the government refuses to budge saying that the increased targeting of german personnel in afghanistan , both military and civilian , is a tactic employed by the taliban to provoke a debate over a withdrawal .
merkel and government staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the recent german casualties , merkel said german troops will stay in afghanistan merkel herself has said that the government will not respond to blackmail and that german troops were in afghanistan as a matter of international and domestic security .
" we are there because german security is also being protected over there , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" it is our concept to combine military issues with reconstruction . "
with the bundestag to decide on the extension of the bundeswehr 's mandate in afghanistan in the fall , some security experts , most notably the bundeswehr 's chief of staff wolfgang schneiderhan , have warned that the taliban is likely to increase its pressure in a bid to influence the outcome of the coming parliamentary debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs could not say if germans were specific targets however , speaking ahead of his meeting with merkel , un representative koenigs could not say whether there was a concerted effort to influence the debate by specifically targeting germans in afghanistan or if the current activity towards them will continue .
" the uprising is directed against the government as well as against the international community which it supports , " koenigs told german public broadcaster ndr .
" but i do not see a general hostility towards foreigners yet .
of course , those softer targets and those least defended , such as foreign tourists and workers , are in the most danger and this is certainly a problem . "
koenigs did , however , admit that the taliban was acutely aware of the power of its actions in the wider political domain .
" the taliban are of course very well versed in the media , " he added .
" and every reaction by a perceived enemy state is regarded as a victory and of course used as such .
these taliban forces are very engaged politically . "
koenigs in favor of extended german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs supports the bundeswehr 's mission the un representative also said he was in favor of keeping german troops in afghanistan and dismissed talk of " iraqization " - the concerted targeting of foreign nationals as kidnap victims and high-profile , ideologically motivated kills - in afghanistan .
he called on germany to extend its mandate when the time came , both military as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and as part of the reconstruction efforts .
" we have done the right thing , " koenigs said .
" we should stay the course , even if there is danger , even if we have some difficult times ahead .
despite the dangers and difficulties , we are also welcomed in afghanistan .
" i found the decision of the german society for technical collaboration -lrb- gtz -rrb- to continue with reconstruction efforts in the south to be particularly helpful , " he continued .
" applying german technical know-how leads to a certain stabilization and , above all , it shows the people that it is worthwhile to cooperate with the international community .

a statement by portugal , as current eu president , praised libya for its " constructive attitude " and noted " the potential of increased eu-libya cooperation in many areas of common interest . "
the eu was committed to working on the framework of future eu-libya relations , the statement added .
european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters he wanted a " further normalization " of relations with libya but gave no indication of what this would involve .
officials said further work on building better ties with libya would be done by eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who played a key role in securing the release of the medics , five nurses and a doctor .
" this decision will open the way for a new and enhanced relationship between the eu and libya , " said ferrero-waldner , adding ties would also be reinforced with north african states .

" this news will ... assist in the normalization of relations and open the possibility for closer cooperation through the euro-mediterranean partnership , " watson said .
he warned , however , that libya still had to demonstrate that it could be a reliable partner in the long term .
relations between the eu and libya have improved in recent years , but the country is not a member of the bloc 's 11-year-old euro-mediterranean -lrb- euro-med -rrb- partnership which covers all other north african countries .
eu diplomats have long argued that libya does not meet the human rights and democracy standards required to join the euro-med relationship .
but the country has been given observer status when attending euro-med meetings .
libya is also not included in the eu 's so-called " neighborhood policy " under which states on the bloc 's southern and eastern borders receive financial aid for political and economic reform .
change after un sanctions lifted eu relations with libya began to improve slowly following the lifting of un sanctions against tripoli in september 2003 , and libyan leader moammar gadhafi visited eu institutions in april 2004 .
in october of that year , eu governments repealed so-called " restrictive measures " against libya adopted as part of the un framework and also lifted an arms embargo against the country introduced in 1986 .

the state will retain majority control , but fears are rife that local service , in particular , will suffer . the cabinet decision envisions the government selling off a quarter of deutsche bahn shares by the beginning of 2009 .
another 24 percent could also be sold - according to the german constitution , the state is obliged to retain a majority holding as part of its duty to provide germany with rail services . " with this decision , we 've taken a huge step toward implementing the government 's rail reform program , " said german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in berlin on tuesday . the government estimates that selling a 25 percent stake in the german rail company would bring in some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- .
deutsch bahn is europe 's largest rail company and services almost 1.9 billion passengers a year .
it also handles 300 million tons of freight annually .
last year it made some 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- in profits . the cabinet also decided the deutsche bahn would retain control of the track network for the next 15 years . if the flotation goes through , it would be the biggest since the sale of deutsche post stock in 2000 .
but the government 's plan will have to be approved by both houses of the german parliament . hard fight ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn employees held strikes recently for more money but it is by no means certain that the proposed ipo will go ahead amidst protests from local governments , unions and consumer groups .
many fear severe disruptions to services such as occurred in previous privatizations - most notably that of british rail in the 1980 and 90s . contentious issues include the potential canceling of local routes and job losses . " we 're afraid the deutsche bahn will cherry-pick the profitable , long-distance routes between the big cities , " said the head of the german association of cities and towns , gerd landsberg .
" that would also endanger the necessary expansion of jobs in rural areas .
that 's unacceptable . " " the privatization of deutsche bahn threatens to derail the central goal of the rail reform , namely to get more people to use train services , " added german union association board member claus matecki . consumer advocacy groups also fear that privatization could mean price hikes and have called on parliamentarians to reject the proposed flotation . but one union representing rail workers , who have staged strikes recently for better pay , said it welcomed the partial privatization . article based on news reports -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with the most likely candidate , richard wagner 's great-granddaughter katharina . ever since wolfgang wagner , director of the bayreuth festival and the composer 's grandson , announced in 1999 that the search for a worthy successor was underway , festival fans and classical music connoisseurs have been hotly speculating on the lucky heir .
the 88-year-old impresario 's daughter katharina , 29 , now seems to have emerged as a favorite for the job , stepping ahead of her older sister eva and cousin nike , both twice her age .
katharina wagner will make her bayreuth festival directing debut on july 25 , the opening night , with her staging of richard wagner 's " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .
you grew up and learned there in the house .
what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .
ultimately , new impulses from the outside come in - the nuremberg system ca n't exist any more as it did and nuremberg changes at the end of the second act .
innovation collides with tradition , which for me is the most exiting issues in the opera , that these master singers are really a big art class .
and that 's one of the biggest questions : what 's the relationship between innovation and tradition , and art - or the artist - and society ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wait for years to get tickets in reference to you becoming the next festival director , your father has said , " if she can , then she should . "
how do you see this statement ?
that 's typical of my father .
whoever knows my father will know that that 's original wolfgang wagner .
although he said , " if she can and wants to . "
which conditions have to be met for you to accept the position ?
it does n't only depend on me .
it mostly depends on other people .
at the moment , my father is both manager and director in one and this constellation will change .
there will be four managers .
these four people have high expectations for a festival director , which i do n't know if i can fulfill .
it 's also a matter that needs to be discussed - what do the managers expect , what do i expect from them .
these things just all have to fit .
what 's the most important condition for you ?
that the artistic quality remains .

the 88-year-old impresario 's daughter katharina , 29 , now seems to have emerged as a favorite for the job , stepping ahead of her older sister eva and cousin nike , both twice her age .
katharina wagner will make her bayreuth festival directing debut on july 25 , the opening night , with her staging of richard wagner 's " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .
you grew up and learned there in the house .
what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .
ultimately , new impulses from the outside come in - the nuremberg system ca n't exist any more as it did and nuremberg changes at the end of the second act .
innovation collides with tradition , which for me is the most exiting issues in the opera , that these master singers are really a big art class .
and that 's one of the biggest questions : what 's the relationship between innovation and tradition , and art - or the artist - and society ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wait for years to get tickets in reference to you becoming the next festival director , your father has said , " if she can , then she should . "
how do you see this statement ?
that 's typical of my father .
whoever knows my father will know that that 's original wolfgang wagner .
although he said , " if she can and wants to . "
which conditions have to be met for you to accept the position ?
it does n't only depend on me .
it mostly depends on other people .
at the moment , my father is both manager and director in one and this constellation will change .
there will be four managers .
these four people have high expectations for a festival director , which i do n't know if i can fulfill .
it 's also a matter that needs to be discussed - what do the managers expect , what do i expect from them .
these things just all have to fit .
what 's the most important condition for you ?
that the artistic quality remains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.07.2007 eu plans upgraded ties with libya after medics ' release großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking up for realtions between the eu and gadhafi 's libya the european union on tuesday promised to upgrade political and economic ties with libya after authorities in tripoli released six bulgarian medics who had been sentenced to life in prison there . details of just how - and how fast - the so-far stagnant eu-libyan relationship will be improved were still being considered , officials said .
a statement by portugal , as current eu president , praised libya for its " constructive attitude " and noted " the potential of increased eu-libya cooperation in many areas of common interest . "
the eu was committed to working on the framework of future eu-libya relations , the statement added .
european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters he wanted a " further normalization " of relations with libya but gave no indication of what this would involve .
officials said further work on building better ties with libya would be done by eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who played a key role in securing the release of the medics , five nurses and a doctor .
" this decision will open the way for a new and enhanced relationship between the eu and libya , " said ferrero-waldner , adding ties would also be reinforced with north african states .
but is libya reliable ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner played a large role in the medics release graham watson , the leader of the european parliament 's liberal group , said libya 's decision to free the medics meant the country would not return to international isolation .
" this news will ... assist in the normalization of relations and open the possibility for closer cooperation through the euro-mediterranean partnership , " watson said .
he warned , however , that libya still had to demonstrate that it could be a reliable partner in the long term .
relations between the eu and libya have improved in recent years , but the country is not a member of the bloc 's 11-year-old euro-mediterranean -lrb- euro-med -rrb- partnership which covers all other north african countries .
eu diplomats have long argued that libya does not meet the human rights and democracy standards required to join the euro-med relationship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : behind the scenes at the bayreuth festival katarina wagner 's bayreuth debut elicits boos and bravos alike wagners want to keep bayreuth festival in the family going backstage with bayreuth festival singers classical music -pipe- 24.07.2007 " i stay out of all the wagner family disputes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner directed the " meistersinger " for this year 's bayreuth festival who will be the next to take the throne at the world-famous wagner festival in bayreuth , which starts wedensday ?
dw spoke with the most likely candidate , richard wagner 's great-granddaughter katharina . ever since wolfgang wagner , director of the bayreuth festival and the composer 's grandson , announced in 1999 that the search for a worthy successor was underway , festival fans and classical music connoisseurs have been hotly speculating on the lucky heir .
the 88-year-old impresario 's daughter katharina , 29 , now seems to have emerged as a favorite for the job , stepping ahead of her older sister eva and cousin nike , both twice her age .
katharina wagner will make her bayreuth festival directing debut on july 25 , the opening night , with her staging of richard wagner 's " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .
you grew up and learned there in the house .
what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .

dw spoke with the most likely candidate , richard wagner 's great-granddaughter katharina . ever since wolfgang wagner , director of the bayreuth festival and the composer 's grandson , announced in 1999 that the search for a worthy successor was underway , festival fans and classical music connoisseurs have been hotly speculating on the lucky heir .
the 88-year-old impresario 's daughter katharina , 29 , now seems to have emerged as a favorite for the job , stepping ahead of her older sister eva and cousin nike , both twice her age .
katharina wagner will make her bayreuth festival directing debut on july 25 , the opening night , with her staging of richard wagner 's " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .
you grew up and learned there in the house .
what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .
ultimately , new impulses from the outside come in - the nuremberg system ca n't exist any more as it did and nuremberg changes at the end of the second act .
innovation collides with tradition , which for me is the most exiting issues in the opera , that these master singers are really a big art class .

as german chancellor angela merkel prepares to meet un representative to afghanistan tom koenigs on tuesday to discuss the situation , the debate over the future of german forces engaged in missions as part of the wider , us-led " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- rages behind the scenes .
merkel 's government has rejected all calls for its armed forces to be pulled out of afghanistan but those who are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition , such as the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens , are unlikely to be brushed off so easily .
the spd , the other party in merkel 's grand coalition government , are vociferously against the bundeswehr being involved in any us-controlled anti-terror operation , and the greens continue to hold their previous stance of rejecting out-right the mandate that sent german troops overseas as part of oef .
meanwhile , the left-wing alliance left party has called for an immediate removal of the armed forces .
public opinion is also being affected by the reports of increasing danger to germans overseas .
a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
at the moment , the government refuses to budge saying that the increased targeting of german personnel in afghanistan , both military and civilian , is a tactic employed by the taliban to provoke a debate over a withdrawal .
merkel and government staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the recent german casualties , merkel said german troops will stay in afghanistan merkel herself has said that the government will not respond to blackmail and that german troops were in afghanistan as a matter of international and domestic security .
" we are there because german security is also being protected over there , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" it is our concept to combine military issues with reconstruction . "
with the bundestag to decide on the extension of the bundeswehr 's mandate in afghanistan in the fall , some security experts , most notably the bundeswehr 's chief of staff wolfgang schneiderhan , have warned that the taliban is likely to increase its pressure in a bid to influence the outcome of the coming parliamentary debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs could not say if germans were specific targets however , speaking ahead of his meeting with merkel , un representative koenigs could not say whether there was a concerted effort to influence the debate by specifically targeting germans in afghanistan or if the current activity towards them will continue .
" the uprising is directed against the government as well as against the international community which it supports , " koenigs told german public broadcaster ndr .
" but i do not see a general hostility towards foreigners yet .
of course , those softer targets and those least defended , such as foreign tourists and workers , are in the most danger and this is certainly a problem . "
koenigs did , however , admit that the taliban was acutely aware of the power of its actions in the wider political domain .
" the taliban are of course very well versed in the media , " he added .
" and every reaction by a perceived enemy state is regarded as a victory and of course used as such .
these taliban forces are very engaged politically . "
koenigs in favor of extended german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs supports the bundeswehr 's mission the un representative also said he was in favor of keeping german troops in afghanistan and dismissed talk of " iraqization " - the concerted targeting of foreign nationals as kidnap victims and high-profile , ideologically motivated kills - in afghanistan .
he called on germany to extend its mandate when the time came , both military as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and as part of the reconstruction efforts .
" we have done the right thing , " koenigs said .
" we should stay the course , even if there is danger , even if we have some difficult times ahead .
despite the dangers and difficulties , we are also welcomed in afghanistan .
" i found the decision of the german society for technical collaboration -lrb- gtz -rrb- to continue with reconstruction efforts in the south to be particularly helpful , " he continued .

berlin has promised to maintain its efforts in the region . nations actively involved in rebuilding afghanistan need to stick to their promises , koenigs said after talks with german chancellor angela merkel on tuesday in berlin .
" afghanistan is a long-term commitment and the afghans expect us to live up to our obligations , " he said , describing the current situation as " extremely difficult . "
an increase in violence by remnants of the ousted taliban regime has seen a spate of attacks on nato-led peacekeepers as well as suicide bombings and kidnappings of foreigners .
un envoy calls for democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and tom koenigs address the press koenigs said the international community was determined to press ahead with the democratization process in afghanistan by " robust " means if necessary , including the use of military force .
he also said it was vital to check taliban resurgence in the south of the country under the mandate provided to the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
" we will need additional support in the near future because the threat is not yet over , " said koenigs , a german diplomat who is the special representative of un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
merkel : germany stands firm merkel pledged that germany would maintain its commitment to afghanistan , where taliban rebels are holding a german engineer hostage after another german died in their hands this week .

as german chancellor angela merkel prepares to meet un representative to afghanistan tom koenigs on tuesday to discuss the situation , the debate over the future of german forces engaged in missions as part of the wider , us-led " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- rages behind the scenes .
merkel 's government has rejected all calls for its armed forces to be pulled out of afghanistan but those who are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition , such as the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens , are unlikely to be brushed off so easily .
the spd , the other party in merkel 's grand coalition government , are vociferously against the bundeswehr being involved in any us-controlled anti-terror operation , and the greens continue to hold their previous stance of rejecting out-right the mandate that sent german troops overseas as part of oef .
meanwhile , the left-wing alliance left party has called for an immediate removal of the armed forces .
public opinion is also being affected by the reports of increasing danger to germans overseas .
a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
at the moment , the government refuses to budge saying that the increased targeting of german personnel in afghanistan , both military and civilian , is a tactic employed by the taliban to provoke a debate over a withdrawal .
merkel and government staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the recent german casualties , merkel said german troops will stay in afghanistan merkel herself has said that the government will not respond to blackmail and that german troops were in afghanistan as a matter of international and domestic security .
" we are there because german security is also being protected over there , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" it is our concept to combine military issues with reconstruction . "
with the bundestag to decide on the extension of the bundeswehr 's mandate in afghanistan in the fall , some security experts , most notably the bundeswehr 's chief of staff wolfgang schneiderhan , have warned that the taliban is likely to increase its pressure in a bid to influence the outcome of the coming parliamentary debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs could not say if germans were specific targets however , speaking ahead of his meeting with merkel , un representative koenigs could not say whether there was a concerted effort to influence the debate by specifically targeting germans in afghanistan or if the current activity towards them will continue .
" the uprising is directed against the government as well as against the international community which it supports , " koenigs told german public broadcaster ndr .
" but i do not see a general hostility towards foreigners yet .
of course , those softer targets and those least defended , such as foreign tourists and workers , are in the most danger and this is certainly a problem . "
koenigs did , however , admit that the taliban was acutely aware of the power of its actions in the wider political domain .
" the taliban are of course very well versed in the media , " he added .
" and every reaction by a perceived enemy state is regarded as a victory and of course used as such .
these taliban forces are very engaged politically . "
koenigs in favor of extended german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs supports the bundeswehr 's mission the un representative also said he was in favor of keeping german troops in afghanistan and dismissed talk of " iraqization " - the concerted targeting of foreign nationals as kidnap victims and high-profile , ideologically motivated kills - in afghanistan .
he called on germany to extend its mandate when the time came , both military as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and as part of the reconstruction efforts .
" we have done the right thing , " koenigs said .
" we should stay the course , even if there is danger , even if we have some difficult times ahead .
despite the dangers and difficulties , we are also welcomed in afghanistan .

the eu " stands ready to play an active role " in an international middle east peace conference in autumn proposed by the united states and backed by middle east mediators last week , eu foreign ministers said in a statement on monday after a meeting in brussels .
eu top diplomat javier solana said that the idea of such a conference had always been in the mind of the eu and that the bloc was " completely in favor of it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters that the meeting would be an opportunity to draw conclusions " on how we can move ahead on the way to a two-state solution . "
while eu foreign chiefs welcomed israel 's recent move to release 255 palestinian prisoners and the partial transfer of palestinian tax and custom revenues , they called for " the immediate , complete and regular release of the remaining and future funds . "
the eu-27 also urged israel " to take further steps to meet the commitments " towards the palestinians , including a removal of checkpoints and barriers in the west bank .
full support for abbas ministers confirmed the eu 's " full support " for palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
like the us , the eu has pledged to improve the clout and standing of abbas and his moderate fatah movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas -lrb- left -rrb- and israeli prime minister ehud olmert " reconciliation and national unity behind the program of peace articulated by president abbas are the only way to achieve palestinian national goals by peaceful , lawful and democratic means , " ministers said .
" the eu opposes any division of the palestinian territories and confirms its readiness to engage with all palestinian parties whose policy and actions reflect the -lsb- middle east -rsb- quartet principles , " they said .
members of the quartet last week said they would not talk to hamas , repeating that the militant group - which has seized control of the gaza strip from abbas ' forces - must first recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce terrorism and sign up to past agreements with israel .
funds still unreleased eu ministers said that the bloc was committed " to help build the institutions and economy of the future palestinian state . "
unlike washington , the eu has yet to release millions of dollars in direct aid to the fatah-led palestinian government .
the funds were frozen after last year 's hamas electoral victory .
the militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the us .
the eu has , however , been channeling aid for the palestinian health and security sector through non-governmental aid groups .

as german chancellor angela merkel prepares to meet un representative to afghanistan tom koenigs on tuesday to discuss the situation , the debate over the future of german forces engaged in missions as part of the wider , us-led " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- rages behind the scenes .
merkel 's government has rejected all calls for its armed forces to be pulled out of afghanistan but those who are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition , such as the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens , are unlikely to be brushed off so easily .
the spd , the other party in merkel 's grand coalition government , are vociferously against the bundeswehr being involved in any us-controlled anti-terror operation , and the greens continue to hold their previous stance of rejecting out-right the mandate that sent german troops overseas as part of oef .
meanwhile , the left-wing alliance left party has called for an immediate removal of the armed forces .
public opinion is also being affected by the reports of increasing danger to germans overseas .
a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
at the moment , the government refuses to budge saying that the increased targeting of german personnel in afghanistan , both military and civilian , is a tactic employed by the taliban to provoke a debate over a withdrawal .
merkel and government staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the recent german casualties , merkel said german troops will stay in afghanistan merkel herself has said that the government will not respond to blackmail and that german troops were in afghanistan as a matter of international and domestic security .
" we are there because german security is also being protected over there , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" it is our concept to combine military issues with reconstruction . "
with the bundestag to decide on the extension of the bundeswehr 's mandate in afghanistan in the fall , some security experts , most notably the bundeswehr 's chief of staff wolfgang schneiderhan , have warned that the taliban is likely to increase its pressure in a bid to influence the outcome of the coming parliamentary debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs could not say if germans were specific targets however , speaking ahead of his meeting with merkel , un representative koenigs could not say whether there was a concerted effort to influence the debate by specifically targeting germans in afghanistan or if the current activity towards them will continue .
" the uprising is directed against the government as well as against the international community which it supports , " koenigs told german public broadcaster ndr .
" but i do not see a general hostility towards foreigners yet .
of course , those softer targets and those least defended , such as foreign tourists and workers , are in the most danger and this is certainly a problem . "
koenigs did , however , admit that the taliban was acutely aware of the power of its actions in the wider political domain .
" the taliban are of course very well versed in the media , " he added .
" and every reaction by a perceived enemy state is regarded as a victory and of course used as such .
these taliban forces are very engaged politically . "
koenigs in favor of extended german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs supports the bundeswehr 's mission the un representative also said he was in favor of keeping german troops in afghanistan and dismissed talk of " iraqization " - the concerted targeting of foreign nationals as kidnap victims and high-profile , ideologically motivated kills - in afghanistan .
he called on germany to extend its mandate when the time came , both military as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and as part of the reconstruction efforts .
" we have done the right thing , " koenigs said .
" we should stay the course , even if there is danger , even if we have some difficult times ahead .
despite the dangers and difficulties , we are also welcomed in afghanistan .
" i found the decision of the german society for technical collaboration -lrb- gtz -rrb- to continue with reconstruction efforts in the south to be particularly helpful , " he continued .

the state will retain majority control , but fears are rife that local service , in particular , will suffer . the cabinet decision envisions the government selling off a quarter of deutsche bahn shares by the beginning of 2009 .
another 24 percent could also be sold - according to the german constitution , the state is obliged to retain a majority holding as part of its duty to provide germany with rail services . " with this decision , we 've taken a huge step toward implementing the government 's rail reform program , " said german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in berlin on tuesday . the government estimates that selling a 25 percent stake in the german rail company would bring in some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- .
deutsch bahn is europe 's largest rail company and services almost 1.9 billion passengers a year .
it also handles 300 million tons of freight annually .
last year it made some 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- in profits . the cabinet also decided the deutsche bahn would retain control of the track network for the next 15 years . if the flotation goes through , it would be the biggest since the sale of deutsche post stock in 2000 .
but the government 's plan will have to be approved by both houses of the german parliament . hard fight ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn employees held strikes recently for more money but it is by no means certain that the proposed ipo will go ahead amidst protests from local governments , unions and consumer groups .
many fear severe disruptions to services such as occurred in previous privatizations - most notably that of british rail in the 1980 and 90s . contentious issues include the potential canceling of local routes and job losses . " we 're afraid the deutsche bahn will cherry-pick the profitable , long-distance routes between the big cities , " said the head of the german association of cities and towns , gerd landsberg .
" that would also endanger the necessary expansion of jobs in rural areas .
that 's unacceptable . " " the privatization of deutsche bahn threatens to derail the central goal of the rail reform , namely to get more people to use train services , " added german union association board member claus matecki . consumer advocacy groups also fear that privatization could mean price hikes and have called on parliamentarians to reject the proposed flotation . but one union representing rail workers , who have staged strikes recently for better pay , said it welcomed the partial privatization . article based on news reports -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as german chancellor angela merkel prepares to meet un representative to afghanistan tom koenigs on tuesday to discuss the situation , the debate over the future of german forces engaged in missions as part of the wider , us-led " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- rages behind the scenes .
merkel 's government has rejected all calls for its armed forces to be pulled out of afghanistan but those who are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition , such as the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens , are unlikely to be brushed off so easily .
the spd , the other party in merkel 's grand coalition government , are vociferously against the bundeswehr being involved in any us-controlled anti-terror operation , and the greens continue to hold their previous stance of rejecting out-right the mandate that sent german troops overseas as part of oef .
meanwhile , the left-wing alliance left party has called for an immediate removal of the armed forces .
public opinion is also being affected by the reports of increasing danger to germans overseas .
a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
at the moment , the government refuses to budge saying that the increased targeting of german personnel in afghanistan , both military and civilian , is a tactic employed by the taliban to provoke a debate over a withdrawal .
merkel and government staying the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the recent german casualties , merkel said german troops will stay in afghanistan merkel herself has said that the government will not respond to blackmail and that german troops were in afghanistan as a matter of international and domestic security .
" we are there because german security is also being protected over there , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" it is our concept to combine military issues with reconstruction . "
with the bundestag to decide on the extension of the bundeswehr 's mandate in afghanistan in the fall , some security experts , most notably the bundeswehr 's chief of staff wolfgang schneiderhan , have warned that the taliban is likely to increase its pressure in a bid to influence the outcome of the coming parliamentary debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs could not say if germans were specific targets however , speaking ahead of his meeting with merkel , un representative koenigs could not say whether there was a concerted effort to influence the debate by specifically targeting germans in afghanistan or if the current activity towards them will continue .
" the uprising is directed against the government as well as against the international community which it supports , " koenigs told german public broadcaster ndr .
" but i do not see a general hostility towards foreigners yet .
of course , those softer targets and those least defended , such as foreign tourists and workers , are in the most danger and this is certainly a problem . "
koenigs did , however , admit that the taliban was acutely aware of the power of its actions in the wider political domain .
" the taliban are of course very well versed in the media , " he added .
" and every reaction by a perceived enemy state is regarded as a victory and of course used as such .
these taliban forces are very engaged politically . "
koenigs in favor of extended german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigs supports the bundeswehr 's mission the un representative also said he was in favor of keeping german troops in afghanistan and dismissed talk of " iraqization " - the concerted targeting of foreign nationals as kidnap victims and high-profile , ideologically motivated kills - in afghanistan .
he called on germany to extend its mandate when the time came , both military as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and as part of the reconstruction efforts .
" we have done the right thing , " koenigs said .
" we should stay the course , even if there is danger , even if we have some difficult times ahead .
despite the dangers and difficulties , we are also welcomed in afghanistan .
" i found the decision of the german society for technical collaboration -lrb- gtz -rrb- to continue with reconstruction efforts in the south to be particularly helpful , " he continued .
" applying german technical know-how leads to a certain stabilization and , above all , it shows the people that it is worthwhile to cooperate with the international community .

berlin and hamburg failed to win the group 's support to host summer games . the dosb refused to support any potential bid by hamburg or berlin to host the 2016 or 2020 summer games in the wake of failed bids by berlin for the 2000 and leipzig for the 2012 events .
" we have reached the decision that we view very positively a possible bid for a winter olympics under the umbrella of the city of munich , " dosb president thomas bach said tuesday in frankfurt where the organization 's executive committee is meeting .
the final decision will be made at the dosb congress in december .
the international olympic committee is expected to name the host for the 2018 olympics in 2011 .
munich mayor christian ude welcomed the announcement , saying " a major and important hurdle has been cleared on our way to becoming an olympic city once again . "
the bavarian capital hosted the 1972 summer olympics and would become the first city to host a winter and summer games if it puts together a successful bid .
ude announced that the winter resort of garmisch-partenkirchen , situated in the alps south of munich , would definitely be part of any bid and he also refused to rule out other locations .
munich intended to put together a " compact " bid , he said , citing the canadian city of vancouver , host of the 2010 games , as the role model .
dosb aware of mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb will make sure nothing goes wrong this time " a good bid needs a clear concept and a clear financing structure , " said dosb general director michael vesper , while bach estimated the bid budget at between 25 million and 35 million euros -lrb- $ 34.5 million to $ 48.4 million -rrb- .
" but we should n't restrict ourselves to a bid that simply puts superb sports venues in places , we also need an inspiring idea , " said bach .
they also need things to run smoothly once that idea is in place .
germany 's most recent olympic bids have been mired in controversy - and failure - despite having impressive plans to offer .
the joint leipzig / rostock bid for the 2012 games struggled to even make the voting for the candidate cities in 2004 after being crippled by scandals involving alleged financial irregularities and the bid organizers ' ties to the stasi , the former east german secret police .
stasi rumors and dodgy dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's bid for 2012 went up in flames first were the allegations surrounding dirk thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , concerning his past involvement with the stasi .
thärichen resigned from the post in 2003 .
then harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly-run olympic marketing committee , resigned soon after , dogged by similar stasi speculation and allegations of complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
he was followed through the exit by burkhard jung , the city official who represented leipzig during the city ’ s successful bid to become the german candidate before becoming a supervisory board member of the company overseeing leipzig ’ s bid .
he stepped down from his position after allegations he was involved in illegal commission payments worth 150,000 euros made to a marketing company while leipzig was bidding to represent germany .
the heads kept rolling with wolfram köhler , the state secretary for saxony , who resigned after he had come under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa .
berlin hampered by cold war legacy berlin 's efforts to get the 2000 olympic games ended in humiliation , when it came last among the six countries vying for the honor .
the newly unified capital 's bid floundered on its inadequate infrastructure , which had suffered during the divisions of the cold war .
while berlin attempted to catch up with its rival bidders by embarking on ambitious building projects , the city was too far behind the pack to get the olympic nod and the games eventually went to sydney .

" one can hardly say that it 's the result of a change of trend , " political scientist dieter oberndörfer of the university of freiburg told german news agency dpa .
slightly over a million people have assumed german nationality since the country 's new citizenship law came into effect in 2000 .
the numbers dropped steadily in subsequent years , with only 117,241 foreigners naturalized in 2005 .
turks made up the greatest number of new germans in 2006 , as in previous years , with around 33,500 changing their nationality .
around 12,600 former serbian and montenegrin nationals were in second place , 6,940 poles in third , and 4,690 people from russia in fourth .
they were followed by around 4,550 ukrainians , 4,310 israelis , 3,690 iraqis and 3,550 moroccans .
over 50 percent more israelis and 43 percent more people from serbia and montenegro became german in 2006 than in 2005 .
motivated by outside factors experts expect that the number of turkish applicants will fall as turkey intensifies its ties to the european union .
as turkey has associate membership status with the eu , there are few areas in which turkish nationals experience disadvantages in relation to eu nations , oberndörfer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows dual allegiance , but not dual citizenship people do n't appear to have been mainly attracted to assume the country 's citizenship by the desire to become german .
on the contrary , oberndörfer said most applicants were motivated to become german by outside factors such as the political situation in their countries of origin .
he said the increase in the numbers of israelis and people from serbia and montenegro who were naturalized had to do with the " growing insecurity in israel and a situation without perspectives in serbia . "
foreigners can apply to be naturalized as germans after eight years as legal immigrants , but germany does not grant them citizenship unless they legally abandon their old nationality . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one can hardly say that it 's the result of a change of trend , " political scientist dieter oberndörfer of the university of freiburg told german news agency dpa .
slightly over a million people have assumed german nationality since the country 's new citizenship law came into effect in 2000 .
the numbers dropped steadily in subsequent years , with only 117,241 foreigners naturalized in 2005 .
turks made up the greatest number of new germans in 2006 , as in previous years , with around 33,500 changing their nationality .
around 12,600 former serbian and montenegrin nationals were in second place , 6,940 poles in third , and 4,690 people from russia in fourth .
they were followed by around 4,550 ukrainians , 4,310 israelis , 3,690 iraqis and 3,550 moroccans .
over 50 percent more israelis and 43 percent more people from serbia and montenegro became german in 2006 than in 2005 .
motivated by outside factors experts expect that the number of turkish applicants will fall as turkey intensifies its ties to the european union .

on the contrary , oberndörfer said most applicants were motivated to become german by outside factors such as the political situation in their countries of origin .
he said the increase in the numbers of israelis and people from serbia and montenegro who were naturalized had to do with the " growing insecurity in israel and a situation without perspectives in serbia . "

he said the increase in the numbers of israelis and people from serbia and montenegro who were naturalized had to do with the " growing insecurity in israel and a situation without perspectives in serbia . "

dw spoke with the most likely candidate , richard wagner 's great-granddaughter katharina . ever since wolfgang wagner , director of the bayreuth festival and the composer 's grandson , announced in 1999 that the search for a worthy successor was underway , festival fans and classical music connoisseurs have been hotly speculating on the lucky heir .

katharina wagner will make her bayreuth festival directing debut on july 25 , the opening night , with her staging of richard wagner 's " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .
you grew up and learned there in the house .
what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .
ultimately , new impulses from the outside come in - the nuremberg system ca n't exist any more as it did and nuremberg changes at the end of the second act .
innovation collides with tradition , which for me is the most exiting issues in the opera , that these master singers are really a big art class .
and that 's one of the biggest questions : what 's the relationship between innovation and tradition , and art - or the artist - and society ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wait for years to get tickets in reference to you becoming the next festival director , your father has said , " if she can , then she should . "
how do you see this statement ?
that 's typical of my father .
whoever knows my father will know that that 's original wolfgang wagner .
although he said , " if she can and wants to . "
which conditions have to be met for you to accept the position ?
it does n't only depend on me .
it mostly depends on other people .
at the moment , my father is both manager and director in one and this constellation will change .
there will be four managers .
these four people have high expectations for a festival director , which i do n't know if i can fulfill .
it 's also a matter that needs to be discussed - what do the managers expect , what do i expect from them .
these things just all have to fit .
what 's the most important condition for you ?
that the artistic quality remains .

none of the other gas-station customers were particularly concerned - apparently , it was n't the woman 's first such outing . " i know the woman from last summer , when she did the same thing , " said the station attendant .
" it 's a bit strange serving her , but she 's very nice .

dw spoke with the most likely candidate , richard wagner 's great-granddaughter katharina . ever since wolfgang wagner , director of the bayreuth festival and the composer 's grandson , announced in 1999 that the search for a worthy successor was underway , festival fans and classical music connoisseurs have been hotly speculating on the lucky heir .
the 88-year-old impresario 's daughter katharina , 29 , now seems to have emerged as a favorite for the job , stepping ahead of her older sister eva and cousin nike , both twice her age .
katharina wagner will make her bayreuth festival directing debut on july 25 , the opening night , with her staging of richard wagner 's " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner founded the festival in 1876 dw : the press tends to write about the wagners as a kind of royal family .
does that bother you ?
how do you deal with that ?
katharina wagner : you 're born with your name , you ca n't choose it .
of course , you could say , if i 'd become a lawyer , i would n't have to deal with all this , but i love my career as stage director .
i try to separate my private life from my work and i hope that i 'm not always viewed as a wagner but as an independent artist .
when i give an interview or take a position on my work , i do n't do that as katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of richard wagner , but as the director of " meistersinger von nürnberg . "
i 'm not any more interesting because i am related to a famous composer ; that was his achievement and not mine - and i 'd rather talk about mine .
do you have contact with your family members who are also well-known figures in the music world ?
no , i stay out of all the family disputes .
is going to bayreuth like going home for you ?
of course , i know the house quite well and all the customs there , which is a certain advantage .
on the other hand , the pressure on directors there - and not just me , but all my colleagues - is very high .
you grew up and learned there in the house .
what is it like to come back as a director ?
the people know what i can and what i ca n't do , so i do n't think there 'll be any authority problems .
i was an assistant for years and they all know me .
i do n't have a problem with it , but i ca n't speak for the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina 's father wolfgang has directed the festival for 40 years what did you learn from your father that is indispensable for you in your career today ?
the technical know-how .
although my father and i clearly follow very different aesthetic lines , there 's a basis of technique that every stage director needs and i learned this from my father .
for example , how people stand on the stage , making it appear as if they 're looking at each other while they can also see the monitors - practical things that you need to direct .
why " meistersinger von nürnberg " ?
when a piece is offered to me , i think about whether it says something to me .
it that case , it did .
if my father had offered me " tristan " instead three years ago , i would 've said , " not yet . "
now i could manage it , but three years ago i would n't have done it .
could you give a few examples of how your aesthetic ideas differ from your father 's ?
as far as costumes go , my father prefers historical or timeless styles - he always has historical elements , even in his more timeless productions .
but i prefer modern clothing , also because of the movement .
that 's a concrete example .
where did you set your " meistersinger " ?
not in the middle ages .
it 's also not important that it takes place in nuremberg .
for me , nuremberg is a synonym for a spiritual location .
my production takes place in a room with very many doors , that 's also extremely closed and seems very heavy .
ultimately , new impulses from the outside come in - the nuremberg system ca n't exist any more as it did and nuremberg changes at the end of the second act .
innovation collides with tradition , which for me is the most exiting issues in the opera , that these master singers are really a big art class .
and that 's one of the biggest questions : what 's the relationship between innovation and tradition , and art - or the artist - and society ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wait for years to get tickets in reference to you becoming the next festival director , your father has said , " if she can , then she should . "
how do you see this statement ?
that 's typical of my father .
whoever knows my father will know that that 's original wolfgang wagner .
although he said , " if she can and wants to . "
which conditions have to be met for you to accept the position ?
it does n't only depend on me .
it mostly depends on other people .
at the moment , my father is both manager and director in one and this constellation will change .
there will be four managers .
these four people have high expectations for a festival director , which i do n't know if i can fulfill .
it 's also a matter that needs to be discussed - what do the managers expect , what do i expect from them .
these things just all have to fit .
what 's the most important condition for you ?
that the artistic quality remains .

she added : " victims now get offered so much help it is fantastic .
" i had support every day and i had a domestic violence officer come to court with me . "
lidford was jailed at mold crown court last friday after being convicted of four specimen assault charges at a trial in february .
during the trial , it emerged that over the course of their five-year relationship he had subjected miss morris to abuse .
blanket on about five occasions lidford , a heating engineer , had forced her to lie in a dog 's bed , and threatened that if she looked from under the blanket she would be assaulted .
once , lidford had kicked her repeatedly after she looked out from under the blanket , the court heard .
she suffered swelling and bruising across her back and could not move , but lidford had refused to call an ambulance .
she wept as she told the jury that she had reported matters to the police in the past , including an incident when lidford whipped her with a dog lead .
but she had always withdrawn the allegations , believing that he loved her and would change .
elen pierce , director of welsh women 's aid , said : " women who encounter domestic abuse are the victims of systematic and repeated behaviour which exercises control , and many need help simply to identify and understand what is happening .
she said the wales domestic abuse helpline is a free , confidential and bilingual 24-hour helpline on 0808 80 10 800 which can help victims of abuse and give them support and practical advice on what to do .

the action by almost 600 staff was called when talks between glasgow city council and union unison collapsed .
council bosses have warned the action could leave vulnerable groups without their usual level of support services .
among those who could be left without care services while the strike takes place are methadone users , vulnerable offenders and " at risk " children .
mike kirby , unison 's glasgow convener , said : " these are the staff that work day-to-day to ensure that people get their support to enable them to live full lives .
" no-one wants a strike in this area , and the council could resolve it tomorrow . "
unison says as a result of the pay review many workers will be forced to take downgraded jobs , and face cuts in their salaries of up to £ 1,000 a year .
but a spokesman for glasgow city council said the vast majority of social care staff would get a pay increase as a result of the review .
salaries would also be protected until march 2009 , he said .
he added it was " extremely worrying " that unison was " willing to jeopardise the care of some of glasgow 's most vulnerable people in pursuit of their demands " .

conservative mp edward leigh said anti-social behaviour in england and wales was costing £ 3.4bn a year .
the public accounts committee said the home office had not researched which anti-social behaviour measures brought in since 1997 were most effective .
but the government said tackling the problem remained " a top priority " .
home office minister tony mcnulty said : " we have equipped local authorities , the police and other agencies with unprecedented tools and powers to deal with perpetrators .
the department should pull itself together edward leigh public accounts committee " the recent local government user satisfaction survey shows that in 94 % of local authority areas the public 's perception of anti-social behaviour fell significantly between 2003/4 and 2005/6 .
" but we are not complacent and will study the report closely . "
however , the tories said labour had ignored the problems behind anti-social behaviour .
speaking as the committee 's report on tackling anti-social behaviour was published , mr leigh said anti-social behaviour after dark ranged from " drunken skylarking and intimidation to out-and-out criminal activity " .
he said the home office " has not done any work nationwide to find out which ones work best " among the " barrage " of measures available .
" we need to try to head off a new generation of persistent offenders by directing appropriate support at families whose youngsters are at risk of falling into anti-social behaviour , " mr leigh said .
the committee had questioned the home office and its respect taskforce about 893 cases of anti-social behaviour interventions reviewed by the national audit office .
persistent offenders the committee criticised the home office for not assessing what methods worked well on which groups of offenders .
for example , the national audit office found that " a simple and cheap warning letter " often deterred further bad behaviour " for many tearaways " .
but for " a hard-core of persistent offenders ... asbos -lsb- are -rsb- part and parcel of its way of life and to be shrugged off accordingly " .
" enforcement action against these people must be absolutely rigorous and , where they persist in their breaches of orders , there should be no hesitation in bringing prosecutions , cases should also be considered for referral to the crown court which can impose custodial sentences , " the committee said .
saying " the department should pull itself together " , it also criticised the home office for providing " duff information " to the national audit office about perceptions around the country of anti-social behaviour .
the committee said perceptions varied by gender , area and age , with people most likely to perceive high levels in areas of greatest social deprivation .
shadow home secretary david davis said : " this failure comes about because labour 's approach has been to get the headline and ignore the problem .

a un spokesman said the application had been rejected in line with a 1971 resolution , under which the un switched recognition from taiwan to china .
taiwan , which has tried to join the un more than 14 times , said it deeply regretted the world body 's decision .
china views taiwan as a breakaway province of the mainland .
though both have been governed separately since the civil war in 1949 , china has vowed to use force if it ever moves towards independence .
the chinese foreign ministry last week said taiwan 's un bid was " doomed to failure " .
referendum plans taiwanese president chen shui-bian submitted a letter of application to the un secretary general last week , arguing that taiwan , as the world 's 18th largest economy and seventh largest investor , should not be excluded from the body .
rejecting the application on tuesday , the un cited its adherence to the one china policy agreed under the 1971 resolution , which acknowledges taiwan is a part of china .
until 1971 , the government in taipei held the un seat for china rather than beijing .
taiwanese foreign ministry spokesman david wang said the government regretted the un move , saying it had been blocked " for political reasons " .
" the 1971 resolution should be reviewed , as it fails to address the question of the right of representation and participation by the taiwanese people , " he said .
the decision to apply to the un under the title taiwan for the first time rather than the republic of china reflects efforts by the independence-leaning president chen to stress the island 's distinctiveness from mainland china , the bbc 's caroline gluck in taipei says .
despite the setback , the government still plans to push ahead with a referendum on joining the un alongside presidential and legislation elections next year , despite concerns from washington and beijing , our correspondent adds .

the new prime minister has even appointed a minister with joint responsibility for the two areas .
but charities are planning a major campaign that they believe will expose a flaw in the plan .
while major british companies are investing in the developing world , much of their profit is still banked elsewhere .
' capital flight ' bbc radio 4 's file on 4 has learned that almost £ 100bn a year is taken out of africa through accounting practices - several times what the continent receives in aid .
charles abugre , head of policy and advocacy for christian aid , said this capital flight amounted to " the looting of the continent " .
" if we ca n't deal with it , there 's no way we can conceive of poor countries detaching themselves from aid dependency , " he said .
" the issue is slowly coming to the fore .
it is the missing link in the whole of international development campaigning . "
reporting from kenya on the activities of foreign companies there , file on 4 has discovered evidence of questionable accounting practices - both legal and illegal .
because of the way kenyan tax laws have evolved , foreign companies can quite lawfully contribute very little in the way of taxes to the country 's economy we want our sisters to stop their corporate citizens who may not be paying their due taxes here mukhisa kituyi minister for trade and industry and some other international companies have been found to have acted illegally in falsely declaring amounts of tea that are being exported to the uk .
' under-reporting ' in mombasa , kenya 's main port town , the tea board has an official working with customs officials to investigate some startling discrepancies .
kenya 's official export statistics say almost 50 million kilos of tea left there in 2005 bound for britain .
but the british import statistics showed 75 million kilos - one and a half times as much - arriving here from kenya .
a former head of domestic tax for kenya , jack ranguma , told the programme he believed the mismatch was created by customs fraud .
in short , companies shipping tea to the uk were under-reporting exports in order to avoid paying tax , he said .
" this shows two things , " he said .
" one , there is a great deal of corruption in kenya , which is why they are able to prepare documentation which are not consistent with the figures .
but more importantly , the companies involved are transferring income .
" in bald terms what they are doing is to deny kenya that tax revenue . "
' dishonourable mischief ' and the country 's minister for trade and industry , mukhisa kituyi , called on developed countries to put pressure on companies to behave .
" we want our sisters to stop their corporate citizens who may not be paying their due taxes here , " he said .
" that that 's one of the ways of enhancing our bilateral friendship . "
he also said kenya was trying to increase its capacity to prevent these practices from depleting his government 's resources .
" i think we 'll catch up with them if that 's what 's happening , " he said .
" if we find any dishonourable mischief we 'll be heading towards it . "
task force but mr ranguma , who retired a year ago , expressed doubts about whether the kenyan government had the commitment and the resources to tackle illegal trade practices .
he told the programme he had also discovered widespread under-reporting of profits by flower companies , many of which are owned by europeans .
" i formed a task force to audit the flower companies and it did come up with some preliminary results that pointed towards suppression of income , " he said .
matters about tax are a matter for the kenyan government ray kyles acting british high commissioner " if you do not declare the full value of income that you have earned as a business , it means you are underpaying taxes .
but i left office before i concluded the investigation and i understand a number of people have since been moved from it . "
what mr ranguma had uncovered was the illegal use in kenya of a legitimate practice known as " transfer pricing " - the means by which firms value their goods for tax purposes when they move them across international borders .
in effect , this allows companies to undervalue their products when they leave kenya and to place their profits elsewhere .
british exports when asked what had happened to the investigation , mr kituyi promised to raise it with the finance minister .
but file on 4 found there were also perfectly legal accounting practices which allowed british firms to register their profits outside kenya .
britain 's acting high commissioner to kenya , ray kyles , said it was not the job of foreign governments to encourage their corporate investors to pay tax .
" matters about tax are a matter for the kenyan government , " he said .
" our role here is to recognise the advantages to britain of increasing its exports and in helping british companies look for opportunities overseas .
" we think there 's a win here . "

because of the way kenyan tax laws have evolved , foreign companies can quite lawfully contribute very little in the way of taxes to the country 's economy we want our sisters to stop their corporate citizens who may not be paying their due taxes here mukhisa kituyi minister for trade and industry and some other international companies have been found to have acted illegally in falsely declaring amounts of tea that are being exported to the uk .
' under-reporting ' in mombasa , kenya 's main port town , the tea board has an official working with customs officials to investigate some startling discrepancies .
kenya 's official export statistics say almost 50 million kilos of tea left there in 2005 bound for britain .
but the british import statistics showed 75 million kilos - one and a half times as much - arriving here from kenya .
a former head of domestic tax for kenya , jack ranguma , told the programme he believed the mismatch was created by customs fraud .
in short , companies shipping tea to the uk were under-reporting exports in order to avoid paying tax , he said .
" this shows two things , " he said .
" one , there is a great deal of corruption in kenya , which is why they are able to prepare documentation which are not consistent with the figures .
but more importantly , the companies involved are transferring income .
" in bald terms what they are doing is to deny kenya that tax revenue . "
' dishonourable mischief ' and the country 's minister for trade and industry , mukhisa kituyi , called on developed countries to put pressure on companies to behave .
" we want our sisters to stop their corporate citizens who may not be paying their due taxes here , " he said .
" that that 's one of the ways of enhancing our bilateral friendship . "
he also said kenya was trying to increase its capacity to prevent these practices from depleting his government 's resources .
" i think we 'll catch up with them if that 's what 's happening , " he said .
" if we find any dishonourable mischief we 'll be heading towards it . "
task force but mr ranguma , who retired a year ago , expressed doubts about whether the kenyan government had the commitment and the resources to tackle illegal trade practices .
he told the programme he had also discovered widespread under-reporting of profits by flower companies , many of which are owned by europeans .
" i formed a task force to audit the flower companies and it did come up with some preliminary results that pointed towards suppression of income , " he said .
matters about tax are a matter for the kenyan government ray kyles acting british high commissioner " if you do not declare the full value of income that you have earned as a business , it means you are underpaying taxes .
but i left office before i concluded the investigation and i understand a number of people have since been moved from it . "
what mr ranguma had uncovered was the illegal use in kenya of a legitimate practice known as " transfer pricing " - the means by which firms value their goods for tax purposes when they move them across international borders .
in effect , this allows companies to undervalue their products when they leave kenya and to place their profits elsewhere .
british exports when asked what had happened to the investigation , mr kituyi promised to raise it with the finance minister .
but file on 4 found there were also perfectly legal accounting practices which allowed british firms to register their profits outside kenya .
britain 's acting high commissioner to kenya , ray kyles , said it was not the job of foreign governments to encourage their corporate investors to pay tax .
" matters about tax are a matter for the kenyan government , " he said .
" our role here is to recognise the advantages to britain of increasing its exports and in helping british companies look for opportunities overseas .
" we think there 's a win here . "
