program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 23.12.2007 germany 's cinematic legacy fills federal archives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the blue angel " starring marlene dietrich is one of the archive 's prize possessions ever wondered why everyone gets so excited when german films succeed these days ?
it ’ s usually a celebration of a return to form of one of the world ’ s most renowned film industries . as befitting one of the birthplaces of cinema , germany enjoys a position of great standing in the world of film .
after all , max skladanowsky presented the first " living pictures " in berlin on nov .
1 , 1895 , beating france 's lumiere brothers to the honor by a month .
as a result of germany 's long association with the moving image , the country today possesses a huge number of archived film rolls , a heritage lovingly cared for by the federal film archives , which operates out of berlin and six other cities .
all in all , germany has in storage around 150,000 movies on 1 million rolls of film .
the berlin department is the home of the original skladanowsky film , which is stored along with many other historical works in what is one of the most comprehensive film archives in the world , documenting more than 100 years of movie history .
reflecting german cultural tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f.w. murnau 's " nosferatu " is a classic vampire film since the federal film archives were established in the 1950s , this venerable institution has acquired and catalogued a vast collection of films of all genres , digitally restoring a portion of them .
" we seek a wide variety of films , refusing to restrict ourselves purely to top cultural and famous feature productions , " karl griep , a departmental head at the archives office in berlin explained in an interview with dpa .
" this means our collection is comprehensive and reflects the society , fashion and cultural tastes of germany at different periods , from the silent movie era onwards , through the weimar and nazi periods to the present time , " he said .
one of the most prestigious periods in german film is catalogued at the berlin facility .
when a production company called ufa -lrb- later defa -rrb- in 1921 gained control of the babelsberg studios , south of berlin , a legendary era in film-making and film history began in germany .
a collection of classics among films made there were " the cabinet of dr. caligari , " " nosferatu , " the fritz lang classic " testament to dr. mabuse " and the 1930-made " blue angel , " starring marlene dietrich .
all these are stored with pride by the federal archives .
this shimmering cinematic bubble , however , burst with the nazis ' rise to power .
ufa was quickly turned into a propaganda factory by hitler 's close associate and minister joseph goebbels .
the studio 's mission was perverted into churning out anti-semitic and rabble-rousing films like “ hitlerjunge quex ” to motivate germans to support the war .
the nazi period in german history and the wochenschau films made during that time form an inevitable part of the federal archives .
the archives ' extensive collection and thorough historical chronology attracts visitors from many parts of the world every month .
some are movie-makers , others film researchers , historians or television program planners , eager to view or loan the available material .
post-war plundering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz lang 's " testament to dr. mabuse " is one of the protected films " the japanese are strong users of our archives and frequent visitors to our access rooms , " griep said .
" so are film representatives from scandinavia and other european countries , but not russia .
they keep the material they seized in 1945 … sometimes my impression is that that they do n't know themselves precisely what it is they have of ours anymore . ”
griep admitted that there was a degree of confusion over the ownership and place of origin of many of the disputed russian films , some of which were originally german before being translated into russian by the soviet union 's cultural authorities and then translated back with no record of the film 's original titles .
he believes that at least 100 rare german films had been lost in this way .
literally explosive in addition to housing some of the most precious examples of german film-making , the berlin premises also host germany 's largest nitrate-film storage facility , which is equipped with a staff of 80 archivists , restorers , technicians , historians and photo specialists .
five of the staff are engineers , experts in electronics and chemistry .
considerable care is taken there , due to the explosive nature of cellulose nitrate - the plastic which was commonly used for film-based photographic materials up to the 1950s .
strict fire regulations are in force , and technical devices deployed to save all sources of heating .
large outside earth safety mounds face sensitive parts of the facility , so that if explosions occur the blasts can be cushioned .
considering what treasures are held in the nearby archives , there is no such thing as being overcautious at the federal film archives . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finally , after considering all the consequences of pet ownership , you relent .
are you a responsible parent ?
that now depends on who you buy the dog from . it is unlikely that the excited young recipient of a cute and cuddly christmas puppy will ask where the little bundle of festive joy came from and whether it was treated humanely on its way to the stocking .
these , however , are the exact questions parents should be asking if they are considering buying an animal as a present . the common pitfalls of giving pets at christmas are well known : the initial excitement wears off quickly for the recipient , leaving the parents to deal with the less fun aspect of having to look after the animal or find a new home for it .
sometimes the easiest but most irresponsible way out is to leave the unwanted pet by the side of the motorway . but there are other consequences which have to be considered by those who have accepted the responsibility of bringing a pet into the family at christmas .
parents should be aware that an unscrupulous and criminal element has developed a market for puppy trafficking ; an enterprise which cares little for the welfare of the animal . demand for cheap pedigrees fuels trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedigree dogs are in demand a sharp increase in puppy-boot sales on the borders of germany and austria and discount pets available via the internet has authorities and activists up in arms .
the fear is that , with the demand for cheap but pedigree dogs on the increase , dogs are being bred for the christmas market not by experienced breeders but in dog-factories in eastern europe . " dogs are bred under circumstances unimaginable to any serious breeder , " katja wolf from austria 's cynology association told dpa .
" the dealers regard the animals just as merchandise .
it is dirty and the animals contract all sorts of illnesses .
if a bitch can not have any more offspring or there are complications , they are simply killed . " as many as 30 puppies at a time are ferried across the border in car boots by the dog-mafia to be sold in the parking lots of shopping centers , often for one-tenth of the price charged by registered breeders , officials believe .

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .
the general view in germany is that merkel has placed too high a premium on foreign policy , putting domestic politics on the back burner .
the chancellor 's constant jet-setting around the world to meet with international leaders prompted a telling cartoon in the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel : bush , reclining in an armchair on his crawford ranch asks merkel , " well then , how was your trip to germany ? "
but some question whether the chancellor has really achieved all that much on the international stage .

it ’ s usually a celebration of a return to form of one of the world ’ s most renowned film industries . as befitting one of the birthplaces of cinema , germany enjoys a position of great standing in the world of film .
after all , max skladanowsky presented the first " living pictures " in berlin on nov .
1 , 1895 , beating france 's lumiere brothers to the honor by a month .
as a result of germany 's long association with the moving image , the country today possesses a huge number of archived film rolls , a heritage lovingly cared for by the federal film archives , which operates out of berlin and six other cities .
all in all , germany has in storage around 150,000 movies on 1 million rolls of film .
the berlin department is the home of the original skladanowsky film , which is stored along with many other historical works in what is one of the most comprehensive film archives in the world , documenting more than 100 years of movie history .
reflecting german cultural tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f.w. murnau 's " nosferatu " is a classic vampire film since the federal film archives were established in the 1950s , this venerable institution has acquired and catalogued a vast collection of films of all genres , digitally restoring a portion of them .
" we seek a wide variety of films , refusing to restrict ourselves purely to top cultural and famous feature productions , " karl griep , a departmental head at the archives office in berlin explained in an interview with dpa .
" this means our collection is comprehensive and reflects the society , fashion and cultural tastes of germany at different periods , from the silent movie era onwards , through the weimar and nazi periods to the present time , " he said .
one of the most prestigious periods in german film is catalogued at the berlin facility .
when a production company called ufa -lrb- later defa -rrb- in 1921 gained control of the babelsberg studios , south of berlin , a legendary era in film-making and film history began in germany .
a collection of classics among films made there were " the cabinet of dr. caligari , " " nosferatu , " the fritz lang classic " testament to dr. mabuse " and the 1930-made " blue angel , " starring marlene dietrich .
all these are stored with pride by the federal archives .
this shimmering cinematic bubble , however , burst with the nazis ' rise to power .
ufa was quickly turned into a propaganda factory by hitler 's close associate and minister joseph goebbels .
the studio 's mission was perverted into churning out anti-semitic and rabble-rousing films like “ hitlerjunge quex ” to motivate germans to support the war .
the nazi period in german history and the wochenschau films made during that time form an inevitable part of the federal archives .
the archives ' extensive collection and thorough historical chronology attracts visitors from many parts of the world every month .
some are movie-makers , others film researchers , historians or television program planners , eager to view or loan the available material .
post-war plundering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz lang 's " testament to dr. mabuse " is one of the protected films " the japanese are strong users of our archives and frequent visitors to our access rooms , " griep said .
" so are film representatives from scandinavia and other european countries , but not russia .
they keep the material they seized in 1945 … sometimes my impression is that that they do n't know themselves precisely what it is they have of ours anymore . ”
griep admitted that there was a degree of confusion over the ownership and place of origin of many of the disputed russian films , some of which were originally german before being translated into russian by the soviet union 's cultural authorities and then translated back with no record of the film 's original titles .
he believes that at least 100 rare german films had been lost in this way .
literally explosive in addition to housing some of the most precious examples of german film-making , the berlin premises also host germany 's largest nitrate-film storage facility , which is equipped with a staff of 80 archivists , restorers , technicians , historians and photo specialists .
five of the staff are engineers , experts in electronics and chemistry .
considerable care is taken there , due to the explosive nature of cellulose nitrate - the plastic which was commonly used for film-based photographic materials up to the 1950s .
strict fire regulations are in force , and technical devices deployed to save all sources of heating .
large outside earth safety mounds face sensitive parts of the facility , so that if explosions occur the blasts can be cushioned .
considering what treasures are held in the nearby archives , there is no such thing as being overcautious at the federal film archives . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .

leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .
the general view in germany is that merkel has placed too high a premium on foreign policy , putting domestic politics on the back burner .
the chancellor 's constant jet-setting around the world to meet with international leaders prompted a telling cartoon in the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel : bush , reclining in an armchair on his crawford ranch asks merkel , " well then , how was your trip to germany ? "
but some question whether the chancellor has really achieved all that much on the international stage .
" she -lrb- merkel -rrb- has presented no foreign policy initiatives of her own , no bold plans , " daily berliner zeitung wrote recently . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finally , after considering all the consequences of pet ownership , you relent .
are you a responsible parent ?
that now depends on who you buy the dog from . it is unlikely that the excited young recipient of a cute and cuddly christmas puppy will ask where the little bundle of festive joy came from and whether it was treated humanely on its way to the stocking .

it ’ s usually a celebration of a return to form of one of the world ’ s most renowned film industries . as befitting one of the birthplaces of cinema , germany enjoys a position of great standing in the world of film .
after all , max skladanowsky presented the first " living pictures " in berlin on nov .
1 , 1895 , beating france 's lumiere brothers to the honor by a month .
as a result of germany 's long association with the moving image , the country today possesses a huge number of archived film rolls , a heritage lovingly cared for by the federal film archives , which operates out of berlin and six other cities .
all in all , germany has in storage around 150,000 movies on 1 million rolls of film .
the berlin department is the home of the original skladanowsky film , which is stored along with many other historical works in what is one of the most comprehensive film archives in the world , documenting more than 100 years of movie history .
reflecting german cultural tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f.w. murnau 's " nosferatu " is a classic vampire film since the federal film archives were established in the 1950s , this venerable institution has acquired and catalogued a vast collection of films of all genres , digitally restoring a portion of them .
" we seek a wide variety of films , refusing to restrict ourselves purely to top cultural and famous feature productions , " karl griep , a departmental head at the archives office in berlin explained in an interview with dpa .
" this means our collection is comprehensive and reflects the society , fashion and cultural tastes of germany at different periods , from the silent movie era onwards , through the weimar and nazi periods to the present time , " he said .
one of the most prestigious periods in german film is catalogued at the berlin facility .
when a production company called ufa -lrb- later defa -rrb- in 1921 gained control of the babelsberg studios , south of berlin , a legendary era in film-making and film history began in germany .
a collection of classics among films made there were " the cabinet of dr. caligari , " " nosferatu , " the fritz lang classic " testament to dr. mabuse " and the 1930-made " blue angel , " starring marlene dietrich .
all these are stored with pride by the federal archives .
this shimmering cinematic bubble , however , burst with the nazis ' rise to power .
ufa was quickly turned into a propaganda factory by hitler 's close associate and minister joseph goebbels .
the studio 's mission was perverted into churning out anti-semitic and rabble-rousing films like “ hitlerjunge quex ” to motivate germans to support the war .
the nazi period in german history and the wochenschau films made during that time form an inevitable part of the federal archives .
the archives ' extensive collection and thorough historical chronology attracts visitors from many parts of the world every month .
some are movie-makers , others film researchers , historians or television program planners , eager to view or loan the available material .
post-war plundering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz lang 's " testament to dr. mabuse " is one of the protected films " the japanese are strong users of our archives and frequent visitors to our access rooms , " griep said .
" so are film representatives from scandinavia and other european countries , but not russia .
they keep the material they seized in 1945 … sometimes my impression is that that they do n't know themselves precisely what it is they have of ours anymore . ”
griep admitted that there was a degree of confusion over the ownership and place of origin of many of the disputed russian films , some of which were originally german before being translated into russian by the soviet union 's cultural authorities and then translated back with no record of the film 's original titles .
he believes that at least 100 rare german films had been lost in this way .
literally explosive in addition to housing some of the most precious examples of german film-making , the berlin premises also host germany 's largest nitrate-film storage facility , which is equipped with a staff of 80 archivists , restorers , technicians , historians and photo specialists .
five of the staff are engineers , experts in electronics and chemistry .
considerable care is taken there , due to the explosive nature of cellulose nitrate - the plastic which was commonly used for film-based photographic materials up to the 1950s .
strict fire regulations are in force , and technical devices deployed to save all sources of heating .
large outside earth safety mounds face sensitive parts of the facility , so that if explosions occur the blasts can be cushioned .
considering what treasures are held in the nearby archives , there is no such thing as being overcautious at the federal film archives . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it ’ s usually a celebration of a return to form of one of the world ’ s most renowned film industries . as befitting one of the birthplaces of cinema , germany enjoys a position of great standing in the world of film .
after all , max skladanowsky presented the first " living pictures " in berlin on nov .
1 , 1895 , beating france 's lumiere brothers to the honor by a month .
as a result of germany 's long association with the moving image , the country today possesses a huge number of archived film rolls , a heritage lovingly cared for by the federal film archives , which operates out of berlin and six other cities .
all in all , germany has in storage around 150,000 movies on 1 million rolls of film .
the berlin department is the home of the original skladanowsky film , which is stored along with many other historical works in what is one of the most comprehensive film archives in the world , documenting more than 100 years of movie history .
reflecting german cultural tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f.w. murnau 's " nosferatu " is a classic vampire film since the federal film archives were established in the 1950s , this venerable institution has acquired and catalogued a vast collection of films of all genres , digitally restoring a portion of them .
" we seek a wide variety of films , refusing to restrict ourselves purely to top cultural and famous feature productions , " karl griep , a departmental head at the archives office in berlin explained in an interview with dpa .
" this means our collection is comprehensive and reflects the society , fashion and cultural tastes of germany at different periods , from the silent movie era onwards , through the weimar and nazi periods to the present time , " he said .
one of the most prestigious periods in german film is catalogued at the berlin facility .
when a production company called ufa -lrb- later defa -rrb- in 1921 gained control of the babelsberg studios , south of berlin , a legendary era in film-making and film history began in germany .
a collection of classics among films made there were " the cabinet of dr. caligari , " " nosferatu , " the fritz lang classic " testament to dr. mabuse " and the 1930-made " blue angel , " starring marlene dietrich .
all these are stored with pride by the federal archives .
this shimmering cinematic bubble , however , burst with the nazis ' rise to power .
ufa was quickly turned into a propaganda factory by hitler 's close associate and minister joseph goebbels .
the studio 's mission was perverted into churning out anti-semitic and rabble-rousing films like “ hitlerjunge quex ” to motivate germans to support the war .
the nazi period in german history and the wochenschau films made during that time form an inevitable part of the federal archives .
the archives ' extensive collection and thorough historical chronology attracts visitors from many parts of the world every month .
some are movie-makers , others film researchers , historians or television program planners , eager to view or loan the available material .
post-war plundering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz lang 's " testament to dr. mabuse " is one of the protected films " the japanese are strong users of our archives and frequent visitors to our access rooms , " griep said .
" so are film representatives from scandinavia and other european countries , but not russia .
they keep the material they seized in 1945 … sometimes my impression is that that they do n't know themselves precisely what it is they have of ours anymore . ”
griep admitted that there was a degree of confusion over the ownership and place of origin of many of the disputed russian films , some of which were originally german before being translated into russian by the soviet union 's cultural authorities and then translated back with no record of the film 's original titles .
he believes that at least 100 rare german films had been lost in this way .
literally explosive in addition to housing some of the most precious examples of german film-making , the berlin premises also host germany 's largest nitrate-film storage facility , which is equipped with a staff of 80 archivists , restorers , technicians , historians and photo specialists .
five of the staff are engineers , experts in electronics and chemistry .
considerable care is taken there , due to the explosive nature of cellulose nitrate - the plastic which was commonly used for film-based photographic materials up to the 1950s .
strict fire regulations are in force , and technical devices deployed to save all sources of heating .
large outside earth safety mounds face sensitive parts of the facility , so that if explosions occur the blasts can be cushioned .
considering what treasures are held in the nearby archives , there is no such thing as being overcautious at the federal film archives . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .
the general view in germany is that merkel has placed too high a premium on foreign policy , putting domestic politics on the back burner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 23.12.2007 germany 's cinematic legacy fills federal archives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the blue angel " starring marlene dietrich is one of the archive 's prize possessions ever wondered why everyone gets so excited when german films succeed these days ?
it ’ s usually a celebration of a return to form of one of the world ’ s most renowned film industries . as befitting one of the birthplaces of cinema , germany enjoys a position of great standing in the world of film .
after all , max skladanowsky presented the first " living pictures " in berlin on nov .
1 , 1895 , beating france 's lumiere brothers to the honor by a month .
as a result of germany 's long association with the moving image , the country today possesses a huge number of archived film rolls , a heritage lovingly cared for by the federal film archives , which operates out of berlin and six other cities .
all in all , germany has in storage around 150,000 movies on 1 million rolls of film .
the berlin department is the home of the original skladanowsky film , which is stored along with many other historical works in what is one of the most comprehensive film archives in the world , documenting more than 100 years of movie history .
reflecting german cultural tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f.w. murnau 's " nosferatu " is a classic vampire film since the federal film archives were established in the 1950s , this venerable institution has acquired and catalogued a vast collection of films of all genres , digitally restoring a portion of them .
" we seek a wide variety of films , refusing to restrict ourselves purely to top cultural and famous feature productions , " karl griep , a departmental head at the archives office in berlin explained in an interview with dpa .
" this means our collection is comprehensive and reflects the society , fashion and cultural tastes of germany at different periods , from the silent movie era onwards , through the weimar and nazi periods to the present time , " he said .
one of the most prestigious periods in german film is catalogued at the berlin facility .
when a production company called ufa -lrb- later defa -rrb- in 1921 gained control of the babelsberg studios , south of berlin , a legendary era in film-making and film history began in germany .
a collection of classics among films made there were " the cabinet of dr. caligari , " " nosferatu , " the fritz lang classic " testament to dr. mabuse " and the 1930-made " blue angel , " starring marlene dietrich .
all these are stored with pride by the federal archives .
this shimmering cinematic bubble , however , burst with the nazis ' rise to power .
ufa was quickly turned into a propaganda factory by hitler 's close associate and minister joseph goebbels .
the studio 's mission was perverted into churning out anti-semitic and rabble-rousing films like “ hitlerjunge quex ” to motivate germans to support the war .
the nazi period in german history and the wochenschau films made during that time form an inevitable part of the federal archives .
the archives ' extensive collection and thorough historical chronology attracts visitors from many parts of the world every month .
some are movie-makers , others film researchers , historians or television program planners , eager to view or loan the available material .
post-war plundering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz lang 's " testament to dr. mabuse " is one of the protected films " the japanese are strong users of our archives and frequent visitors to our access rooms , " griep said .
" so are film representatives from scandinavia and other european countries , but not russia .
they keep the material they seized in 1945 … sometimes my impression is that that they do n't know themselves precisely what it is they have of ours anymore . ”
griep admitted that there was a degree of confusion over the ownership and place of origin of many of the disputed russian films , some of which were originally german before being translated into russian by the soviet union 's cultural authorities and then translated back with no record of the film 's original titles .
he believes that at least 100 rare german films had been lost in this way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 23.12.2007 germany 's cinematic legacy fills federal archives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the blue angel " starring marlene dietrich is one of the archive 's prize possessions ever wondered why everyone gets so excited when german films succeed these days ?
it ’ s usually a celebration of a return to form of one of the world ’ s most renowned film industries . as befitting one of the birthplaces of cinema , germany enjoys a position of great standing in the world of film .
after all , max skladanowsky presented the first " living pictures " in berlin on nov .
1 , 1895 , beating france 's lumiere brothers to the honor by a month .
as a result of germany 's long association with the moving image , the country today possesses a huge number of archived film rolls , a heritage lovingly cared for by the federal film archives , which operates out of berlin and six other cities .
all in all , germany has in storage around 150,000 movies on 1 million rolls of film .
the berlin department is the home of the original skladanowsky film , which is stored along with many other historical works in what is one of the most comprehensive film archives in the world , documenting more than 100 years of movie history .
reflecting german cultural tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f.w. murnau 's " nosferatu " is a classic vampire film since the federal film archives were established in the 1950s , this venerable institution has acquired and catalogued a vast collection of films of all genres , digitally restoring a portion of them .
" we seek a wide variety of films , refusing to restrict ourselves purely to top cultural and famous feature productions , " karl griep , a departmental head at the archives office in berlin explained in an interview with dpa .
" this means our collection is comprehensive and reflects the society , fashion and cultural tastes of germany at different periods , from the silent movie era onwards , through the weimar and nazi periods to the present time , " he said .
one of the most prestigious periods in german film is catalogued at the berlin facility .
when a production company called ufa -lrb- later defa -rrb- in 1921 gained control of the babelsberg studios , south of berlin , a legendary era in film-making and film history began in germany .
a collection of classics among films made there were " the cabinet of dr. caligari , " " nosferatu , " the fritz lang classic " testament to dr. mabuse " and the 1930-made " blue angel , " starring marlene dietrich .
all these are stored with pride by the federal archives .
this shimmering cinematic bubble , however , burst with the nazis ' rise to power .
ufa was quickly turned into a propaganda factory by hitler 's close associate and minister joseph goebbels .
the studio 's mission was perverted into churning out anti-semitic and rabble-rousing films like “ hitlerjunge quex ” to motivate germans to support the war .
the nazi period in german history and the wochenschau films made during that time form an inevitable part of the federal archives .
the archives ' extensive collection and thorough historical chronology attracts visitors from many parts of the world every month .
some are movie-makers , others film researchers , historians or television program planners , eager to view or loan the available material .
post-war plundering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz lang 's " testament to dr. mabuse " is one of the protected films " the japanese are strong users of our archives and frequent visitors to our access rooms , " griep said .
" so are film representatives from scandinavia and other european countries , but not russia .
they keep the material they seized in 1945 … sometimes my impression is that that they do n't know themselves precisely what it is they have of ours anymore . ”
griep admitted that there was a degree of confusion over the ownership and place of origin of many of the disputed russian films , some of which were originally german before being translated into russian by the soviet union 's cultural authorities and then translated back with no record of the film 's original titles .
he believes that at least 100 rare german films had been lost in this way .
literally explosive in addition to housing some of the most precious examples of german film-making , the berlin premises also host germany 's largest nitrate-film storage facility , which is equipped with a staff of 80 archivists , restorers , technicians , historians and photo specialists .
five of the staff are engineers , experts in electronics and chemistry .
considerable care is taken there , due to the explosive nature of cellulose nitrate - the plastic which was commonly used for film-based photographic materials up to the 1950s .
strict fire regulations are in force , and technical devices deployed to save all sources of heating .
large outside earth safety mounds face sensitive parts of the facility , so that if explosions occur the blasts can be cushioned .
considering what treasures are held in the nearby archives , there is no such thing as being overcautious at the federal film archives . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it ’ s usually a celebration of a return to form of one of the world ’ s most renowned film industries . as befitting one of the birthplaces of cinema , germany enjoys a position of great standing in the world of film .
after all , max skladanowsky presented the first " living pictures " in berlin on nov .
1 , 1895 , beating france 's lumiere brothers to the honor by a month .
as a result of germany 's long association with the moving image , the country today possesses a huge number of archived film rolls , a heritage lovingly cared for by the federal film archives , which operates out of berlin and six other cities .
all in all , germany has in storage around 150,000 movies on 1 million rolls of film .
the berlin department is the home of the original skladanowsky film , which is stored along with many other historical works in what is one of the most comprehensive film archives in the world , documenting more than 100 years of movie history .
reflecting german cultural tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f.w. murnau 's " nosferatu " is a classic vampire film since the federal film archives were established in the 1950s , this venerable institution has acquired and catalogued a vast collection of films of all genres , digitally restoring a portion of them .
" we seek a wide variety of films , refusing to restrict ourselves purely to top cultural and famous feature productions , " karl griep , a departmental head at the archives office in berlin explained in an interview with dpa .
" this means our collection is comprehensive and reflects the society , fashion and cultural tastes of germany at different periods , from the silent movie era onwards , through the weimar and nazi periods to the present time , " he said .
one of the most prestigious periods in german film is catalogued at the berlin facility .
when a production company called ufa -lrb- later defa -rrb- in 1921 gained control of the babelsberg studios , south of berlin , a legendary era in film-making and film history began in germany .
a collection of classics among films made there were " the cabinet of dr. caligari , " " nosferatu , " the fritz lang classic " testament to dr. mabuse " and the 1930-made " blue angel , " starring marlene dietrich .
all these are stored with pride by the federal archives .
this shimmering cinematic bubble , however , burst with the nazis ' rise to power .
ufa was quickly turned into a propaganda factory by hitler 's close associate and minister joseph goebbels .
the studio 's mission was perverted into churning out anti-semitic and rabble-rousing films like “ hitlerjunge quex ” to motivate germans to support the war .
the nazi period in german history and the wochenschau films made during that time form an inevitable part of the federal archives .
the archives ' extensive collection and thorough historical chronology attracts visitors from many parts of the world every month .
some are movie-makers , others film researchers , historians or television program planners , eager to view or loan the available material .
post-war plundering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz lang 's " testament to dr. mabuse " is one of the protected films " the japanese are strong users of our archives and frequent visitors to our access rooms , " griep said .
" so are film representatives from scandinavia and other european countries , but not russia .
they keep the material they seized in 1945 … sometimes my impression is that that they do n't know themselves precisely what it is they have of ours anymore . ”
griep admitted that there was a degree of confusion over the ownership and place of origin of many of the disputed russian films , some of which were originally german before being translated into russian by the soviet union 's cultural authorities and then translated back with no record of the film 's original titles .
he believes that at least 100 rare german films had been lost in this way .
literally explosive in addition to housing some of the most precious examples of german film-making , the berlin premises also host germany 's largest nitrate-film storage facility , which is equipped with a staff of 80 archivists , restorers , technicians , historians and photo specialists .
five of the staff are engineers , experts in electronics and chemistry .
considerable care is taken there , due to the explosive nature of cellulose nitrate - the plastic which was commonly used for film-based photographic materials up to the 1950s .
strict fire regulations are in force , and technical devices deployed to save all sources of heating .
large outside earth safety mounds face sensitive parts of the facility , so that if explosions occur the blasts can be cushioned .
considering what treasures are held in the nearby archives , there is no such thing as being overcautious at the federal film archives . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .
the general view in germany is that merkel has placed too high a premium on foreign policy , putting domestic politics on the back burner .

finally , after considering all the consequences of pet ownership , you relent .
are you a responsible parent ?
that now depends on who you buy the dog from . it is unlikely that the excited young recipient of a cute and cuddly christmas puppy will ask where the little bundle of festive joy came from and whether it was treated humanely on its way to the stocking .
these , however , are the exact questions parents should be asking if they are considering buying an animal as a present . the common pitfalls of giving pets at christmas are well known : the initial excitement wears off quickly for the recipient , leaving the parents to deal with the less fun aspect of having to look after the animal or find a new home for it .
sometimes the easiest but most irresponsible way out is to leave the unwanted pet by the side of the motorway . but there are other consequences which have to be considered by those who have accepted the responsibility of bringing a pet into the family at christmas .
parents should be aware that an unscrupulous and criminal element has developed a market for puppy trafficking ; an enterprise which cares little for the welfare of the animal . demand for cheap pedigrees fuels trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedigree dogs are in demand a sharp increase in puppy-boot sales on the borders of germany and austria and discount pets available via the internet has authorities and activists up in arms .
the fear is that , with the demand for cheap but pedigree dogs on the increase , dogs are being bred for the christmas market not by experienced breeders but in dog-factories in eastern europe . " dogs are bred under circumstances unimaginable to any serious breeder , " katja wolf from austria 's cynology association told dpa .
" the dealers regard the animals just as merchandise .
it is dirty and the animals contract all sorts of illnesses .
if a bitch can not have any more offspring or there are complications , they are simply killed . " as many as 30 puppies at a time are ferried across the border in car boots by the dog-mafia to be sold in the parking lots of shopping centers , often for one-tenth of the price charged by registered breeders , officials believe . " you can get a golden retriever puppy for about 150 euros , normally a golden would set you back 1,500 or 2,000 , " wolf said . these young animals are often very ill and suffer greatly due to early separation from their mothers , long transport and poor keeping .
those which are not bought face being killed by the dealers . " the dog is only worthwhile for them as long as it is small and cute - and that lasts only a few weeks after birth , " wolf said . amended laws offset by open borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puppies should come with vaccinations from breeders animal rights ' activists estimate that around 30 carloads of illegal puppies without papers and the eu-wide mandatory vaccinations and microchips reach austria alone every day , a number which is expected to increase now that the schengen border controls have been lifted in many eastern european countries . austria has reacted by amending its animal protection legislation in mid-december , banning the sale of animals in public places without prior authorization from january 2008 , but disillusioned campaigners fear the law will not be enough . as well as the usual advice of sleeping on the decision to buy a dog for christmas , animal welfare groups are now advising parents to buy from a registered breeder or adopt an animal from a shelter to avoid fuelling the illegal trade . parents are also advised to make sure animals are vaccinated and microchipped while potential dog owners should visit the litter several times to get a proper impression of their prospective pet .
the bitch and the pups should show friendly behavior and look healthy and clean .
puppies should be at least eight weeks old before they are separated from their mothers . activists say that the dealers should take only part of the blame .

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .
the general view in germany is that merkel has placed too high a premium on foreign policy , putting domestic politics on the back burner .
the chancellor 's constant jet-setting around the world to meet with international leaders prompted a telling cartoon in the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel : bush , reclining in an armchair on his crawford ranch asks merkel , " well then , how was your trip to germany ? "
but some question whether the chancellor has really achieved all that much on the international stage .
" she -lrb- merkel -rrb- has presented no foreign policy initiatives of her own , no bold plans , " daily berliner zeitung wrote recently . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finally , after considering all the consequences of pet ownership , you relent .
are you a responsible parent ?
that now depends on who you buy the dog from . it is unlikely that the excited young recipient of a cute and cuddly christmas puppy will ask where the little bundle of festive joy came from and whether it was treated humanely on its way to the stocking .
these , however , are the exact questions parents should be asking if they are considering buying an animal as a present . the common pitfalls of giving pets at christmas are well known : the initial excitement wears off quickly for the recipient , leaving the parents to deal with the less fun aspect of having to look after the animal or find a new home for it .
sometimes the easiest but most irresponsible way out is to leave the unwanted pet by the side of the motorway . but there are other consequences which have to be considered by those who have accepted the responsibility of bringing a pet into the family at christmas .
parents should be aware that an unscrupulous and criminal element has developed a market for puppy trafficking ; an enterprise which cares little for the welfare of the animal . demand for cheap pedigrees fuels trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedigree dogs are in demand a sharp increase in puppy-boot sales on the borders of germany and austria and discount pets available via the internet has authorities and activists up in arms .
the fear is that , with the demand for cheap but pedigree dogs on the increase , dogs are being bred for the christmas market not by experienced breeders but in dog-factories in eastern europe . " dogs are bred under circumstances unimaginable to any serious breeder , " katja wolf from austria 's cynology association told dpa .
" the dealers regard the animals just as merchandise .
it is dirty and the animals contract all sorts of illnesses .
if a bitch can not have any more offspring or there are complications , they are simply killed . " as many as 30 puppies at a time are ferried across the border in car boots by the dog-mafia to be sold in the parking lots of shopping centers , often for one-tenth of the price charged by registered breeders , officials believe . " you can get a golden retriever puppy for about 150 euros , normally a golden would set you back 1,500 or 2,000 , " wolf said . these young animals are often very ill and suffer greatly due to early separation from their mothers , long transport and poor keeping .
those which are not bought face being killed by the dealers . " the dog is only worthwhile for them as long as it is small and cute - and that lasts only a few weeks after birth , " wolf said . amended laws offset by open borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puppies should come with vaccinations from breeders animal rights ' activists estimate that around 30 carloads of illegal puppies without papers and the eu-wide mandatory vaccinations and microchips reach austria alone every day , a number which is expected to increase now that the schengen border controls have been lifted in many eastern european countries . austria has reacted by amending its animal protection legislation in mid-december , banning the sale of animals in public places without prior authorization from january 2008 , but disillusioned campaigners fear the law will not be enough . as well as the usual advice of sleeping on the decision to buy a dog for christmas , animal welfare groups are now advising parents to buy from a registered breeder or adopt an animal from a shelter to avoid fuelling the illegal trade . parents are also advised to make sure animals are vaccinated and microchipped while potential dog owners should visit the litter several times to get a proper impression of their prospective pet .
the bitch and the pups should show friendly behavior and look healthy and clean .
puppies should be at least eight weeks old before they are separated from their mothers . activists say that the dealers should take only part of the blame .
the illegal trade is a buyers ' market that would not exist if people were not willing to buy from unregistered and clearly illegal sources . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it ’ s usually a celebration of a return to form of one of the world ’ s most renowned film industries . as befitting one of the birthplaces of cinema , germany enjoys a position of great standing in the world of film .
after all , max skladanowsky presented the first " living pictures " in berlin on nov .
1 , 1895 , beating france 's lumiere brothers to the honor by a month .
as a result of germany 's long association with the moving image , the country today possesses a huge number of archived film rolls , a heritage lovingly cared for by the federal film archives , which operates out of berlin and six other cities .
all in all , germany has in storage around 150,000 movies on 1 million rolls of film .
the berlin department is the home of the original skladanowsky film , which is stored along with many other historical works in what is one of the most comprehensive film archives in the world , documenting more than 100 years of movie history .
reflecting german cultural tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f.w. murnau 's " nosferatu " is a classic vampire film since the federal film archives were established in the 1950s , this venerable institution has acquired and catalogued a vast collection of films of all genres , digitally restoring a portion of them .
" we seek a wide variety of films , refusing to restrict ourselves purely to top cultural and famous feature productions , " karl griep , a departmental head at the archives office in berlin explained in an interview with dpa .
" this means our collection is comprehensive and reflects the society , fashion and cultural tastes of germany at different periods , from the silent movie era onwards , through the weimar and nazi periods to the present time , " he said .
one of the most prestigious periods in german film is catalogued at the berlin facility .
when a production company called ufa -lrb- later defa -rrb- in 1921 gained control of the babelsberg studios , south of berlin , a legendary era in film-making and film history began in germany .
a collection of classics among films made there were " the cabinet of dr. caligari , " " nosferatu , " the fritz lang classic " testament to dr. mabuse " and the 1930-made " blue angel , " starring marlene dietrich .
all these are stored with pride by the federal archives .
this shimmering cinematic bubble , however , burst with the nazis ' rise to power .
ufa was quickly turned into a propaganda factory by hitler 's close associate and minister joseph goebbels .
the studio 's mission was perverted into churning out anti-semitic and rabble-rousing films like “ hitlerjunge quex ” to motivate germans to support the war .
the nazi period in german history and the wochenschau films made during that time form an inevitable part of the federal archives .
the archives ' extensive collection and thorough historical chronology attracts visitors from many parts of the world every month .
some are movie-makers , others film researchers , historians or television program planners , eager to view or loan the available material .
post-war plundering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz lang 's " testament to dr. mabuse " is one of the protected films " the japanese are strong users of our archives and frequent visitors to our access rooms , " griep said .
" so are film representatives from scandinavia and other european countries , but not russia .
they keep the material they seized in 1945 … sometimes my impression is that that they do n't know themselves precisely what it is they have of ours anymore . ”
griep admitted that there was a degree of confusion over the ownership and place of origin of many of the disputed russian films , some of which were originally german before being translated into russian by the soviet union 's cultural authorities and then translated back with no record of the film 's original titles .
he believes that at least 100 rare german films had been lost in this way .
literally explosive in addition to housing some of the most precious examples of german film-making , the berlin premises also host germany 's largest nitrate-film storage facility , which is equipped with a staff of 80 archivists , restorers , technicians , historians and photo specialists .
five of the staff are engineers , experts in electronics and chemistry .
considerable care is taken there , due to the explosive nature of cellulose nitrate - the plastic which was commonly used for film-based photographic materials up to the 1950s .
strict fire regulations are in force , and technical devices deployed to save all sources of heating .
large outside earth safety mounds face sensitive parts of the facility , so that if explosions occur the blasts can be cushioned .
considering what treasures are held in the nearby archives , there is no such thing as being overcautious at the federal film archives . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .
the general view in germany is that merkel has placed too high a premium on foreign policy , putting domestic politics on the back burner .

finally , after considering all the consequences of pet ownership , you relent .
are you a responsible parent ?
that now depends on who you buy the dog from . it is unlikely that the excited young recipient of a cute and cuddly christmas puppy will ask where the little bundle of festive joy came from and whether it was treated humanely on its way to the stocking .
these , however , are the exact questions parents should be asking if they are considering buying an animal as a present . the common pitfalls of giving pets at christmas are well known : the initial excitement wears off quickly for the recipient , leaving the parents to deal with the less fun aspect of having to look after the animal or find a new home for it .
sometimes the easiest but most irresponsible way out is to leave the unwanted pet by the side of the motorway . but there are other consequences which have to be considered by those who have accepted the responsibility of bringing a pet into the family at christmas .
parents should be aware that an unscrupulous and criminal element has developed a market for puppy trafficking ; an enterprise which cares little for the welfare of the animal . demand for cheap pedigrees fuels trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedigree dogs are in demand a sharp increase in puppy-boot sales on the borders of germany and austria and discount pets available via the internet has authorities and activists up in arms .
the fear is that , with the demand for cheap but pedigree dogs on the increase , dogs are being bred for the christmas market not by experienced breeders but in dog-factories in eastern europe . " dogs are bred under circumstances unimaginable to any serious breeder , " katja wolf from austria 's cynology association told dpa .
" the dealers regard the animals just as merchandise .
it is dirty and the animals contract all sorts of illnesses .
if a bitch can not have any more offspring or there are complications , they are simply killed . " as many as 30 puppies at a time are ferried across the border in car boots by the dog-mafia to be sold in the parking lots of shopping centers , often for one-tenth of the price charged by registered breeders , officials believe . " you can get a golden retriever puppy for about 150 euros , normally a golden would set you back 1,500 or 2,000 , " wolf said . these young animals are often very ill and suffer greatly due to early separation from their mothers , long transport and poor keeping .
those which are not bought face being killed by the dealers . " the dog is only worthwhile for them as long as it is small and cute - and that lasts only a few weeks after birth , " wolf said . amended laws offset by open borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puppies should come with vaccinations from breeders animal rights ' activists estimate that around 30 carloads of illegal puppies without papers and the eu-wide mandatory vaccinations and microchips reach austria alone every day , a number which is expected to increase now that the schengen border controls have been lifted in many eastern european countries . austria has reacted by amending its animal protection legislation in mid-december , banning the sale of animals in public places without prior authorization from january 2008 , but disillusioned campaigners fear the law will not be enough . as well as the usual advice of sleeping on the decision to buy a dog for christmas , animal welfare groups are now advising parents to buy from a registered breeder or adopt an animal from a shelter to avoid fuelling the illegal trade . parents are also advised to make sure animals are vaccinated and microchipped while potential dog owners should visit the litter several times to get a proper impression of their prospective pet .
the bitch and the pups should show friendly behavior and look healthy and clean .
puppies should be at least eight weeks old before they are separated from their mothers . activists say that the dealers should take only part of the blame .

it ’ s usually a celebration of a return to form of one of the world ’ s most renowned film industries . as befitting one of the birthplaces of cinema , germany enjoys a position of great standing in the world of film .
after all , max skladanowsky presented the first " living pictures " in berlin on nov .
1 , 1895 , beating france 's lumiere brothers to the honor by a month .
as a result of germany 's long association with the moving image , the country today possesses a huge number of archived film rolls , a heritage lovingly cared for by the federal film archives , which operates out of berlin and six other cities .
all in all , germany has in storage around 150,000 movies on 1 million rolls of film .
the berlin department is the home of the original skladanowsky film , which is stored along with many other historical works in what is one of the most comprehensive film archives in the world , documenting more than 100 years of movie history .

it ’ s usually a celebration of a return to form of one of the world ’ s most renowned film industries . as befitting one of the birthplaces of cinema , germany enjoys a position of great standing in the world of film .
after all , max skladanowsky presented the first " living pictures " in berlin on nov .

as a result of germany 's long association with the moving image , the country today possesses a huge number of archived film rolls , a heritage lovingly cared for by the federal film archives , which operates out of berlin and six other cities .
all in all , germany has in storage around 150,000 movies on 1 million rolls of film .
the berlin department is the home of the original skladanowsky film , which is stored along with many other historical works in what is one of the most comprehensive film archives in the world , documenting more than 100 years of movie history .

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .
the general view in germany is that merkel has placed too high a premium on foreign policy , putting domestic politics on the back burner .
the chancellor 's constant jet-setting around the world to meet with international leaders prompted a telling cartoon in the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel : bush , reclining in an armchair on his crawford ranch asks merkel , " well then , how was your trip to germany ? "
but some question whether the chancellor has really achieved all that much on the international stage .

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .

the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .
the general view in germany is that merkel has placed too high a premium on foreign policy , putting domestic politics on the back burner .

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .

all in all , germany has in storage around 150,000 movies on 1 million rolls of film .
the berlin department is the home of the original skladanowsky film , which is stored along with many other historical works in what is one of the most comprehensive film archives in the world , documenting more than 100 years of movie history .

" we seek a wide variety of films , refusing to restrict ourselves purely to top cultural and famous feature productions , " karl griep , a departmental head at the archives office in berlin explained in an interview with dpa .
" this means our collection is comprehensive and reflects the society , fashion and cultural tastes of germany at different periods , from the silent movie era onwards , through the weimar and nazi periods to the present time , " he said .
one of the most prestigious periods in german film is catalogued at the berlin facility .
when a production company called ufa -lrb- later defa -rrb- in 1921 gained control of the babelsberg studios , south of berlin , a legendary era in film-making and film history began in germany .

ufa was quickly turned into a propaganda factory by hitler 's close associate and minister joseph goebbels .
the studio 's mission was perverted into churning out anti-semitic and rabble-rousing films like “ hitlerjunge quex ” to motivate germans to support the war .
the nazi period in german history and the wochenschau films made during that time form an inevitable part of the federal archives .

they keep the material they seized in 1945 … sometimes my impression is that that they do n't know themselves precisely what it is they have of ours anymore . ”
griep admitted that there was a degree of confusion over the ownership and place of origin of many of the disputed russian films , some of which were originally german before being translated into russian by the soviet union 's cultural authorities and then translated back with no record of the film 's original titles .

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .
the general view in germany is that merkel has placed too high a premium on foreign policy , putting domestic politics on the back burner .
the chancellor 's constant jet-setting around the world to meet with international leaders prompted a telling cartoon in the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel : bush , reclining in an armchair on his crawford ranch asks merkel , " well then , how was your trip to germany ? "
but some question whether the chancellor has really achieved all that much on the international stage .
" she -lrb- merkel -rrb- has presented no foreign policy initiatives of her own , no bold plans , " daily berliner zeitung wrote recently . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it ’ s usually a celebration of a return to form of one of the world ’ s most renowned film industries . as befitting one of the birthplaces of cinema , germany enjoys a position of great standing in the world of film .
after all , max skladanowsky presented the first " living pictures " in berlin on nov .

as a result of germany 's long association with the moving image , the country today possesses a huge number of archived film rolls , a heritage lovingly cared for by the federal film archives , which operates out of berlin and six other cities .
all in all , germany has in storage around 150,000 movies on 1 million rolls of film .
the berlin department is the home of the original skladanowsky film , which is stored along with many other historical works in what is one of the most comprehensive film archives in the world , documenting more than 100 years of movie history .
reflecting german cultural tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f.w. murnau 's " nosferatu " is a classic vampire film since the federal film archives were established in the 1950s , this venerable institution has acquired and catalogued a vast collection of films of all genres , digitally restoring a portion of them .
" we seek a wide variety of films , refusing to restrict ourselves purely to top cultural and famous feature productions , " karl griep , a departmental head at the archives office in berlin explained in an interview with dpa .
" this means our collection is comprehensive and reflects the society , fashion and cultural tastes of germany at different periods , from the silent movie era onwards , through the weimar and nazi periods to the present time , " he said .
one of the most prestigious periods in german film is catalogued at the berlin facility .
when a production company called ufa -lrb- later defa -rrb- in 1921 gained control of the babelsberg studios , south of berlin , a legendary era in film-making and film history began in germany .
a collection of classics among films made there were " the cabinet of dr. caligari , " " nosferatu , " the fritz lang classic " testament to dr. mabuse " and the 1930-made " blue angel , " starring marlene dietrich .
all these are stored with pride by the federal archives .
this shimmering cinematic bubble , however , burst with the nazis ' rise to power .
ufa was quickly turned into a propaganda factory by hitler 's close associate and minister joseph goebbels .
the studio 's mission was perverted into churning out anti-semitic and rabble-rousing films like “ hitlerjunge quex ” to motivate germans to support the war .
the nazi period in german history and the wochenschau films made during that time form an inevitable part of the federal archives .
the archives ' extensive collection and thorough historical chronology attracts visitors from many parts of the world every month .

" so are film representatives from scandinavia and other european countries , but not russia .
they keep the material they seized in 1945 … sometimes my impression is that that they do n't know themselves precisely what it is they have of ours anymore . ”
griep admitted that there was a degree of confusion over the ownership and place of origin of many of the disputed russian films , some of which were originally german before being translated into russian by the soviet union 's cultural authorities and then translated back with no record of the film 's original titles .
he believes that at least 100 rare german films had been lost in this way .

considerable care is taken there , due to the explosive nature of cellulose nitrate - the plastic which was commonly used for film-based photographic materials up to the 1950s .

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .
the general view in germany is that merkel has placed too high a premium on foreign policy , putting domestic politics on the back burner .
the chancellor 's constant jet-setting around the world to meet with international leaders prompted a telling cartoon in the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel : bush , reclining in an armchair on his crawford ranch asks merkel , " well then , how was your trip to germany ? "
but some question whether the chancellor has really achieved all that much on the international stage .

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .
the general view in germany is that merkel has placed too high a premium on foreign policy , putting domestic politics on the back burner .

finally , after considering all the consequences of pet ownership , you relent .
are you a responsible parent ?
that now depends on who you buy the dog from . it is unlikely that the excited young recipient of a cute and cuddly christmas puppy will ask where the little bundle of festive joy came from and whether it was treated humanely on its way to the stocking .
these , however , are the exact questions parents should be asking if they are considering buying an animal as a present . the common pitfalls of giving pets at christmas are well known : the initial excitement wears off quickly for the recipient , leaving the parents to deal with the less fun aspect of having to look after the animal or find a new home for it .
sometimes the easiest but most irresponsible way out is to leave the unwanted pet by the side of the motorway . but there are other consequences which have to be considered by those who have accepted the responsibility of bringing a pet into the family at christmas .
parents should be aware that an unscrupulous and criminal element has developed a market for puppy trafficking ; an enterprise which cares little for the welfare of the animal . demand for cheap pedigrees fuels trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedigree dogs are in demand a sharp increase in puppy-boot sales on the borders of germany and austria and discount pets available via the internet has authorities and activists up in arms .
the fear is that , with the demand for cheap but pedigree dogs on the increase , dogs are being bred for the christmas market not by experienced breeders but in dog-factories in eastern europe . " dogs are bred under circumstances unimaginable to any serious breeder , " katja wolf from austria 's cynology association told dpa .
" the dealers regard the animals just as merchandise .
it is dirty and the animals contract all sorts of illnesses .
if a bitch can not have any more offspring or there are complications , they are simply killed . " as many as 30 puppies at a time are ferried across the border in car boots by the dog-mafia to be sold in the parking lots of shopping centers , often for one-tenth of the price charged by registered breeders , officials believe . " you can get a golden retriever puppy for about 150 euros , normally a golden would set you back 1,500 or 2,000 , " wolf said . these young animals are often very ill and suffer greatly due to early separation from their mothers , long transport and poor keeping .
those which are not bought face being killed by the dealers . " the dog is only worthwhile for them as long as it is small and cute - and that lasts only a few weeks after birth , " wolf said . amended laws offset by open borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puppies should come with vaccinations from breeders animal rights ' activists estimate that around 30 carloads of illegal puppies without papers and the eu-wide mandatory vaccinations and microchips reach austria alone every day , a number which is expected to increase now that the schengen border controls have been lifted in many eastern european countries . austria has reacted by amending its animal protection legislation in mid-december , banning the sale of animals in public places without prior authorization from january 2008 , but disillusioned campaigners fear the law will not be enough . as well as the usual advice of sleeping on the decision to buy a dog for christmas , animal welfare groups are now advising parents to buy from a registered breeder or adopt an animal from a shelter to avoid fuelling the illegal trade . parents are also advised to make sure animals are vaccinated and microchipped while potential dog owners should visit the litter several times to get a proper impression of their prospective pet .
the bitch and the pups should show friendly behavior and look healthy and clean .
puppies should be at least eight weeks old before they are separated from their mothers . activists say that the dealers should take only part of the blame .
the illegal trade is a buyers ' market that would not exist if people were not willing to buy from unregistered and clearly illegal sources . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .
the general view in germany is that merkel has placed too high a premium on foreign policy , putting domestic politics on the back burner .
the chancellor 's constant jet-setting around the world to meet with international leaders prompted a telling cartoon in the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel : bush , reclining in an armchair on his crawford ranch asks merkel , " well then , how was your trip to germany ? "
but some question whether the chancellor has really achieved all that much on the international stage .

finally , after considering all the consequences of pet ownership , you relent .
are you a responsible parent ?
that now depends on who you buy the dog from . it is unlikely that the excited young recipient of a cute and cuddly christmas puppy will ask where the little bundle of festive joy came from and whether it was treated humanely on its way to the stocking .
these , however , are the exact questions parents should be asking if they are considering buying an animal as a present . the common pitfalls of giving pets at christmas are well known : the initial excitement wears off quickly for the recipient , leaving the parents to deal with the less fun aspect of having to look after the animal or find a new home for it .
sometimes the easiest but most irresponsible way out is to leave the unwanted pet by the side of the motorway . but there are other consequences which have to be considered by those who have accepted the responsibility of bringing a pet into the family at christmas .
parents should be aware that an unscrupulous and criminal element has developed a market for puppy trafficking ; an enterprise which cares little for the welfare of the animal . demand for cheap pedigrees fuels trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedigree dogs are in demand a sharp increase in puppy-boot sales on the borders of germany and austria and discount pets available via the internet has authorities and activists up in arms .
the fear is that , with the demand for cheap but pedigree dogs on the increase , dogs are being bred for the christmas market not by experienced breeders but in dog-factories in eastern europe . " dogs are bred under circumstances unimaginable to any serious breeder , " katja wolf from austria 's cynology association told dpa .
" the dealers regard the animals just as merchandise .
it is dirty and the animals contract all sorts of illnesses .
if a bitch can not have any more offspring or there are complications , they are simply killed . " as many as 30 puppies at a time are ferried across the border in car boots by the dog-mafia to be sold in the parking lots of shopping centers , often for one-tenth of the price charged by registered breeders , officials believe . " you can get a golden retriever puppy for about 150 euros , normally a golden would set you back 1,500 or 2,000 , " wolf said . these young animals are often very ill and suffer greatly due to early separation from their mothers , long transport and poor keeping .
those which are not bought face being killed by the dealers . " the dog is only worthwhile for them as long as it is small and cute - and that lasts only a few weeks after birth , " wolf said . amended laws offset by open borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puppies should come with vaccinations from breeders animal rights ' activists estimate that around 30 carloads of illegal puppies without papers and the eu-wide mandatory vaccinations and microchips reach austria alone every day , a number which is expected to increase now that the schengen border controls have been lifted in many eastern european countries . austria has reacted by amending its animal protection legislation in mid-december , banning the sale of animals in public places without prior authorization from january 2008 , but disillusioned campaigners fear the law will not be enough . as well as the usual advice of sleeping on the decision to buy a dog for christmas , animal welfare groups are now advising parents to buy from a registered breeder or adopt an animal from a shelter to avoid fuelling the illegal trade . parents are also advised to make sure animals are vaccinated and microchipped while potential dog owners should visit the litter several times to get a proper impression of their prospective pet .
the bitch and the pups should show friendly behavior and look healthy and clean .
puppies should be at least eight weeks old before they are separated from their mothers . activists say that the dealers should take only part of the blame .
the illegal trade is a buyers ' market that would not exist if people were not willing to buy from unregistered and clearly illegal sources . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .
the general view in germany is that merkel has placed too high a premium on foreign policy , putting domestic politics on the back burner .
the chancellor 's constant jet-setting around the world to meet with international leaders prompted a telling cartoon in the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel : bush , reclining in an armchair on his crawford ranch asks merkel , " well then , how was your trip to germany ? "
but some question whether the chancellor has really achieved all that much on the international stage .
" she -lrb- merkel -rrb- has presented no foreign policy initiatives of her own , no bold plans , " daily berliner zeitung wrote recently . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .
the general view in germany is that merkel has placed too high a premium on foreign policy , putting domestic politics on the back burner .
the chancellor 's constant jet-setting around the world to meet with international leaders prompted a telling cartoon in the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel : bush , reclining in an armchair on his crawford ranch asks merkel , " well then , how was your trip to germany ? "

finally , after considering all the consequences of pet ownership , you relent .
are you a responsible parent ?
that now depends on who you buy the dog from . it is unlikely that the excited young recipient of a cute and cuddly christmas puppy will ask where the little bundle of festive joy came from and whether it was treated humanely on its way to the stocking .
these , however , are the exact questions parents should be asking if they are considering buying an animal as a present . the common pitfalls of giving pets at christmas are well known : the initial excitement wears off quickly for the recipient , leaving the parents to deal with the less fun aspect of having to look after the animal or find a new home for it .
sometimes the easiest but most irresponsible way out is to leave the unwanted pet by the side of the motorway . but there are other consequences which have to be considered by those who have accepted the responsibility of bringing a pet into the family at christmas .
parents should be aware that an unscrupulous and criminal element has developed a market for puppy trafficking ; an enterprise which cares little for the welfare of the animal . demand for cheap pedigrees fuels trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedigree dogs are in demand a sharp increase in puppy-boot sales on the borders of germany and austria and discount pets available via the internet has authorities and activists up in arms .
the fear is that , with the demand for cheap but pedigree dogs on the increase , dogs are being bred for the christmas market not by experienced breeders but in dog-factories in eastern europe . " dogs are bred under circumstances unimaginable to any serious breeder , " katja wolf from austria 's cynology association told dpa .
" the dealers regard the animals just as merchandise .
it is dirty and the animals contract all sorts of illnesses .
if a bitch can not have any more offspring or there are complications , they are simply killed . " as many as 30 puppies at a time are ferried across the border in car boots by the dog-mafia to be sold in the parking lots of shopping centers , often for one-tenth of the price charged by registered breeders , officials believe . " you can get a golden retriever puppy for about 150 euros , normally a golden would set you back 1,500 or 2,000 , " wolf said . these young animals are often very ill and suffer greatly due to early separation from their mothers , long transport and poor keeping .
those which are not bought face being killed by the dealers . " the dog is only worthwhile for them as long as it is small and cute - and that lasts only a few weeks after birth , " wolf said . amended laws offset by open borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puppies should come with vaccinations from breeders animal rights ' activists estimate that around 30 carloads of illegal puppies without papers and the eu-wide mandatory vaccinations and microchips reach austria alone every day , a number which is expected to increase now that the schengen border controls have been lifted in many eastern european countries . austria has reacted by amending its animal protection legislation in mid-december , banning the sale of animals in public places without prior authorization from january 2008 , but disillusioned campaigners fear the law will not be enough . as well as the usual advice of sleeping on the decision to buy a dog for christmas , animal welfare groups are now advising parents to buy from a registered breeder or adopt an animal from a shelter to avoid fuelling the illegal trade . parents are also advised to make sure animals are vaccinated and microchipped while potential dog owners should visit the litter several times to get a proper impression of their prospective pet .
the bitch and the pups should show friendly behavior and look healthy and clean .
puppies should be at least eight weeks old before they are separated from their mothers . activists say that the dealers should take only part of the blame .
the illegal trade is a buyers ' market that would not exist if people were not willing to buy from unregistered and clearly illegal sources . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all her foreign policy efforts were equally successful . europe took center stage in germany 's foreign policy in the first half of 2007 .
as head of the rotating six-month eu presidency , german chancellor angela merkel 's priority was to revive talks on the derailed eu constitution treaty as a way of reforming and streamlining the 27-member bloc .
the treaty was rejected by french and dutch voters in separate referendums , triggering a major crisis in the eu .
" we have set a motto for our presidency : europe works together , " merkel said at the time .
" i can also say : europe can only work together . "
tough and knowledgeable presiding over a deeply divided summit of fellow leaders in march , merkel showed a first glimpse of her formidable diplomatic skills when she managed to sign them up to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been showered with praise from european leaders the german leader was showered with praise from her european counterparts for her personal and inclusive style of leadership and her deep command of the issues under discussion .
two weeks later in berlin , merkel had her european colleagues pledge to resolve the eu 's constitutional crisis by 2009 .
at a crucial summit in june , marked by marathon meetings and fraught negotiations - in particular with poland - eu leaders finally clinched a treaty deal .
it dropped the word " constitution , " and included a new majority voting system .
the deal chalked up another triumph for merkel .
" merkel has shown that she can be very tough , that she does n't shy away from being open and harsh and that she can manage to push through a result with all diplomatic means , " jan techau , head of the eu policy program at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle .
g8 summit a mixed success fresh off the victorious eu summit , merkel moved to her next big foreign policy test - heading the group of eight summit and getting the leaders of the world 's richest countries to slash global emissions , raise aid to africa and pledge more money to fight aids and malaria .
leaders of the developing world were also invited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit was overshadowed by demonstrations the summit held in heiligendamm on germany 's baltic sea coast was overshadowed by large anti-globalization protests and strong security measures .
though merkel hailed the summit as a success , critics attacked the event for failing to get the us on board and accept binding commitments to cut co2 emissions .
germany 's press , which until that point had been full of praise for their first female chancellor , was cool in their assessment .
" measured in terms of the high-flying expectations she herself whipped up in recent weeks , angela merkel failed on climate change at the g-8 summit , " germany 's financial times deutschland said .
" this was n't a breakthrough to save the world climate , it was a makeshift deal to save the summit 's reputation , " the left-wing tageszeitung wrote . balancing human rights and diplomacy while merkel 's championing of green issues and her emphasis on the need to tackle climate change - a stance evident during her stewardship of the eu and g8 - has earned her praise , her foreign policy record is not perfect .
her failure , in particular , to improve relations with russia has upset some of her allies in berlin who note that germany draws around a third of its crude oil and gas needs from its powerful eastern neighbor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much chemistry there - merkel with putin " merkel has tried personally to solve problems with russia but there 's no chemistry with putin , " said techau .
" you can see it on the photographs when they meet : they are n't with each other , but next to each other . "
the german leader 's firm and public stand on human rights , even if it strains diplomatic ties and jeopardizes business links , has earned her admiration from human rights groups .
she has pressed russia , china and most recently zimbabwe on questions of human rights .
" foreign policy has to bring together germany 's values and interests , " merkel said after a furious reaction from beijing following her meeting with tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama . " it 's not about values or business . "
her forthright approach , however , has worried german businesses and prompted criticism .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat and protégé of former chancellor schröder , has accused merkel of " shop window politics " in her dealings with russia and china .
too strong a focus on foreign policy by contrast , merkel is credited with improving ties with the us , which had soured under schröder . though she enjoys a warm rapport with us president bush , merkel 's reluctance to pull weight in afghanistan and send in troops to support the us-led battle against insurgents remains a sticking point .
the general view in germany is that merkel has placed too high a premium on foreign policy , putting domestic politics on the back burner .
the chancellor 's constant jet-setting around the world to meet with international leaders prompted a telling cartoon in the berlin-based daily tagesspiegel : bush , reclining in an armchair on his crawford ranch asks merkel , " well then , how was your trip to germany ? "
but some question whether the chancellor has really achieved all that much on the international stage .
" she -lrb- merkel -rrb- has presented no foreign policy initiatives of her own , no bold plans , " daily berliner zeitung wrote recently . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the allowance is designed to help those caring for relatives for more than 35 hours a week , but the institute for public policy research says it can be hard to claim , with 43 % of those entitled to it - some 350,000 people - not receiving it .
the government said it was committed to helping carers .
the report proposed a new single benefit would replace carer 's allowance , income support , jobseeker 's allowance , and employment and support allowance .
' not fit ' claimants would have to fulfil certain conditions negotiated with their personal adviser .
in return they would be asked about their needs and motivation to work in the future and be offered personalised support .
carer 's allowance is paid at £ 48 a week - lower than benefits for other people who are out of work .
the ippr research found some 30 % of jobless people with caring responsibilities were in relative poverty , as were 7 % of those who combined care with employment .
kate stanley , ippr 's head of social policy , said : " carer 's allowance is not fit for modern families or a modern economy .
" if the government is to meet its target for full employment and people 's aspirations for caring for older and disabled people within families , carer 's allowance needs to go . "
the government said it was committed to helping carers and was reviewing how they were supported .
a department for work and pensions spokeswoman said : " we welcome this report as a useful contribution to the review but we are not persuaded that it is necessarily the right way to go .
" our next step will to be consider all the contributions to the debate . "

the allowance is designed to help those caring for relatives for more than 35 hours a week , but the institute for public policy research says it can be hard to claim , with 43 % of those entitled to it - some 350,000 people - not receiving it .
the government said it was committed to helping carers .
the report proposed a new single benefit would replace carer 's allowance , income support , jobseeker 's allowance , and employment and support allowance .
' not fit ' claimants would have to fulfil certain conditions negotiated with their personal adviser .
in return they would be asked about their needs and motivation to work in the future and be offered personalised support .
carer 's allowance is paid at £ 48 a week - lower than benefits for other people who are out of work .
the ippr research found some 30 % of jobless people with caring responsibilities were in relative poverty , as were 7 % of those who combined care with employment .
kate stanley , ippr 's head of social policy , said : " carer 's allowance is not fit for modern families or a modern economy .
" if the government is to meet its target for full employment and people 's aspirations for caring for older and disabled people within families , carer 's allowance needs to go . "
the government said it was committed to helping carers and was reviewing how they were supported .
a department for work and pensions spokeswoman said : " we welcome this report as a useful contribution to the review but we are not persuaded that it is necessarily the right way to go .

the allowance is designed to help those caring for relatives for more than 35 hours a week , but the institute for public policy research says it can be hard to claim , with 43 % of those entitled to it - some 350,000 people - not receiving it .
the government said it was committed to helping carers .
the report proposed a new single benefit would replace carer 's allowance , income support , jobseeker 's allowance , and employment and support allowance .
' not fit ' claimants would have to fulfil certain conditions negotiated with their personal adviser .
in return they would be asked about their needs and motivation to work in the future and be offered personalised support .
carer 's allowance is paid at £ 48 a week - lower than benefits for other people who are out of work .
the ippr research found some 30 % of jobless people with caring responsibilities were in relative poverty , as were 7 % of those who combined care with employment .
kate stanley , ippr 's head of social policy , said : " carer 's allowance is not fit for modern families or a modern economy .
" if the government is to meet its target for full employment and people 's aspirations for caring for older and disabled people within families , carer 's allowance needs to go . "
the government said it was committed to helping carers and was reviewing how they were supported .
a department for work and pensions spokeswoman said : " we welcome this report as a useful contribution to the review but we are not persuaded that it is necessarily the right way to go .
" our next step will to be consider all the contributions to the debate . "

samak sundaravej mr samak was a popular but controversial bangkok governor samak sundaravej leads the people power party -lrb- ppp -rrb- , which was formed by lawmakers from ousted prime minister thaksin shinawatra 's party , thai rak thai .
thai rak thai was dissolved by the constitutional court in may , for electoral violations , but mr thaksin 's allies soon resurfaced under the ppp banner .
the 72-year-old mr samak , well-known for his fiery temper and abrasive manner , served as deputy prime minister alongside mr thaksin in 1995 .
elected bangkok governor in 2000 , he was then accused of corruption charges linked to two city contracts .
he denies the charges but the case remains under investigation .
the veteran conservative has made no bones about the fact that he is running as mr thaksin 's proxy and that he plans to bring him back .
" the military wanted to get rid of his party .
they wanted not a single thing left over , " he told the french news agency afp .
" i think that is unfair .
so when he asked me -lrb- to run the party -rrb- , i said ' ok ' . "
mr samak has adopted mr thaksin 's populist platform and promised voters that he will work to improve the economy .
his political success comes despite long-standing allegations linking him to the suppression of a 1976 pro-democracy uprising , in which student demonstrators were killed .
he denies these claims .
abhisit vejjajiva the democrats , led by abhisit vejjajiva , are ppp 's main rivals forty-three year-old abhisit vejjajiva , who leads the democrat party , has a rare reputation in thailand for being a clean candidate .
articulate and photogenic , the oxford-educated former lecturer draws support from southern thailand and from middle-class voters .
but he has struggled to reach the poor rural thais that propelled mr thaksin to power .
the uk-born leader , who entered politics in 1992 , is promoting a 99-day plan that includes many of mr thaksin 's popular economic and social policies .
but he says that is not all his party has to offer .
" we would be a government that respects the law , that upholds the true principles of democracy , which allows the opposition to participate , " he said .
banharn silpa-archa chart thai leader banharn could find himself in a strong position banharn silpa-archa heads chart thai , the third-ranked party , according to opinion polls .
some analysts say chart thai could end up playing a key role in deciding the next government .
with both ppp and the democrats unlikely to gain a majority , 75-year-old mr banharn could find himself in a position of considerable influence as the coalition partner of choice .
he has not publicly indicated which party he might back , describing chart thai as a " friend to all " .
mr banharn commands considerable support in the central suphanburi province , which he has represented since 1976 .
he served as prime minister from mid-1995 until late 1996 , and his government was widely seen as having paved the way for the economic crisis of 1997 .
critics accuse him of corruption , but he denies these claims .

samak sundaravej samak sundaravej leads the people power party -lrb- ppp -rrb- , which was formed by lawmakers from ousted prime minister thaksin shinawatra 's party , thai rak thai .
thai rak thai was dissolved by the constitutional court in may , for electoral violations , but mr thaksin 's allies soon resurfaced under the ppp banner .
the 72-year-old mr samak , well-known for his fiery temper and abrasive manner , served as deputy prime minister alongside mr thaksin in 1995 .
elected bangkok governor in 2000 , he was then accused of corruption charges linked to two city contracts .
he denies the charges but the case remains under investigation .
the veteran conservative has made no bones about the fact that he is running as mr thaksin 's proxy and that he plans to bring him back .
" the military wanted to get rid of his party .
they wanted not a single thing left over , " he told the french news agency afp .
" i think that is unfair .
so when he asked me -lrb- to run the party -rrb- , i said ' ok ' . "
mr samak has adopted mr thaksin 's populist platform and promised voters that he will work to improve the economy .
his political success comes despite long-standing allegations linking him to the suppression of a 1976 pro-democracy uprising , in which student demonstrators were killed .
he denies these claims .
abhisit vejjajiva forty-three year-old abhisit vejjajiva , who leads the democrat party , has a rare reputation in thailand for being a clean candidate .
articulate and photogenic , the oxford-educated former lecturer draws support from southern thailand and from middle-class voters .
but he has struggled to reach the poor rural thais that propelled mr thaksin to power .
the uk-born leader , who entered politics in 1992 , is promoting a 99-day plan that includes many of mr thaksin 's popular economic and social policies .
but he says that is not all his party has to offer .
" we would be a government that respects the law , that upholds the true principles of democracy , which allows the opposition to participate , " he said .
banharn silpa-archa banharn silpa-archa heads chart thai , the third-ranked party , according to opinion polls .
some analysts say chart thai could end up playing a key role in deciding the next government .
with both ppp and the democrats unlikely to gain a majority , 75-year-old mr banharn could find himself in a position of considerable influence as the coalition partner of choice .
he has not publicly indicated which party he might back , describing chart thai as a " friend to all " .
mr banharn commands considerable support in the central suphanburi province , which he has represented since 1976 .
he served as prime minister from mid-1995 until late 1996 , and his government was widely seen as having paved the way for the economic crisis of 1997 .
critics accuse him of corruption , but he denies these claims .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- q & a : uzbek presidential election bbc news / asia-pacific graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- sunday , 23 december 2007 , 09:21 gmt q & a : uzbek presidential election uzbekistan is holding its presidential election , and islam karimov , who has led the country since before its independence from the soviet union , is widely expected to retain the presidency .
who is standing ?
president karimov is the main contender .
he was first elected for a five-year term in 1991 , but in 1995 this was extended until 2000 , by a referendum that his opponents and independent analysts criticised as rigged .
he won the 2000 election , which was again criticised as neither free nor fair , as well as a 2002 referendum to extend his term until 2007 .
under the constitution , a president is only allowed two terms , but while international observers say that if mr karimov is re-elected , he will be starting his third term , mr karimov himself insists it will only be his second .
there are three other candidates : asliddin rustamov of the people 's democratic party ; dilorom toshmuhammadova of the adolat social democratic party ; and akmal saidov .
all three are members of parliament .
is the election likely to be free and fair ?
no .
opposition parties are banned in uzbekistan , and the parties represented in parliament are all pro-government .
in order to run in the election , potential candidates have to be nominated by a registered party or an " initiative group " of at least 300 voters , and then gather at least 815,000 signatures -lrb- 5 % of the population -rrb- in support of their candidacy .
because opposition parties are not registered , and the authoritarian nature of the state discourages people from signing pro-opposition petitions , this effectively rules out any independent candidates .
in one example , human rights activist abdullo tojiboy ogli was nominated by the unregistered alliance of human rights defenders of uzbekistan , but the commission said he had failed to get the required number of signatures .
could anyone except mr karimov win ?
in theory there is no reason why one of the other registered candidates can not beat mr karimov , and they are currently receiving campaign slots in the state-run media .
however , their support for the government and the lack of transparency in previous elections suggest that president karimov will win a comfortable victory .
in the event of his not winning more than 50 % of the vote in the first ballot , mr karimov will have to face a run-off within 40 days against the second-ranking candidate .
are any independent observers ?
the organization for security and co-operation in europe has sent a 24-person mission .
a team spokesman said the " apparent limited nature of the competition " meant that it would not carry out comprehensive observation of election-day proceedings , but rather visit a number of polling stations on election day .
the executive committee of the commonwealth of independent states has sent a mission of 80 members , led by deputy chairman vladimir garkun .
mr garkun said the uzbek election law met " all international standards " .
bbc monitoring selects and translates news from radio , television , press , news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages .
it is based in caversham , uk , and has several bureaux abroad .
