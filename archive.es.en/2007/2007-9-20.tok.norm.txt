20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .
for something to be considered child pornography , it involves the sexual portrayal of a child - that is , according to german law , a person under age 14 .
the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .
they do n't know how they can manage from one day to the next .
and the child is then sold to sex criminals who film their acts and sometimes go on to sell these images .
are there certain areas within europe where the problems are greatest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international cooperation is crucial in identifying perpetrators and sexual exploitation victims no , there is no part of europe that is particularly more active than another .
everyone is equally affected by this .
do european countries and agencies work well together on this issue ? how can international cooperation be improved ?
in recent years , a number of different measures against child pornography were undertaken , and various alliances and groups were formed .
for example at interpol in lyon or europol in the hague .
also there is a tight connection between central german organizations , like the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , and their counterparts in london or paris .
and then , there are regular international conferences to discuss experiences and share information .
of course , it could all be improved upon .
but politicians are working on it , trying to harmonize certain things .
like the laws in various countries .
every country does n't apply the same laws to child sex offenses .
so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .
but now this has changed .
people recognize something must be done .
and i see that people are working very hard to protect children .
that 's what the goal of this work really is : to scare off potential child pornographers and protect children .
can individuals do anything to protect their children from becoming victims of internet related sex abuse ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in chat rooms can become prey for sex predators it is very important that parents and teachers learn how to use the media .
many teachers and parents just throw up their hands and say , " i do n't know how to use this ; you do it . "
they leave it up to the child to use the media .
so the children wind up in chat rooms where they think they are chatting with people of their own age .
but there are actually a lot of men there who are much older .
they claim to be young .
they make dates to meet , exchange phone numbers .
and then the date turns out to be a sexual assault .
teachers and parents really need to be aware of this .
there are too many people who still do n't know about it .
they should keep an eye on who their children know , who they are meeting , where and when . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.09.2007 internet home to most child sex crimes , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet porn peddlers increasingly push images of children ahead of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet , dw-world.de spoke to a german police investigator who used creative methods to crack a child pornography ring . on thursday , sept .
20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .
for something to be considered child pornography , it involves the sexual portrayal of a child - that is , according to german law , a person under age 14 .
the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .
they do n't know how they can manage from one day to the next .
and the child is then sold to sex criminals who film their acts and sometimes go on to sell these images .
are there certain areas within europe where the problems are greatest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international cooperation is crucial in identifying perpetrators and sexual exploitation victims no , there is no part of europe that is particularly more active than another .
everyone is equally affected by this .
do european countries and agencies work well together on this issue ? how can international cooperation be improved ?
in recent years , a number of different measures against child pornography were undertaken , and various alliances and groups were formed .
for example at interpol in lyon or europol in the hague .
also there is a tight connection between central german organizations , like the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , and their counterparts in london or paris .
and then , there are regular international conferences to discuss experiences and share information .
of course , it could all be improved upon .
but politicians are working on it , trying to harmonize certain things .
like the laws in various countries .
every country does n't apply the same laws to child sex offenses .
so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .
but now this has changed .
people recognize something must be done .
and i see that people are working very hard to protect children .
that 's what the goal of this work really is : to scare off potential child pornographers and protect children .
can individuals do anything to protect their children from becoming victims of internet related sex abuse ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in chat rooms can become prey for sex predators it is very important that parents and teachers learn how to use the media .
many teachers and parents just throw up their hands and say , " i do n't know how to use this ; you do it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.09.2007 internet home to most child sex crimes , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet porn peddlers increasingly push images of children ahead of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet , dw-world.de spoke to a german police investigator who used creative methods to crack a child pornography ring . on thursday , sept .
20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?

the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .

20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 20.09.2007 symphonic music may suffer under eu noise directive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come on , guys , i ca n't hear you !
when the eu introduced a directive five years ago aimed at reducing noise levels in the workplace , symphony orchestras were not covered by it .
starting next year , this will change .
will beethoven never sound the same ? " it ca n't work in symphony orchestras , " libor pesek , conductor of the prague symphony told ap news agency , referring to the eu noise directive .
" how could you apply it to gustav mahler , for instance , or richard strauss ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras may have to adjust to the new eu directive the thrust of the eu noise directive is aimed at protecting workers who are constantly exposed to high noise levels in places like construction sites or factories .
but that is not to say that classical music does n't have its victims .
a rare african okapi from the copenhagen zoo dropped dead in 1994 after opera singers exercised their joy of loud singing during open-air rehearsals in a nearby park .
" workplaces where workers are likely to be exposed to noise ... shall be marked with appropriate signs , " an excerpt from the eu directive reads .
" the areas in question shall also be delimited and access to them restricted . "
that may prove difficult with a symphony orchestra where noise is not simply an unwilling production side effect , but very much an essential part of the product .
considering that the maximum noise limit allowed by the eu is set at 85 decibels on an average work day , some fear that that the implementation of the noise directive could take all the fun out of fortissimos that decorate the music scores by tchaikovsky , stravinsky & co .
getting loud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some instruments are born more powerful than others trumpets are known to push out 110 decibels , tubas 110 and trombones 108 during peak moments of wagner 's operas .
even the violins - the instruments whose sweet , mellifluous sound usually accompanies the long-awaited declaration of love in a hollywood romantic comedy - can get pretty loud , registering 109 decibels .
which is why - at least in terms of their decibel levels - power drills sometimes sound like lullabies when compared to the force of a symphony orchestra .
alison reid wright , a noise expert who has worked with british orchestras , told ap that large ensembles are already readjusting their programs to conform with the directive .
" they would n't take a large noisy piece to a small venue , " she said .
" and some orchestras have been trying to balance the noise by offsetting a very powerful piece by less powerful pieces . "
too late ?
others , she said , might follow the example of an australian opera orchestra , which decided a few years ago to use " one set of musicians for the first half and another set for the second half " to protect their hearing .
exactly how the directive will be implemented remains to be see , but once it comes into force for the music and entertainment sectors on feb .
15 , 2008 .
if a noise abatement directive had existed in the 19th century , perhaps beethoven would n't have gone deaf .
for modern-day musicians , however , the initiative may come too late .
" we 're all deaf anyway , " pesek said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from tsunamis in asia , hurricanes in central and north america to earthquakes in pakistan , floods in india and famine in africa , natural disasters have become increasingly frequent and increasingly deadly in recent years .
seven of the 10 worst disasters of the last 20 years occurred between 2000 and 2006 .

the german government announced it would pay compensation to some 50,000 workers in nazi germany 's jewish ghettos who previously failed to qualify for payouts from a fund for former slave laborers . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said on wednesday , sept 19 , that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved a finance ministry plan to award one-off payments of 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,789 -rrb- to those who have not yet received compensation from the holocaust memorial fund .
" the payment agreed today is not compensation for being interned in ghettos ... it is a humanitarian gesture , " wilhelm told reporters in berlin , stressing that it was aimed at people who did not receive compensation from a separate settlement created in 2000 that had paid out a total of 4.4 billion euros to survivors of the nazis ' forced labor programs . with merkel eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible , the announcement comes after weeks of discussion between german finance ministry officials and israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafi eitan . germany allegedly wanted to pay some 700 euros per person less , but israel insisted the offer was too low . a drawn out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision will apply to some 50,000 ghetto survivors compensation for ghetto workers , whose wages would have been negligible , is one of the last outstanding compensation claims dating back to hitler 's third reich .
the issue has long been the subject of negotiations with the new york-based jewish claims conference , which obtains compensation for holocaust survivors .
in germany , the setting up of the fund to compensate slave laborers was overshadowed by legal wrangling about contributions from companies which profited from the nazis ' labor policies during the third reich .
former slave laborers and their surviving relatives in over 100 countries received payouts from that fund , whose administrators announced in july that they had completed their task .
forgotten ghetto survivors in 2002 , the german parliament passed a law to grant the ghetto survivors a small pension , but the plan failed due to bureaucratic difficulties processing the claims .
the finance ministry said the government estimated there were still around 50,000 people eligible to claim the payment .

when the eu introduced a directive five years ago aimed at reducing noise levels in the workplace , symphony orchestras were not covered by it .
starting next year , this will change .
will beethoven never sound the same ? " it ca n't work in symphony orchestras , " libor pesek , conductor of the prague symphony told ap news agency , referring to the eu noise directive .
" how could you apply it to gustav mahler , for instance , or richard strauss ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras may have to adjust to the new eu directive the thrust of the eu noise directive is aimed at protecting workers who are constantly exposed to high noise levels in places like construction sites or factories .
but that is not to say that classical music does n't have its victims .
a rare african okapi from the copenhagen zoo dropped dead in 1994 after opera singers exercised their joy of loud singing during open-air rehearsals in a nearby park .
" workplaces where workers are likely to be exposed to noise ... shall be marked with appropriate signs , " an excerpt from the eu directive reads .
" the areas in question shall also be delimited and access to them restricted . "
that may prove difficult with a symphony orchestra where noise is not simply an unwilling production side effect , but very much an essential part of the product .
considering that the maximum noise limit allowed by the eu is set at 85 decibels on an average work day , some fear that that the implementation of the noise directive could take all the fun out of fortissimos that decorate the music scores by tchaikovsky , stravinsky & co .
getting loud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some instruments are born more powerful than others trumpets are known to push out 110 decibels , tubas 110 and trombones 108 during peak moments of wagner 's operas .
even the violins - the instruments whose sweet , mellifluous sound usually accompanies the long-awaited declaration of love in a hollywood romantic comedy - can get pretty loud , registering 109 decibels .
which is why - at least in terms of their decibel levels - power drills sometimes sound like lullabies when compared to the force of a symphony orchestra .
alison reid wright , a noise expert who has worked with british orchestras , told ap that large ensembles are already readjusting their programs to conform with the directive .
" they would n't take a large noisy piece to a small venue , " she said .
" and some orchestras have been trying to balance the noise by offsetting a very powerful piece by less powerful pieces . "
too late ?
others , she said , might follow the example of an australian opera orchestra , which decided a few years ago to use " one set of musicians for the first half and another set for the second half " to protect their hearing .
exactly how the directive will be implemented remains to be see , but once it comes into force for the music and entertainment sectors on feb .
15 , 2008 .
if a noise abatement directive had existed in the 19th century , perhaps beethoven would n't have gone deaf .
for modern-day musicians , however , the initiative may come too late .
" we 're all deaf anyway , " pesek said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

right-wing extremism and unemployment are the region 's biggest problems . the government warned that the presence of right-wing extremist parties was growing in eastern germany 's regional parliaments and could have implications for the economy .
" such tendencies are capable of negatively influencing the further development of the new -lsb- german -rsb- states , " wrote transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in the annual report on eastern german development , which he presented on wednesday , sept .
19 , in berlin .
the report said extreme right-wing parties had received mandates in regional parliaments as a result of a lack of democratic convictions and extreme right-wing beliefs which stemmed from a lack of democratic experience and not adequately facing up to german history .
extreme right-wing parties are represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony , which are all in germany 's east , as well as in bremen , in western germany .
" it is , however , clear to the majority of the people in eastern germany that the new states can only successfully pursue the pertinent economic and social route as a cosmopolitan and tolerant region , " the report said .

" i think we will still have to calculate in categories of ten to 15 , 20 years , " he told public tv channel ard on wednesday .
but things are gradually improving .
tiefensee said the region 's economy grew last year by 3 percent , the highest growth rate since the mid-1990s .
during the same time , western germany 's economy grew by 2.7 percent , he said .
still , unemployment in the east , at an average of 14.7 percent , was twice as high as in the country 's west , tiefensee said .
however , the number of those without jobs in eastern germany dropped in 2006 compared to the previous year by 134,000 to 1.48 million .

the german government announced it would pay compensation to some 50,000 workers in nazi germany 's jewish ghettos who previously failed to qualify for payouts from a fund for former slave laborers . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said on wednesday , sept 19 , that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved a finance ministry plan to award one-off payments of 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,789 -rrb- to those who have not yet received compensation from the holocaust memorial fund .
" the payment agreed today is not compensation for being interned in ghettos ... it is a humanitarian gesture , " wilhelm told reporters in berlin , stressing that it was aimed at people who did not receive compensation from a separate settlement created in 2000 that had paid out a total of 4.4 billion euros to survivors of the nazis ' forced labor programs . with merkel eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible , the announcement comes after weeks of discussion between german finance ministry officials and israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafi eitan . germany allegedly wanted to pay some 700 euros per person less , but israel insisted the offer was too low . a drawn out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision will apply to some 50,000 ghetto survivors compensation for ghetto workers , whose wages would have been negligible , is one of the last outstanding compensation claims dating back to hitler 's third reich .
the issue has long been the subject of negotiations with the new york-based jewish claims conference , which obtains compensation for holocaust survivors .
in germany , the setting up of the fund to compensate slave laborers was overshadowed by legal wrangling about contributions from companies which profited from the nazis ' labor policies during the third reich .
former slave laborers and their surviving relatives in over 100 countries received payouts from that fund , whose administrators announced in july that they had completed their task .
forgotten ghetto survivors in 2002 , the german parliament passed a law to grant the ghetto survivors a small pension , but the plan failed due to bureaucratic difficulties processing the claims .
the finance ministry said the government estimated there were still around 50,000 people eligible to claim the payment .
" the aim is to get the payment to the elderly applicants as quickly and as unbureaucratically as possible , " the ministry said , advising that applications could be made immediately to germany 's federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in bonn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.09.2007 internet home to most child sex crimes , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet porn peddlers increasingly push images of children ahead of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet , dw-world.de spoke to a german police investigator who used creative methods to crack a child pornography ring . on thursday , sept .
20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .
for something to be considered child pornography , it involves the sexual portrayal of a child - that is , according to german law , a person under age 14 .
the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .
they do n't know how they can manage from one day to the next .
and the child is then sold to sex criminals who film their acts and sometimes go on to sell these images .
are there certain areas within europe where the problems are greatest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international cooperation is crucial in identifying perpetrators and sexual exploitation victims no , there is no part of europe that is particularly more active than another .
everyone is equally affected by this .
do european countries and agencies work well together on this issue ? how can international cooperation be improved ?
in recent years , a number of different measures against child pornography were undertaken , and various alliances and groups were formed .
for example at interpol in lyon or europol in the hague .
also there is a tight connection between central german organizations , like the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , and their counterparts in london or paris .
and then , there are regular international conferences to discuss experiences and share information .
of course , it could all be improved upon .
but politicians are working on it , trying to harmonize certain things .
like the laws in various countries .
every country does n't apply the same laws to child sex offenses .
so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .
but now this has changed .
people recognize something must be done .
and i see that people are working very hard to protect children .
that 's what the goal of this work really is : to scare off potential child pornographers and protect children .
can individuals do anything to protect their children from becoming victims of internet related sex abuse ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in chat rooms can become prey for sex predators it is very important that parents and teachers learn how to use the media .
many teachers and parents just throw up their hands and say , " i do n't know how to use this ; you do it . "
they leave it up to the child to use the media .
so the children wind up in chat rooms where they think they are chatting with people of their own age .
but there are actually a lot of men there who are much older .
they claim to be young .
they make dates to meet , exchange phone numbers .
and then the date turns out to be a sexual assault .
teachers and parents really need to be aware of this .
there are too many people who still do n't know about it .
they should keep an eye on who their children know , who they are meeting , where and when . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government announced it would pay compensation to some 50,000 workers in nazi germany 's jewish ghettos who previously failed to qualify for payouts from a fund for former slave laborers . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said on wednesday , sept 19 , that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved a finance ministry plan to award one-off payments of 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,789 -rrb- to those who have not yet received compensation from the holocaust memorial fund .
" the payment agreed today is not compensation for being interned in ghettos ... it is a humanitarian gesture , " wilhelm told reporters in berlin , stressing that it was aimed at people who did not receive compensation from a separate settlement created in 2000 that had paid out a total of 4.4 billion euros to survivors of the nazis ' forced labor programs . with merkel eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible , the announcement comes after weeks of discussion between german finance ministry officials and israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafi eitan . germany allegedly wanted to pay some 700 euros per person less , but israel insisted the offer was too low . a drawn out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision will apply to some 50,000 ghetto survivors compensation for ghetto workers , whose wages would have been negligible , is one of the last outstanding compensation claims dating back to hitler 's third reich .
the issue has long been the subject of negotiations with the new york-based jewish claims conference , which obtains compensation for holocaust survivors .
in germany , the setting up of the fund to compensate slave laborers was overshadowed by legal wrangling about contributions from companies which profited from the nazis ' labor policies during the third reich .
former slave laborers and their surviving relatives in over 100 countries received payouts from that fund , whose administrators announced in july that they had completed their task .
forgotten ghetto survivors in 2002 , the german parliament passed a law to grant the ghetto survivors a small pension , but the plan failed due to bureaucratic difficulties processing the claims .
the finance ministry said the government estimated there were still around 50,000 people eligible to claim the payment .
" the aim is to get the payment to the elderly applicants as quickly and as unbureaucratically as possible , " the ministry said , advising that applications could be made immediately to germany 's federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in bonn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .
for something to be considered child pornography , it involves the sexual portrayal of a child - that is , according to german law , a person under age 14 .
the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .
they do n't know how they can manage from one day to the next .
and the child is then sold to sex criminals who film their acts and sometimes go on to sell these images .
are there certain areas within europe where the problems are greatest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international cooperation is crucial in identifying perpetrators and sexual exploitation victims no , there is no part of europe that is particularly more active than another .
everyone is equally affected by this .
do european countries and agencies work well together on this issue ? how can international cooperation be improved ?
in recent years , a number of different measures against child pornography were undertaken , and various alliances and groups were formed .
for example at interpol in lyon or europol in the hague .
also there is a tight connection between central german organizations , like the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , and their counterparts in london or paris .
and then , there are regular international conferences to discuss experiences and share information .
of course , it could all be improved upon .
but politicians are working on it , trying to harmonize certain things .
like the laws in various countries .
every country does n't apply the same laws to child sex offenses .
so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .
but now this has changed .
people recognize something must be done .
and i see that people are working very hard to protect children .
that 's what the goal of this work really is : to scare off potential child pornographers and protect children .
can individuals do anything to protect their children from becoming victims of internet related sex abuse ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in chat rooms can become prey for sex predators it is very important that parents and teachers learn how to use the media .
many teachers and parents just throw up their hands and say , " i do n't know how to use this ; you do it . "
they leave it up to the child to use the media .
so the children wind up in chat rooms where they think they are chatting with people of their own age .
but there are actually a lot of men there who are much older .
they claim to be young .
they make dates to meet , exchange phone numbers .
and then the date turns out to be a sexual assault .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .
for something to be considered child pornography , it involves the sexual portrayal of a child - that is , according to german law , a person under age 14 .
the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .
they do n't know how they can manage from one day to the next .

in recent years , a number of different measures against child pornography were undertaken , and various alliances and groups were formed .

also there is a tight connection between central german organizations , like the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , and their counterparts in london or paris .
and then , there are regular international conferences to discuss experiences and share information .
of course , it could all be improved upon .
but politicians are working on it , trying to harmonize certain things .
like the laws in various countries .
every country does n't apply the same laws to child sex offenses .
so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .
but now this has changed .
people recognize something must be done .

that 's what the goal of this work really is : to scare off potential child pornographers and protect children .

20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 20.09.2007 symphonic music may suffer under eu noise directive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come on , guys , i ca n't hear you !
when the eu introduced a directive five years ago aimed at reducing noise levels in the workplace , symphony orchestras were not covered by it .
starting next year , this will change .
will beethoven never sound the same ? " it ca n't work in symphony orchestras , " libor pesek , conductor of the prague symphony told ap news agency , referring to the eu noise directive .
" how could you apply it to gustav mahler , for instance , or richard strauss ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras may have to adjust to the new eu directive the thrust of the eu noise directive is aimed at protecting workers who are constantly exposed to high noise levels in places like construction sites or factories .
but that is not to say that classical music does n't have its victims .
a rare african okapi from the copenhagen zoo dropped dead in 1994 after opera singers exercised their joy of loud singing during open-air rehearsals in a nearby park .
" workplaces where workers are likely to be exposed to noise ... shall be marked with appropriate signs , " an excerpt from the eu directive reads .
" the areas in question shall also be delimited and access to them restricted . "
that may prove difficult with a symphony orchestra where noise is not simply an unwilling production side effect , but very much an essential part of the product .
considering that the maximum noise limit allowed by the eu is set at 85 decibels on an average work day , some fear that that the implementation of the noise directive could take all the fun out of fortissimos that decorate the music scores by tchaikovsky , stravinsky & co .
getting loud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some instruments are born more powerful than others trumpets are known to push out 110 decibels , tubas 110 and trombones 108 during peak moments of wagner 's operas .
even the violins - the instruments whose sweet , mellifluous sound usually accompanies the long-awaited declaration of love in a hollywood romantic comedy - can get pretty loud , registering 109 decibels .
which is why - at least in terms of their decibel levels - power drills sometimes sound like lullabies when compared to the force of a symphony orchestra .
alison reid wright , a noise expert who has worked with british orchestras , told ap that large ensembles are already readjusting their programs to conform with the directive .
" they would n't take a large noisy piece to a small venue , " she said .
" and some orchestras have been trying to balance the noise by offsetting a very powerful piece by less powerful pieces . "
too late ?
others , she said , might follow the example of an australian opera orchestra , which decided a few years ago to use " one set of musicians for the first half and another set for the second half " to protect their hearing .
exactly how the directive will be implemented remains to be see , but once it comes into force for the music and entertainment sectors on feb .
15 , 2008 .

when the eu introduced a directive five years ago aimed at reducing noise levels in the workplace , symphony orchestras were not covered by it .
starting next year , this will change .
will beethoven never sound the same ? " it ca n't work in symphony orchestras , " libor pesek , conductor of the prague symphony told ap news agency , referring to the eu noise directive .
" how could you apply it to gustav mahler , for instance , or richard strauss ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras may have to adjust to the new eu directive the thrust of the eu noise directive is aimed at protecting workers who are constantly exposed to high noise levels in places like construction sites or factories .
but that is not to say that classical music does n't have its victims .
a rare african okapi from the copenhagen zoo dropped dead in 1994 after opera singers exercised their joy of loud singing during open-air rehearsals in a nearby park .
" workplaces where workers are likely to be exposed to noise ... shall be marked with appropriate signs , " an excerpt from the eu directive reads .
" the areas in question shall also be delimited and access to them restricted . "
that may prove difficult with a symphony orchestra where noise is not simply an unwilling production side effect , but very much an essential part of the product .
considering that the maximum noise limit allowed by the eu is set at 85 decibels on an average work day , some fear that that the implementation of the noise directive could take all the fun out of fortissimos that decorate the music scores by tchaikovsky , stravinsky & co .
getting loud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some instruments are born more powerful than others trumpets are known to push out 110 decibels , tubas 110 and trombones 108 during peak moments of wagner 's operas .
even the violins - the instruments whose sweet , mellifluous sound usually accompanies the long-awaited declaration of love in a hollywood romantic comedy - can get pretty loud , registering 109 decibels .
which is why - at least in terms of their decibel levels - power drills sometimes sound like lullabies when compared to the force of a symphony orchestra .
alison reid wright , a noise expert who has worked with british orchestras , told ap that large ensembles are already readjusting their programs to conform with the directive .
" they would n't take a large noisy piece to a small venue , " she said .
" and some orchestras have been trying to balance the noise by offsetting a very powerful piece by less powerful pieces . "
too late ?
others , she said , might follow the example of an australian opera orchestra , which decided a few years ago to use " one set of musicians for the first half and another set for the second half " to protect their hearing .
exactly how the directive will be implemented remains to be see , but once it comes into force for the music and entertainment sectors on feb .

she then posed for glossy magazine park avenue wearing long black latex gloves that looked like they came out straight of your friendly german s & m studio next door or stretched provocatively on a massage bench .
finally , she attacked one of bavaria 's holy cows - the institution of marriage - and party leaders for having an outdated view of what marriage is like .

" maybe people live better outside of marriage . "

it is safe to assume at this point that gabriele pauli 's future in the pious csu does not look very promising .
but pauli is a professional .
with her phd in political science and no shame when it comes to media exposure , pauli could move on to bigger and better things .
one never knows what to expect from vampy conservatives .
for all we know , gabriele pauli could dye her hair blond , become the next spokesperson for st. pauli girl and launch a new marketing campaign under the motto " that kinky german beer . "
or she could become the mascot of fc st. pauli - a german soccer club with a gay president based in the st. pauli district of hamburg , the city 's fun zone - introducing the team to tight black latex jerseys and fishnets , a fashion move that could revolutionize the sport .

right-wing extremism and unemployment are the region 's biggest problems . the government warned that the presence of right-wing extremist parties was growing in eastern germany 's regional parliaments and could have implications for the economy .
" such tendencies are capable of negatively influencing the further development of the new -lsb- german -rsb- states , " wrote transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in the annual report on eastern german development , which he presented on wednesday , sept .
19 , in berlin .
the report said extreme right-wing parties had received mandates in regional parliaments as a result of a lack of democratic convictions and extreme right-wing beliefs which stemmed from a lack of democratic experience and not adequately facing up to german history .
extreme right-wing parties are represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony , which are all in germany 's east , as well as in bremen , in western germany .
" it is , however , clear to the majority of the people in eastern germany that the new states can only successfully pursue the pertinent economic and social route as a cosmopolitan and tolerant region , " the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee tiefensee , whose mandate includes eastern german development , called for more social cohesion , stressing the need for a lively society .
" this is ... important in order to deprive anti-democratic , radical right-wing and xenophobic tendencies of their breeding ground , " he said .
no end in sight to subsidies eastern germany 's economy still ca n't survive without government aid , and it will continue to be aid-dependant for years , the minister explained . " i think we will still have to calculate in categories of ten to 15 , 20 years , " he told public tv channel ard on wednesday .
but things are gradually improving .
tiefensee said the region 's economy grew last year by 3 percent , the highest growth rate since the mid-1990s .
during the same time , western germany 's economy grew by 2.7 percent , he said .
still , unemployment in the east , at an average of 14.7 percent , was twice as high as in the country 's west , tiefensee said .
however , the number of those without jobs in eastern germany dropped in 2006 compared to the previous year by 134,000 to 1.48 million .
the opposition green party was critical of tiefensee 's comments .

right-wing extremism and unemployment are the region 's biggest problems . the government warned that the presence of right-wing extremist parties was growing in eastern germany 's regional parliaments and could have implications for the economy .
" such tendencies are capable of negatively influencing the further development of the new -lsb- german -rsb- states , " wrote transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in the annual report on eastern german development , which he presented on wednesday , sept .
19 , in berlin .
the report said extreme right-wing parties had received mandates in regional parliaments as a result of a lack of democratic convictions and extreme right-wing beliefs which stemmed from a lack of democratic experience and not adequately facing up to german history .
extreme right-wing parties are represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony , which are all in germany 's east , as well as in bremen , in western germany .
" it is , however , clear to the majority of the people in eastern germany that the new states can only successfully pursue the pertinent economic and social route as a cosmopolitan and tolerant region , " the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee tiefensee , whose mandate includes eastern german development , called for more social cohesion , stressing the need for a lively society .
" this is ... important in order to deprive anti-democratic , radical right-wing and xenophobic tendencies of their breeding ground , " he said .
no end in sight to subsidies eastern germany 's economy still ca n't survive without government aid , and it will continue to be aid-dependant for years , the minister explained . " i think we will still have to calculate in categories of ten to 15 , 20 years , " he told public tv channel ard on wednesday .
but things are gradually improving .
tiefensee said the region 's economy grew last year by 3 percent , the highest growth rate since the mid-1990s .
during the same time , western germany 's economy grew by 2.7 percent , he said .
still , unemployment in the east , at an average of 14.7 percent , was twice as high as in the country 's west , tiefensee said .
however , the number of those without jobs in eastern germany dropped in 2006 compared to the previous year by 134,000 to 1.48 million .
the opposition green party was critical of tiefensee 's comments .
" at this speed , in 100 years we will have equal standards of living in east and west , " said parliamentarian peter hettlich . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when the eu introduced a directive five years ago aimed at reducing noise levels in the workplace , symphony orchestras were not covered by it .
starting next year , this will change .
will beethoven never sound the same ? " it ca n't work in symphony orchestras , " libor pesek , conductor of the prague symphony told ap news agency , referring to the eu noise directive .
" how could you apply it to gustav mahler , for instance , or richard strauss ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras may have to adjust to the new eu directive the thrust of the eu noise directive is aimed at protecting workers who are constantly exposed to high noise levels in places like construction sites or factories .
but that is not to say that classical music does n't have its victims .
a rare african okapi from the copenhagen zoo dropped dead in 1994 after opera singers exercised their joy of loud singing during open-air rehearsals in a nearby park .
" workplaces where workers are likely to be exposed to noise ... shall be marked with appropriate signs , " an excerpt from the eu directive reads .
" the areas in question shall also be delimited and access to them restricted . "
that may prove difficult with a symphony orchestra where noise is not simply an unwilling production side effect , but very much an essential part of the product .
considering that the maximum noise limit allowed by the eu is set at 85 decibels on an average work day , some fear that that the implementation of the noise directive could take all the fun out of fortissimos that decorate the music scores by tchaikovsky , stravinsky & co .
getting loud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some instruments are born more powerful than others trumpets are known to push out 110 decibels , tubas 110 and trombones 108 during peak moments of wagner 's operas .
even the violins - the instruments whose sweet , mellifluous sound usually accompanies the long-awaited declaration of love in a hollywood romantic comedy - can get pretty loud , registering 109 decibels .
which is why - at least in terms of their decibel levels - power drills sometimes sound like lullabies when compared to the force of a symphony orchestra .
alison reid wright , a noise expert who has worked with british orchestras , told ap that large ensembles are already readjusting their programs to conform with the directive .
" they would n't take a large noisy piece to a small venue , " she said .
" and some orchestras have been trying to balance the noise by offsetting a very powerful piece by less powerful pieces . "
too late ?
others , she said , might follow the example of an australian opera orchestra , which decided a few years ago to use " one set of musicians for the first half and another set for the second half " to protect their hearing .
exactly how the directive will be implemented remains to be see , but once it comes into force for the music and entertainment sectors on feb .
15 , 2008 .
if a noise abatement directive had existed in the 19th century , perhaps beethoven would n't have gone deaf .
for modern-day musicians , however , the initiative may come too late .

when the eu introduced a directive five years ago aimed at reducing noise levels in the workplace , symphony orchestras were not covered by it .
starting next year , this will change .
will beethoven never sound the same ? " it ca n't work in symphony orchestras , " libor pesek , conductor of the prague symphony told ap news agency , referring to the eu noise directive .
" how could you apply it to gustav mahler , for instance , or richard strauss ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras may have to adjust to the new eu directive the thrust of the eu noise directive is aimed at protecting workers who are constantly exposed to high noise levels in places like construction sites or factories .
but that is not to say that classical music does n't have its victims .
a rare african okapi from the copenhagen zoo dropped dead in 1994 after opera singers exercised their joy of loud singing during open-air rehearsals in a nearby park .
" workplaces where workers are likely to be exposed to noise ... shall be marked with appropriate signs , " an excerpt from the eu directive reads .
" the areas in question shall also be delimited and access to them restricted . "
that may prove difficult with a symphony orchestra where noise is not simply an unwilling production side effect , but very much an essential part of the product .
considering that the maximum noise limit allowed by the eu is set at 85 decibels on an average work day , some fear that that the implementation of the noise directive could take all the fun out of fortissimos that decorate the music scores by tchaikovsky , stravinsky & co .

even the violins - the instruments whose sweet , mellifluous sound usually accompanies the long-awaited declaration of love in a hollywood romantic comedy - can get pretty loud , registering 109 decibels .
which is why - at least in terms of their decibel levels - power drills sometimes sound like lullabies when compared to the force of a symphony orchestra .
alison reid wright , a noise expert who has worked with british orchestras , told ap that large ensembles are already readjusting their programs to conform with the directive .
" they would n't take a large noisy piece to a small venue , " she said .
" and some orchestras have been trying to balance the noise by offsetting a very powerful piece by less powerful pieces . "
too late ?
others , she said , might follow the example of an australian opera orchestra , which decided a few years ago to use " one set of musicians for the first half and another set for the second half " to protect their hearing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.09.2007 internet home to most child sex crimes , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet porn peddlers increasingly push images of children ahead of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet , dw-world.de spoke to a german police investigator who used creative methods to crack a child pornography ring . on thursday , sept .
20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .

the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .

20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?

dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .
for something to be considered child pornography , it involves the sexual portrayal of a child - that is , according to german law , a person under age 14 .
the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .
they do n't know how they can manage from one day to the next .
and the child is then sold to sex criminals who film their acts and sometimes go on to sell these images .
are there certain areas within europe where the problems are greatest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international cooperation is crucial in identifying perpetrators and sexual exploitation victims no , there is no part of europe that is particularly more active than another .
everyone is equally affected by this .
do european countries and agencies work well together on this issue ? how can international cooperation be improved ?
in recent years , a number of different measures against child pornography were undertaken , and various alliances and groups were formed .
for example at interpol in lyon or europol in the hague .
also there is a tight connection between central german organizations , like the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , and their counterparts in london or paris .
and then , there are regular international conferences to discuss experiences and share information .
of course , it could all be improved upon .
but politicians are working on it , trying to harmonize certain things .
like the laws in various countries .
every country does n't apply the same laws to child sex offenses .
so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .
but now this has changed .
people recognize something must be done .
and i see that people are working very hard to protect children .
that 's what the goal of this work really is : to scare off potential child pornographers and protect children .
can individuals do anything to protect their children from becoming victims of internet related sex abuse ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in chat rooms can become prey for sex predators it is very important that parents and teachers learn how to use the media .
many teachers and parents just throw up their hands and say , " i do n't know how to use this ; you do it . "
they leave it up to the child to use the media .
so the children wind up in chat rooms where they think they are chatting with people of their own age .

20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .

the german government announced it would pay compensation to some 50,000 workers in nazi germany 's jewish ghettos who previously failed to qualify for payouts from a fund for former slave laborers . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said on wednesday , sept 19 , that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved a finance ministry plan to award one-off payments of 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,789 -rrb- to those who have not yet received compensation from the holocaust memorial fund .
" the payment agreed today is not compensation for being interned in ghettos ... it is a humanitarian gesture , " wilhelm told reporters in berlin , stressing that it was aimed at people who did not receive compensation from a separate settlement created in 2000 that had paid out a total of 4.4 billion euros to survivors of the nazis ' forced labor programs . with merkel eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible , the announcement comes after weeks of discussion between german finance ministry officials and israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafi eitan . germany allegedly wanted to pay some 700 euros per person less , but israel insisted the offer was too low . a drawn out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision will apply to some 50,000 ghetto survivors compensation for ghetto workers , whose wages would have been negligible , is one of the last outstanding compensation claims dating back to hitler 's third reich .
the issue has long been the subject of negotiations with the new york-based jewish claims conference , which obtains compensation for holocaust survivors .
in germany , the setting up of the fund to compensate slave laborers was overshadowed by legal wrangling about contributions from companies which profited from the nazis ' labor policies during the third reich .
former slave laborers and their surviving relatives in over 100 countries received payouts from that fund , whose administrators announced in july that they had completed their task .
forgotten ghetto survivors in 2002 , the german parliament passed a law to grant the ghetto survivors a small pension , but the plan failed due to bureaucratic difficulties processing the claims .
the finance ministry said the government estimated there were still around 50,000 people eligible to claim the payment .
" the aim is to get the payment to the elderly applicants as quickly and as unbureaucratically as possible , " the ministry said , advising that applications could be made immediately to germany 's federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in bonn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government announced it would pay compensation to some 50,000 workers in nazi germany 's jewish ghettos who previously failed to qualify for payouts from a fund for former slave laborers . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said on wednesday , sept 19 , that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved a finance ministry plan to award one-off payments of 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,789 -rrb- to those who have not yet received compensation from the holocaust memorial fund .
" the payment agreed today is not compensation for being interned in ghettos ... it is a humanitarian gesture , " wilhelm told reporters in berlin , stressing that it was aimed at people who did not receive compensation from a separate settlement created in 2000 that had paid out a total of 4.4 billion euros to survivors of the nazis ' forced labor programs . with merkel eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible , the announcement comes after weeks of discussion between german finance ministry officials and israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafi eitan . germany allegedly wanted to pay some 700 euros per person less , but israel insisted the offer was too low . a drawn out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision will apply to some 50,000 ghetto survivors compensation for ghetto workers , whose wages would have been negligible , is one of the last outstanding compensation claims dating back to hitler 's third reich .
the issue has long been the subject of negotiations with the new york-based jewish claims conference , which obtains compensation for holocaust survivors .
in germany , the setting up of the fund to compensate slave laborers was overshadowed by legal wrangling about contributions from companies which profited from the nazis ' labor policies during the third reich .
former slave laborers and their surviving relatives in over 100 countries received payouts from that fund , whose administrators announced in july that they had completed their task .
forgotten ghetto survivors in 2002 , the german parliament passed a law to grant the ghetto survivors a small pension , but the plan failed due to bureaucratic difficulties processing the claims .
the finance ministry said the government estimated there were still around 50,000 people eligible to claim the payment .
" the aim is to get the payment to the elderly applicants as quickly and as unbureaucratically as possible , " the ministry said , advising that applications could be made immediately to germany 's federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in bonn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 20.09.2007 bavarian politician proposes seven-year limit on marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not your average conservative politician : gabriele pauli in a wild-gamble election bid for the leadership of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a two-time divorcee who put the kink back into conservative politics , suggested that marriages should dissolve automatically . " i propose that marriages lapse after seven years , " gabriele pauli told reporters in munich on wednesday , sept .
19 , announcing her platform for the upcoming party congress .
" this would mean that one will only commit for a fixed period and will actively have to renew your vows if you still want to continue . " with statistics showing that almost 38 percent of germans who marry today are likely to get divorced , pauli believes that putting a time constraint on the sacrament of holy matrimony would save many people the trouble and drudgery of filing the divorce papers . but making marriage sound like a business investment with an exit strategy just as the seven-year itch sets in does not win you brownie points with party officials in a center-right , catholic-dominated party .
" that 's an absurd idea and totally contrary to the program of the csu , " said german agriculture minister and csu member horst seehofer , who is also wants to become party leader .
" we are not in a circus , " he said .
" with ideas like that , she should give up her candidacy . "
controversy , here i come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although not all csu members wear lederhosen , the party is largely conservative whether earning one 's bread as a politician is altogether that different from working in a circus is a moot point .
but gabriele pauli , district administrator in the bavarian suburban county of fürth , is no stranger to controversy .
if anybody ever decided to write a " how not to become a leader of a bavarian conservative party for dummies , " they would make the manual very useful alone by highlighting all the things that pauli did over the past year .
she emerged from obscurity at a party congress by saying out loud what most people do n't even dream of telling their priest in confession : that premier edmund stoiber - the towering giant of bavarian politics - had become a liability and that he should really think about retirement .
she then posed for glossy magazine park avenue wearing long black latex gloves that looked like they came out straight of your friendly german s & m studio next door or stretched provocatively on a massage bench .
finally , she attacked one of bavaria 's holy cows - the institution of marriage - and party leaders for having an outdated view of what marriage is like .
" for me , family is a different type of formation than for the csu , " pauli said .
" maybe people live better outside of marriage . "
what next ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could gabriele pauli be the next edmund stoiber ?
it is safe to assume at this point that gabriele pauli 's future in the pious csu does not look very promising .
but pauli is a professional .
with her phd in political science and no shame when it comes to media exposure , pauli could move on to bigger and better things .
one never knows what to expect from vampy conservatives .
for all we know , gabriele pauli could dye her hair blond , become the next spokesperson for st. pauli girl and launch a new marketing campaign under the motto " that kinky german beer . "

she then posed for glossy magazine park avenue wearing long black latex gloves that looked like they came out straight of your friendly german s & m studio next door or stretched provocatively on a massage bench .

" i propose that marriages lapse after seven years , " gabriele pauli told reporters in munich on wednesday , sept .
19 , announcing her platform for the upcoming party congress .
" this would mean that one will only commit for a fixed period and will actively have to renew your vows if you still want to continue . " with statistics showing that almost 38 percent of germans who marry today are likely to get divorced , pauli believes that putting a time constraint on the sacrament of holy matrimony would save many people the trouble and drudgery of filing the divorce papers . but making marriage sound like a business investment with an exit strategy just as the seven-year itch sets in does not win you brownie points with party officials in a center-right , catholic-dominated party .
" that 's an absurd idea and totally contrary to the program of the csu , " said german agriculture minister and csu member horst seehofer , who is also wants to become party leader .
" we are not in a circus , " he said .
" with ideas like that , she should give up her candidacy . "
controversy , here i come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although not all csu members wear lederhosen , the party is largely conservative whether earning one 's bread as a politician is altogether that different from working in a circus is a moot point .
but gabriele pauli , district administrator in the bavarian suburban county of fürth , is no stranger to controversy .
if anybody ever decided to write a " how not to become a leader of a bavarian conservative party for dummies , " they would make the manual very useful alone by highlighting all the things that pauli did over the past year .
she emerged from obscurity at a party congress by saying out loud what most people do n't even dream of telling their priest in confession : that premier edmund stoiber - the towering giant of bavarian politics - had become a liability and that he should really think about retirement .
she then posed for glossy magazine park avenue wearing long black latex gloves that looked like they came out straight of your friendly german s & m studio next door or stretched provocatively on a massage bench .
finally , she attacked one of bavaria 's holy cows - the institution of marriage - and party leaders for having an outdated view of what marriage is like .
" for me , family is a different type of formation than for the csu , " pauli said .
" maybe people live better outside of marriage . "

it is safe to assume at this point that gabriele pauli 's future in the pious csu does not look very promising .
but pauli is a professional .
with her phd in political science and no shame when it comes to media exposure , pauli could move on to bigger and better things .
one never knows what to expect from vampy conservatives .

right-wing extremism and unemployment are the region 's biggest problems . the government warned that the presence of right-wing extremist parties was growing in eastern germany 's regional parliaments and could have implications for the economy .
" such tendencies are capable of negatively influencing the further development of the new -lsb- german -rsb- states , " wrote transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in the annual report on eastern german development , which he presented on wednesday , sept .
19 , in berlin .
the report said extreme right-wing parties had received mandates in regional parliaments as a result of a lack of democratic convictions and extreme right-wing beliefs which stemmed from a lack of democratic experience and not adequately facing up to german history .
extreme right-wing parties are represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony , which are all in germany 's east , as well as in bremen , in western germany .
" it is , however , clear to the majority of the people in eastern germany that the new states can only successfully pursue the pertinent economic and social route as a cosmopolitan and tolerant region , " the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee tiefensee , whose mandate includes eastern german development , called for more social cohesion , stressing the need for a lively society .
" this is ... important in order to deprive anti-democratic , radical right-wing and xenophobic tendencies of their breeding ground , " he said .
no end in sight to subsidies eastern germany 's economy still ca n't survive without government aid , and it will continue to be aid-dependant for years , the minister explained . " i think we will still have to calculate in categories of ten to 15 , 20 years , " he told public tv channel ard on wednesday .
but things are gradually improving .
tiefensee said the region 's economy grew last year by 3 percent , the highest growth rate since the mid-1990s .
during the same time , western germany 's economy grew by 2.7 percent , he said .
still , unemployment in the east , at an average of 14.7 percent , was twice as high as in the country 's west , tiefensee said .
however , the number of those without jobs in eastern germany dropped in 2006 compared to the previous year by 134,000 to 1.48 million .
the opposition green party was critical of tiefensee 's comments .

20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .
for something to be considered child pornography , it involves the sexual portrayal of a child - that is , according to german law , a person under age 14 .
the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .
they do n't know how they can manage from one day to the next .
and the child is then sold to sex criminals who film their acts and sometimes go on to sell these images .
are there certain areas within europe where the problems are greatest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international cooperation is crucial in identifying perpetrators and sexual exploitation victims no , there is no part of europe that is particularly more active than another .
everyone is equally affected by this .
do european countries and agencies work well together on this issue ? how can international cooperation be improved ?
in recent years , a number of different measures against child pornography were undertaken , and various alliances and groups were formed .
for example at interpol in lyon or europol in the hague .
also there is a tight connection between central german organizations , like the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , and their counterparts in london or paris .
and then , there are regular international conferences to discuss experiences and share information .
of course , it could all be improved upon .
but politicians are working on it , trying to harmonize certain things .
like the laws in various countries .
every country does n't apply the same laws to child sex offenses .
so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .
but now this has changed .
people recognize something must be done .
and i see that people are working very hard to protect children .
that 's what the goal of this work really is : to scare off potential child pornographers and protect children .
can individuals do anything to protect their children from becoming victims of internet related sex abuse ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in chat rooms can become prey for sex predators it is very important that parents and teachers learn how to use the media .
many teachers and parents just throw up their hands and say , " i do n't know how to use this ; you do it . "
they leave it up to the child to use the media .
so the children wind up in chat rooms where they think they are chatting with people of their own age .
but there are actually a lot of men there who are much older .
they claim to be young .
they make dates to meet , exchange phone numbers .
and then the date turns out to be a sexual assault .
teachers and parents really need to be aware of this .
there are too many people who still do n't know about it .

so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .

that 's what the goal of this work really is : to scare off potential child pornographers and protect children .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in chat rooms can become prey for sex predators it is very important that parents and teachers learn how to use the media .
many teachers and parents just throw up their hands and say , " i do n't know how to use this ; you do it . "

so the children wind up in chat rooms where they think they are chatting with people of their own age .
but there are actually a lot of men there who are much older .
they claim to be young .
they make dates to meet , exchange phone numbers .
and then the date turns out to be a sexual assault .
teachers and parents really need to be aware of this .
there are too many people who still do n't know about it .

the german government announced it would pay compensation to some 50,000 workers in nazi germany 's jewish ghettos who previously failed to qualify for payouts from a fund for former slave laborers . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said on wednesday , sept 19 , that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved a finance ministry plan to award one-off payments of 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,789 -rrb- to those who have not yet received compensation from the holocaust memorial fund .
" the payment agreed today is not compensation for being interned in ghettos ... it is a humanitarian gesture , " wilhelm told reporters in berlin , stressing that it was aimed at people who did not receive compensation from a separate settlement created in 2000 that had paid out a total of 4.4 billion euros to survivors of the nazis ' forced labor programs . with merkel eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible , the announcement comes after weeks of discussion between german finance ministry officials and israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafi eitan . germany allegedly wanted to pay some 700 euros per person less , but israel insisted the offer was too low . a drawn out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision will apply to some 50,000 ghetto survivors compensation for ghetto workers , whose wages would have been negligible , is one of the last outstanding compensation claims dating back to hitler 's third reich .

in germany , the setting up of the fund to compensate slave laborers was overshadowed by legal wrangling about contributions from companies which profited from the nazis ' labor policies during the third reich .
former slave laborers and their surviving relatives in over 100 countries received payouts from that fund , whose administrators announced in july that they had completed their task .
forgotten ghetto survivors in 2002 , the german parliament passed a law to grant the ghetto survivors a small pension , but the plan failed due to bureaucratic difficulties processing the claims .

the german government announced it would pay compensation to some 50,000 workers in nazi germany 's jewish ghettos who previously failed to qualify for payouts from a fund for former slave laborers . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said on wednesday , sept 19 , that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved a finance ministry plan to award one-off payments of 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,789 -rrb- to those who have not yet received compensation from the holocaust memorial fund .
" the payment agreed today is not compensation for being interned in ghettos ... it is a humanitarian gesture , " wilhelm told reporters in berlin , stressing that it was aimed at people who did not receive compensation from a separate settlement created in 2000 that had paid out a total of 4.4 billion euros to survivors of the nazis ' forced labor programs . with merkel eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible , the announcement comes after weeks of discussion between german finance ministry officials and israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafi eitan . germany allegedly wanted to pay some 700 euros per person less , but israel insisted the offer was too low . a drawn out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision will apply to some 50,000 ghetto survivors compensation for ghetto workers , whose wages would have been negligible , is one of the last outstanding compensation claims dating back to hitler 's third reich .
the issue has long been the subject of negotiations with the new york-based jewish claims conference , which obtains compensation for holocaust survivors .
in germany , the setting up of the fund to compensate slave laborers was overshadowed by legal wrangling about contributions from companies which profited from the nazis ' labor policies during the third reich .
former slave laborers and their surviving relatives in over 100 countries received payouts from that fund , whose administrators announced in july that they had completed their task .
forgotten ghetto survivors in 2002 , the german parliament passed a law to grant the ghetto survivors a small pension , but the plan failed due to bureaucratic difficulties processing the claims .
the finance ministry said the government estimated there were still around 50,000 people eligible to claim the payment .
" the aim is to get the payment to the elderly applicants as quickly and as unbureaucratically as possible , " the ministry said , advising that applications could be made immediately to germany 's federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in bonn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 20.09.2007 bavarian politician proposes seven-year limit on marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not your average conservative politician : gabriele pauli in a wild-gamble election bid for the leadership of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a two-time divorcee who put the kink back into conservative politics , suggested that marriages should dissolve automatically . " i propose that marriages lapse after seven years , " gabriele pauli told reporters in munich on wednesday , sept .
19 , announcing her platform for the upcoming party congress .
" this would mean that one will only commit for a fixed period and will actively have to renew your vows if you still want to continue . " with statistics showing that almost 38 percent of germans who marry today are likely to get divorced , pauli believes that putting a time constraint on the sacrament of holy matrimony would save many people the trouble and drudgery of filing the divorce papers . but making marriage sound like a business investment with an exit strategy just as the seven-year itch sets in does not win you brownie points with party officials in a center-right , catholic-dominated party .
" that 's an absurd idea and totally contrary to the program of the csu , " said german agriculture minister and csu member horst seehofer , who is also wants to become party leader .
" we are not in a circus , " he said .
" with ideas like that , she should give up her candidacy . "
controversy , here i come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although not all csu members wear lederhosen , the party is largely conservative whether earning one 's bread as a politician is altogether that different from working in a circus is a moot point .
but gabriele pauli , district administrator in the bavarian suburban county of fürth , is no stranger to controversy .
if anybody ever decided to write a " how not to become a leader of a bavarian conservative party for dummies , " they would make the manual very useful alone by highlighting all the things that pauli did over the past year .
she emerged from obscurity at a party congress by saying out loud what most people do n't even dream of telling their priest in confession : that premier edmund stoiber - the towering giant of bavarian politics - had become a liability and that he should really think about retirement .
she then posed for glossy magazine park avenue wearing long black latex gloves that looked like they came out straight of your friendly german s & m studio next door or stretched provocatively on a massage bench .
finally , she attacked one of bavaria 's holy cows - the institution of marriage - and party leaders for having an outdated view of what marriage is like .
" for me , family is a different type of formation than for the csu , " pauli said .
" maybe people live better outside of marriage . "
what next ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could gabriele pauli be the next edmund stoiber ?
it is safe to assume at this point that gabriele pauli 's future in the pious csu does not look very promising .
but pauli is a professional .
with her phd in political science and no shame when it comes to media exposure , pauli could move on to bigger and better things .
one never knows what to expect from vampy conservatives .
for all we know , gabriele pauli could dye her hair blond , become the next spokesperson for st. pauli girl and launch a new marketing campaign under the motto " that kinky german beer . "
or she could become the mascot of fc st. pauli - a german soccer club with a gay president based in the st. pauli district of hamburg , the city 's fun zone - introducing the team to tight black latex jerseys and fishnets , a fashion move that could revolutionize the sport .
gabriele pauli is here to stay . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for bavarian leader , it 's same difference in his last grand speech as bavarian premier , edmund stoiber got a little confused .

still , unemployment in the east , at an average of 14.7 percent , was twice as high as in the country 's west , tiefensee said .
however , the number of those without jobs in eastern germany dropped in 2006 compared to the previous year by 134,000 to 1.48 million .
the opposition green party was critical of tiefensee 's comments .
" at this speed , in 100 years we will have equal standards of living in east and west , " said parliamentarian peter hettlich . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when the eu introduced a directive five years ago aimed at reducing noise levels in the workplace , symphony orchestras were not covered by it .
starting next year , this will change .
will beethoven never sound the same ? " it ca n't work in symphony orchestras , " libor pesek , conductor of the prague symphony told ap news agency , referring to the eu noise directive .
" how could you apply it to gustav mahler , for instance , or richard strauss ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras may have to adjust to the new eu directive the thrust of the eu noise directive is aimed at protecting workers who are constantly exposed to high noise levels in places like construction sites or factories .
but that is not to say that classical music does n't have its victims .
a rare african okapi from the copenhagen zoo dropped dead in 1994 after opera singers exercised their joy of loud singing during open-air rehearsals in a nearby park .
" workplaces where workers are likely to be exposed to noise ... shall be marked with appropriate signs , " an excerpt from the eu directive reads .
" the areas in question shall also be delimited and access to them restricted . "
that may prove difficult with a symphony orchestra where noise is not simply an unwilling production side effect , but very much an essential part of the product .
considering that the maximum noise limit allowed by the eu is set at 85 decibels on an average work day , some fear that that the implementation of the noise directive could take all the fun out of fortissimos that decorate the music scores by tchaikovsky , stravinsky & co .

even the violins - the instruments whose sweet , mellifluous sound usually accompanies the long-awaited declaration of love in a hollywood romantic comedy - can get pretty loud , registering 109 decibels .
which is why - at least in terms of their decibel levels - power drills sometimes sound like lullabies when compared to the force of a symphony orchestra .
alison reid wright , a noise expert who has worked with british orchestras , told ap that large ensembles are already readjusting their programs to conform with the directive .
" they would n't take a large noisy piece to a small venue , " she said .
" and some orchestras have been trying to balance the noise by offsetting a very powerful piece by less powerful pieces . "
too late ?
others , she said , might follow the example of an australian opera orchestra , which decided a few years ago to use " one set of musicians for the first half and another set for the second half " to protect their hearing .
exactly how the directive will be implemented remains to be see , but once it comes into force for the music and entertainment sectors on feb .
15 , 2008 .
if a noise abatement directive had existed in the 19th century , perhaps beethoven would n't have gone deaf .

20 , to vote in favor of prolonging the german army 's mandate in the realm of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan as well as that of its six tornado reconnaissance jets , which currently assist the mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pulling out troops now would reverse progress already made , steinmeier said " anyone who demands withdrawal of the troops from afghanistan puts at risk everything that we have built up in the last six years , " the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- said , though he conceded that " the way has been harder than many of us had hoped . "
the spd , chancellor angela merkel 's christian union and the free-market liberal fdp expressed their support for extending the mission in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
their combined votes are enough for the extension to be approved when lawmakers decide the issue in three weeks .
the left party 's parliamentary leader gregor gysi reiterated his party 's rejection of the mission , referring to polls that showed that a majority of germans wanted their soldiers to leave afghanistan .

the german government announced it would pay compensation to some 50,000 workers in nazi germany 's jewish ghettos who previously failed to qualify for payouts from a fund for former slave laborers . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said on wednesday , sept 19 , that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved a finance ministry plan to award one-off payments of 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,789 -rrb- to those who have not yet received compensation from the holocaust memorial fund .
" the payment agreed today is not compensation for being interned in ghettos ... it is a humanitarian gesture , " wilhelm told reporters in berlin , stressing that it was aimed at people who did not receive compensation from a separate settlement created in 2000 that had paid out a total of 4.4 billion euros to survivors of the nazis ' forced labor programs . with merkel eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible , the announcement comes after weeks of discussion between german finance ministry officials and israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafi eitan . germany allegedly wanted to pay some 700 euros per person less , but israel insisted the offer was too low . a drawn out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision will apply to some 50,000 ghetto survivors compensation for ghetto workers , whose wages would have been negligible , is one of the last outstanding compensation claims dating back to hitler 's third reich .
the issue has long been the subject of negotiations with the new york-based jewish claims conference , which obtains compensation for holocaust survivors .
in germany , the setting up of the fund to compensate slave laborers was overshadowed by legal wrangling about contributions from companies which profited from the nazis ' labor policies during the third reich .

the german government announced it would pay compensation to some 50,000 workers in nazi germany 's jewish ghettos who previously failed to qualify for payouts from a fund for former slave laborers . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said on wednesday , sept 19 , that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved a finance ministry plan to award one-off payments of 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,789 -rrb- to those who have not yet received compensation from the holocaust memorial fund .
" the payment agreed today is not compensation for being interned in ghettos ... it is a humanitarian gesture , " wilhelm told reporters in berlin , stressing that it was aimed at people who did not receive compensation from a separate settlement created in 2000 that had paid out a total of 4.4 billion euros to survivors of the nazis ' forced labor programs . with merkel eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible , the announcement comes after weeks of discussion between german finance ministry officials and israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafi eitan . germany allegedly wanted to pay some 700 euros per person less , but israel insisted the offer was too low . a drawn out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision will apply to some 50,000 ghetto survivors compensation for ghetto workers , whose wages would have been negligible , is one of the last outstanding compensation claims dating back to hitler 's third reich .
the issue has long been the subject of negotiations with the new york-based jewish claims conference , which obtains compensation for holocaust survivors .
in germany , the setting up of the fund to compensate slave laborers was overshadowed by legal wrangling about contributions from companies which profited from the nazis ' labor policies during the third reich .

the german government announced it would pay compensation to some 50,000 workers in nazi germany 's jewish ghettos who previously failed to qualify for payouts from a fund for former slave laborers . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said on wednesday , sept 19 , that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved a finance ministry plan to award one-off payments of 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,789 -rrb- to those who have not yet received compensation from the holocaust memorial fund .
" the payment agreed today is not compensation for being interned in ghettos ... it is a humanitarian gesture , " wilhelm told reporters in berlin , stressing that it was aimed at people who did not receive compensation from a separate settlement created in 2000 that had paid out a total of 4.4 billion euros to survivors of the nazis ' forced labor programs . with merkel eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible , the announcement comes after weeks of discussion between german finance ministry officials and israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafi eitan . germany allegedly wanted to pay some 700 euros per person less , but israel insisted the offer was too low . a drawn out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision will apply to some 50,000 ghetto survivors compensation for ghetto workers , whose wages would have been negligible , is one of the last outstanding compensation claims dating back to hitler 's third reich .
the issue has long been the subject of negotiations with the new york-based jewish claims conference , which obtains compensation for holocaust survivors .
in germany , the setting up of the fund to compensate slave laborers was overshadowed by legal wrangling about contributions from companies which profited from the nazis ' labor policies during the third reich .
former slave laborers and their surviving relatives in over 100 countries received payouts from that fund , whose administrators announced in july that they had completed their task .
forgotten ghetto survivors in 2002 , the german parliament passed a law to grant the ghetto survivors a small pension , but the plan failed due to bureaucratic difficulties processing the claims .
the finance ministry said the government estimated there were still around 50,000 people eligible to claim the payment .
" the aim is to get the payment to the elderly applicants as quickly and as unbureaucratically as possible , " the ministry said , advising that applications could be made immediately to germany 's federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in bonn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this would mean that one will only commit for a fixed period and will actively have to renew your vows if you still want to continue . " with statistics showing that almost 38 percent of germans who marry today are likely to get divorced , pauli believes that putting a time constraint on the sacrament of holy matrimony would save many people the trouble and drudgery of filing the divorce papers . but making marriage sound like a business investment with an exit strategy just as the seven-year itch sets in does not win you brownie points with party officials in a center-right , catholic-dominated party .
" that 's an absurd idea and totally contrary to the program of the csu , " said german agriculture minister and csu member horst seehofer , who is also wants to become party leader .

if anybody ever decided to write a " how not to become a leader of a bavarian conservative party for dummies , " they would make the manual very useful alone by highlighting all the things that pauli did over the past year .
she emerged from obscurity at a party congress by saying out loud what most people do n't even dream of telling their priest in confession : that premier edmund stoiber - the towering giant of bavarian politics - had become a liability and that he should really think about retirement .
she then posed for glossy magazine park avenue wearing long black latex gloves that looked like they came out straight of your friendly german s & m studio next door or stretched provocatively on a massage bench .
finally , she attacked one of bavaria 's holy cows - the institution of marriage - and party leaders for having an outdated view of what marriage is like .

" maybe people live better outside of marriage . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.09.2007 internet home to most child sex crimes , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet porn peddlers increasingly push images of children ahead of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet , dw-world.de spoke to a german police investigator who used creative methods to crack a child pornography ring . on thursday , sept .
20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .
for something to be considered child pornography , it involves the sexual portrayal of a child - that is , according to german law , a person under age 14 .
the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .
they do n't know how they can manage from one day to the next .
and the child is then sold to sex criminals who film their acts and sometimes go on to sell these images .
are there certain areas within europe where the problems are greatest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international cooperation is crucial in identifying perpetrators and sexual exploitation victims no , there is no part of europe that is particularly more active than another .
everyone is equally affected by this .
do european countries and agencies work well together on this issue ? how can international cooperation be improved ?
in recent years , a number of different measures against child pornography were undertaken , and various alliances and groups were formed .
for example at interpol in lyon or europol in the hague .
also there is a tight connection between central german organizations , like the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , and their counterparts in london or paris .
and then , there are regular international conferences to discuss experiences and share information .
of course , it could all be improved upon .
but politicians are working on it , trying to harmonize certain things .
like the laws in various countries .
every country does n't apply the same laws to child sex offenses .
so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .
but now this has changed .
people recognize something must be done .
and i see that people are working very hard to protect children .
that 's what the goal of this work really is : to scare off potential child pornographers and protect children .
can individuals do anything to protect their children from becoming victims of internet related sex abuse ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in chat rooms can become prey for sex predators it is very important that parents and teachers learn how to use the media .
many teachers and parents just throw up their hands and say , " i do n't know how to use this ; you do it . "
they leave it up to the child to use the media .
so the children wind up in chat rooms where they think they are chatting with people of their own age .
but there are actually a lot of men there who are much older .
they claim to be young .
they make dates to meet , exchange phone numbers .
and then the date turns out to be a sexual assault .
teachers and parents really need to be aware of this .
there are too many people who still do n't know about it .
they should keep an eye on who their children know , who they are meeting , where and when . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .
for something to be considered child pornography , it involves the sexual portrayal of a child - that is , according to german law , a person under age 14 .
the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .
they do n't know how they can manage from one day to the next .
and the child is then sold to sex criminals who film their acts and sometimes go on to sell these images .
are there certain areas within europe where the problems are greatest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international cooperation is crucial in identifying perpetrators and sexual exploitation victims no , there is no part of europe that is particularly more active than another .
everyone is equally affected by this .
do european countries and agencies work well together on this issue ? how can international cooperation be improved ?
in recent years , a number of different measures against child pornography were undertaken , and various alliances and groups were formed .
for example at interpol in lyon or europol in the hague .
also there is a tight connection between central german organizations , like the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , and their counterparts in london or paris .
and then , there are regular international conferences to discuss experiences and share information .
of course , it could all be improved upon .
but politicians are working on it , trying to harmonize certain things .
like the laws in various countries .
every country does n't apply the same laws to child sex offenses .
so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .
but now this has changed .
people recognize something must be done .
and i see that people are working very hard to protect children .
that 's what the goal of this work really is : to scare off potential child pornographers and protect children .
can individuals do anything to protect their children from becoming victims of internet related sex abuse ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in chat rooms can become prey for sex predators it is very important that parents and teachers learn how to use the media .
many teachers and parents just throw up their hands and say , " i do n't know how to use this ; you do it . "
they leave it up to the child to use the media .
so the children wind up in chat rooms where they think they are chatting with people of their own age .
but there are actually a lot of men there who are much older .
they claim to be young .
they make dates to meet , exchange phone numbers .
and then the date turns out to be a sexual assault .
teachers and parents really need to be aware of this .
there are too many people who still do n't know about it .
they should keep an eye on who their children know , who they are meeting , where and when . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .
for something to be considered child pornography , it involves the sexual portrayal of a child - that is , according to german law , a person under age 14 .
the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .
they do n't know how they can manage from one day to the next .
and the child is then sold to sex criminals who film their acts and sometimes go on to sell these images .
are there certain areas within europe where the problems are greatest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international cooperation is crucial in identifying perpetrators and sexual exploitation victims no , there is no part of europe that is particularly more active than another .
everyone is equally affected by this .
do european countries and agencies work well together on this issue ? how can international cooperation be improved ?
in recent years , a number of different measures against child pornography were undertaken , and various alliances and groups were formed .
for example at interpol in lyon or europol in the hague .
also there is a tight connection between central german organizations , like the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , and their counterparts in london or paris .
and then , there are regular international conferences to discuss experiences and share information .
of course , it could all be improved upon .
but politicians are working on it , trying to harmonize certain things .
like the laws in various countries .
every country does n't apply the same laws to child sex offenses .
so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .
but now this has changed .
people recognize something must be done .

right-wing extremism and unemployment are the region 's biggest problems . the government warned that the presence of right-wing extremist parties was growing in eastern germany 's regional parliaments and could have implications for the economy .
" such tendencies are capable of negatively influencing the further development of the new -lsb- german -rsb- states , " wrote transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in the annual report on eastern german development , which he presented on wednesday , sept .
19 , in berlin .
the report said extreme right-wing parties had received mandates in regional parliaments as a result of a lack of democratic convictions and extreme right-wing beliefs which stemmed from a lack of democratic experience and not adequately facing up to german history .
extreme right-wing parties are represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony , which are all in germany 's east , as well as in bremen , in western germany .
" it is , however , clear to the majority of the people in eastern germany that the new states can only successfully pursue the pertinent economic and social route as a cosmopolitan and tolerant region , " the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee tiefensee , whose mandate includes eastern german development , called for more social cohesion , stressing the need for a lively society .
" this is ... important in order to deprive anti-democratic , radical right-wing and xenophobic tendencies of their breeding ground , " he said .
no end in sight to subsidies eastern germany 's economy still ca n't survive without government aid , and it will continue to be aid-dependant for years , the minister explained . " i think we will still have to calculate in categories of ten to 15 , 20 years , " he told public tv channel ard on wednesday .
but things are gradually improving .
tiefensee said the region 's economy grew last year by 3 percent , the highest growth rate since the mid-1990s .
during the same time , western germany 's economy grew by 2.7 percent , he said .
still , unemployment in the east , at an average of 14.7 percent , was twice as high as in the country 's west , tiefensee said .
however , the number of those without jobs in eastern germany dropped in 2006 compared to the previous year by 134,000 to 1.48 million .
the opposition green party was critical of tiefensee 's comments .
" at this speed , in 100 years we will have equal standards of living in east and west , " said parliamentarian peter hettlich . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

right-wing extremism and unemployment are the region 's biggest problems . the government warned that the presence of right-wing extremist parties was growing in eastern germany 's regional parliaments and could have implications for the economy .
" such tendencies are capable of negatively influencing the further development of the new -lsb- german -rsb- states , " wrote transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in the annual report on eastern german development , which he presented on wednesday , sept .
19 , in berlin .
the report said extreme right-wing parties had received mandates in regional parliaments as a result of a lack of democratic convictions and extreme right-wing beliefs which stemmed from a lack of democratic experience and not adequately facing up to german history .
extreme right-wing parties are represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony , which are all in germany 's east , as well as in bremen , in western germany .

" i think we will still have to calculate in categories of ten to 15 , 20 years , " he told public tv channel ard on wednesday .
but things are gradually improving .
tiefensee said the region 's economy grew last year by 3 percent , the highest growth rate since the mid-1990s .
during the same time , western germany 's economy grew by 2.7 percent , he said .
still , unemployment in the east , at an average of 14.7 percent , was twice as high as in the country 's west , tiefensee said .
however , the number of those without jobs in eastern germany dropped in 2006 compared to the previous year by 134,000 to 1.48 million .

when the eu introduced a directive five years ago aimed at reducing noise levels in the workplace , symphony orchestras were not covered by it .
starting next year , this will change .
will beethoven never sound the same ? " it ca n't work in symphony orchestras , " libor pesek , conductor of the prague symphony told ap news agency , referring to the eu noise directive .
" how could you apply it to gustav mahler , for instance , or richard strauss ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras may have to adjust to the new eu directive the thrust of the eu noise directive is aimed at protecting workers who are constantly exposed to high noise levels in places like construction sites or factories .
but that is not to say that classical music does n't have its victims .
a rare african okapi from the copenhagen zoo dropped dead in 1994 after opera singers exercised their joy of loud singing during open-air rehearsals in a nearby park .
" workplaces where workers are likely to be exposed to noise ... shall be marked with appropriate signs , " an excerpt from the eu directive reads .
" the areas in question shall also be delimited and access to them restricted . "
that may prove difficult with a symphony orchestra where noise is not simply an unwilling production side effect , but very much an essential part of the product .
considering that the maximum noise limit allowed by the eu is set at 85 decibels on an average work day , some fear that that the implementation of the noise directive could take all the fun out of fortissimos that decorate the music scores by tchaikovsky , stravinsky & co .

even the violins - the instruments whose sweet , mellifluous sound usually accompanies the long-awaited declaration of love in a hollywood romantic comedy - can get pretty loud , registering 109 decibels .
which is why - at least in terms of their decibel levels - power drills sometimes sound like lullabies when compared to the force of a symphony orchestra .
alison reid wright , a noise expert who has worked with british orchestras , told ap that large ensembles are already readjusting their programs to conform with the directive .
" they would n't take a large noisy piece to a small venue , " she said .
" and some orchestras have been trying to balance the noise by offsetting a very powerful piece by less powerful pieces . "
too late ?
others , she said , might follow the example of an australian opera orchestra , which decided a few years ago to use " one set of musicians for the first half and another set for the second half " to protect their hearing .
exactly how the directive will be implemented remains to be see , but once it comes into force for the music and entertainment sectors on feb .
15 , 2008 .
if a noise abatement directive had existed in the 19th century , perhaps beethoven would n't have gone deaf .

when the eu introduced a directive five years ago aimed at reducing noise levels in the workplace , symphony orchestras were not covered by it .
starting next year , this will change .
will beethoven never sound the same ? " it ca n't work in symphony orchestras , " libor pesek , conductor of the prague symphony told ap news agency , referring to the eu noise directive .
" how could you apply it to gustav mahler , for instance , or richard strauss ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras may have to adjust to the new eu directive the thrust of the eu noise directive is aimed at protecting workers who are constantly exposed to high noise levels in places like construction sites or factories .
but that is not to say that classical music does n't have its victims .
a rare african okapi from the copenhagen zoo dropped dead in 1994 after opera singers exercised their joy of loud singing during open-air rehearsals in a nearby park .
" workplaces where workers are likely to be exposed to noise ... shall be marked with appropriate signs , " an excerpt from the eu directive reads .
" the areas in question shall also be delimited and access to them restricted . "
that may prove difficult with a symphony orchestra where noise is not simply an unwilling production side effect , but very much an essential part of the product .
considering that the maximum noise limit allowed by the eu is set at 85 decibels on an average work day , some fear that that the implementation of the noise directive could take all the fun out of fortissimos that decorate the music scores by tchaikovsky , stravinsky & co .
getting loud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some instruments are born more powerful than others trumpets are known to push out 110 decibels , tubas 110 and trombones 108 during peak moments of wagner 's operas .
even the violins - the instruments whose sweet , mellifluous sound usually accompanies the long-awaited declaration of love in a hollywood romantic comedy - can get pretty loud , registering 109 decibels .
which is why - at least in terms of their decibel levels - power drills sometimes sound like lullabies when compared to the force of a symphony orchestra .
alison reid wright , a noise expert who has worked with british orchestras , told ap that large ensembles are already readjusting their programs to conform with the directive .
" they would n't take a large noisy piece to a small venue , " she said .
" and some orchestras have been trying to balance the noise by offsetting a very powerful piece by less powerful pieces . "
too late ?
others , she said , might follow the example of an australian opera orchestra , which decided a few years ago to use " one set of musicians for the first half and another set for the second half " to protect their hearing .
exactly how the directive will be implemented remains to be see , but once it comes into force for the music and entertainment sectors on feb .
15 , 2008 .
if a noise abatement directive had existed in the 19th century , perhaps beethoven would n't have gone deaf .
for modern-day musicians , however , the initiative may come too late .
" we 're all deaf anyway , " pesek said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , to vote in favor of prolonging the german army 's mandate in the realm of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan as well as that of its six tornado reconnaissance jets , which currently assist the mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pulling out troops now would reverse progress already made , steinmeier said " anyone who demands withdrawal of the troops from afghanistan puts at risk everything that we have built up in the last six years , " the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- said , though he conceded that " the way has been harder than many of us had hoped . "
the spd , chancellor angela merkel 's christian union and the free-market liberal fdp expressed their support for extending the mission in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
their combined votes are enough for the extension to be approved when lawmakers decide the issue in three weeks .
the left party 's parliamentary leader gregor gysi reiterated his party 's rejection of the mission , referring to polls that showed that a majority of germans wanted their soldiers to leave afghanistan .
greens chief appeals to afghan foreign minister germany 's green party has been in disarray over the deployment , with many members opposed to the government 's plans for the two , currently separate missions to be combined into one mandate .
green parliamentary group chief fritz kühn stressed that his party backed isaf , although most green party parliamentarians are expected to abstain or oppose the extension because they disagree with the tornado deployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanta -lrb- l . -rrb- and steinmeier in a letter to be published in the tageszeitung daily on friday , green party head claudia roth called on afghan foreign minister rangin dadfar spanta to remain a member of the political organization despite members ' disagreement over germany 's mission in his country .
spanta had previously told the paper he had written a letter of resignation from the party but was not yet entirely sure about sending it .
the minister lived in germany for some 20 years as a refugee and joined the greens in the city of aachen in 1994 .

20 , to vote in favor of prolonging the german army 's mandate in the realm of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan as well as that of its six tornado reconnaissance jets , which currently assist the mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pulling out troops now would reverse progress already made , steinmeier said " anyone who demands withdrawal of the troops from afghanistan puts at risk everything that we have built up in the last six years , " the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- said , though he conceded that " the way has been harder than many of us had hoped . "
the spd , chancellor angela merkel 's christian union and the free-market liberal fdp expressed their support for extending the mission in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
their combined votes are enough for the extension to be approved when lawmakers decide the issue in three weeks .
the left party 's parliamentary leader gregor gysi reiterated his party 's rejection of the mission , referring to polls that showed that a majority of germans wanted their soldiers to leave afghanistan .
greens chief appeals to afghan foreign minister germany 's green party has been in disarray over the deployment , with many members opposed to the government 's plans for the two , currently separate missions to be combined into one mandate .
green parliamentary group chief fritz kühn stressed that his party backed isaf , although most green party parliamentarians are expected to abstain or oppose the extension because they disagree with the tornado deployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanta -lrb- l . -rrb- and steinmeier in a letter to be published in the tageszeitung daily on friday , green party head claudia roth called on afghan foreign minister rangin dadfar spanta to remain a member of the political organization despite members ' disagreement over germany 's mission in his country .
spanta had previously told the paper he had written a letter of resignation from the party but was not yet entirely sure about sending it .

when the eu introduced a directive five years ago aimed at reducing noise levels in the workplace , symphony orchestras were not covered by it .
starting next year , this will change .
will beethoven never sound the same ? " it ca n't work in symphony orchestras , " libor pesek , conductor of the prague symphony told ap news agency , referring to the eu noise directive .
" how could you apply it to gustav mahler , for instance , or richard strauss ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras may have to adjust to the new eu directive the thrust of the eu noise directive is aimed at protecting workers who are constantly exposed to high noise levels in places like construction sites or factories .
but that is not to say that classical music does n't have its victims .
a rare african okapi from the copenhagen zoo dropped dead in 1994 after opera singers exercised their joy of loud singing during open-air rehearsals in a nearby park .
" workplaces where workers are likely to be exposed to noise ... shall be marked with appropriate signs , " an excerpt from the eu directive reads .
" the areas in question shall also be delimited and access to them restricted . "
that may prove difficult with a symphony orchestra where noise is not simply an unwilling production side effect , but very much an essential part of the product .
considering that the maximum noise limit allowed by the eu is set at 85 decibels on an average work day , some fear that that the implementation of the noise directive could take all the fun out of fortissimos that decorate the music scores by tchaikovsky , stravinsky & co .
getting loud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some instruments are born more powerful than others trumpets are known to push out 110 decibels , tubas 110 and trombones 108 during peak moments of wagner 's operas .
even the violins - the instruments whose sweet , mellifluous sound usually accompanies the long-awaited declaration of love in a hollywood romantic comedy - can get pretty loud , registering 109 decibels .
which is why - at least in terms of their decibel levels - power drills sometimes sound like lullabies when compared to the force of a symphony orchestra .
alison reid wright , a noise expert who has worked with british orchestras , told ap that large ensembles are already readjusting their programs to conform with the directive .
" they would n't take a large noisy piece to a small venue , " she said .
" and some orchestras have been trying to balance the noise by offsetting a very powerful piece by less powerful pieces . "
too late ?
others , she said , might follow the example of an australian opera orchestra , which decided a few years ago to use " one set of musicians for the first half and another set for the second half " to protect their hearing .
exactly how the directive will be implemented remains to be see , but once it comes into force for the music and entertainment sectors on feb .
15 , 2008 .
if a noise abatement directive had existed in the 19th century , perhaps beethoven would n't have gone deaf .
for modern-day musicians , however , the initiative may come too late .

when the eu introduced a directive five years ago aimed at reducing noise levels in the workplace , symphony orchestras were not covered by it .
starting next year , this will change .
will beethoven never sound the same ? " it ca n't work in symphony orchestras , " libor pesek , conductor of the prague symphony told ap news agency , referring to the eu noise directive .
" how could you apply it to gustav mahler , for instance , or richard strauss ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras may have to adjust to the new eu directive the thrust of the eu noise directive is aimed at protecting workers who are constantly exposed to high noise levels in places like construction sites or factories .
but that is not to say that classical music does n't have its victims .
a rare african okapi from the copenhagen zoo dropped dead in 1994 after opera singers exercised their joy of loud singing during open-air rehearsals in a nearby park .
" workplaces where workers are likely to be exposed to noise ... shall be marked with appropriate signs , " an excerpt from the eu directive reads .
" the areas in question shall also be delimited and access to them restricted . "
that may prove difficult with a symphony orchestra where noise is not simply an unwilling production side effect , but very much an essential part of the product .
considering that the maximum noise limit allowed by the eu is set at 85 decibels on an average work day , some fear that that the implementation of the noise directive could take all the fun out of fortissimos that decorate the music scores by tchaikovsky , stravinsky & co .
getting loud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some instruments are born more powerful than others trumpets are known to push out 110 decibels , tubas 110 and trombones 108 during peak moments of wagner 's operas .
even the violins - the instruments whose sweet , mellifluous sound usually accompanies the long-awaited declaration of love in a hollywood romantic comedy - can get pretty loud , registering 109 decibels .
which is why - at least in terms of their decibel levels - power drills sometimes sound like lullabies when compared to the force of a symphony orchestra .
alison reid wright , a noise expert who has worked with british orchestras , told ap that large ensembles are already readjusting their programs to conform with the directive .
" they would n't take a large noisy piece to a small venue , " she said .
" and some orchestras have been trying to balance the noise by offsetting a very powerful piece by less powerful pieces . "
too late ?
others , she said , might follow the example of an australian opera orchestra , which decided a few years ago to use " one set of musicians for the first half and another set for the second half " to protect their hearing .
exactly how the directive will be implemented remains to be see , but once it comes into force for the music and entertainment sectors on feb .
15 , 2008 .
if a noise abatement directive had existed in the 19th century , perhaps beethoven would n't have gone deaf .
for modern-day musicians , however , the initiative may come too late .

louis michel , eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , proposed the global alliance to help developing nations deal with and adapt to the effects of climate change .
" we need to maintain structured dialogue on tackling the effects of climate change , " he said .
" and we have to prepare developing nations for future natural disasters . "
with global warming affecting many sectors , the eu is keen to integrate " climate proofing " into poverty reduction efforts in order to ensure sustainability .
increasingly frequent , increasingly deadly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan will reduce emissions from deforestation according to the center for research on the epidemiology of disasters -lrb- cred -rrb- , the number of natural disasters recorded since 1900 is on the rise , as is the number of people affected by such disasters since 1975 .
from tsunamis in asia , hurricanes in central and north america to earthquakes in pakistan , floods in india and famine in africa , natural disasters have become increasingly frequent and increasingly deadly in recent years .
seven of the 10 worst disasters of the last 20 years occurred between 2000 and 2006 .
moreover , the eu commission is concerned that the effects of global warming are felt first and foremost by the poor and vulnerable in developing countries .
responsible for just a small percentage of global pollution themselves , they nonetheless feel the immediate effects of ecological degradation caused by industrialized and emerging nations .
while most affected by global warming , these countries also have the least capacity to deal with climate change .
" developing countries will be the hardest hit by the effects of climate change and therefore need our help to mitigate climate change and to adapt to the changes already occurring , " said this week 's commission statement .
financing a high-tech battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alert systems can help avert the worst the global climate chance alliance seeks to cut emissions from deforestation - a major contributor to rising greenhouse gas levels - and help developing countries take advantage of the global carbon market .
the commission will also fund dams and intelligent irrigation systems in order to minimize damage caused by flooding .
early warning systems for hurricanes and disaster protection program will also get financing .
brussels expects the battle against global warming to be a high-tech one .

when the eu introduced a directive five years ago aimed at reducing noise levels in the workplace , symphony orchestras were not covered by it .
starting next year , this will change .
will beethoven never sound the same ? " it ca n't work in symphony orchestras , " libor pesek , conductor of the prague symphony told ap news agency , referring to the eu noise directive .
" how could you apply it to gustav mahler , for instance , or richard strauss ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras may have to adjust to the new eu directive the thrust of the eu noise directive is aimed at protecting workers who are constantly exposed to high noise levels in places like construction sites or factories .
but that is not to say that classical music does n't have its victims .
a rare african okapi from the copenhagen zoo dropped dead in 1994 after opera singers exercised their joy of loud singing during open-air rehearsals in a nearby park .
" workplaces where workers are likely to be exposed to noise ... shall be marked with appropriate signs , " an excerpt from the eu directive reads .
" the areas in question shall also be delimited and access to them restricted . "
that may prove difficult with a symphony orchestra where noise is not simply an unwilling production side effect , but very much an essential part of the product .
considering that the maximum noise limit allowed by the eu is set at 85 decibels on an average work day , some fear that that the implementation of the noise directive could take all the fun out of fortissimos that decorate the music scores by tchaikovsky , stravinsky & co .
getting loud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some instruments are born more powerful than others trumpets are known to push out 110 decibels , tubas 110 and trombones 108 during peak moments of wagner 's operas .
even the violins - the instruments whose sweet , mellifluous sound usually accompanies the long-awaited declaration of love in a hollywood romantic comedy - can get pretty loud , registering 109 decibels .
which is why - at least in terms of their decibel levels - power drills sometimes sound like lullabies when compared to the force of a symphony orchestra .
alison reid wright , a noise expert who has worked with british orchestras , told ap that large ensembles are already readjusting their programs to conform with the directive .
" they would n't take a large noisy piece to a small venue , " she said .
" and some orchestras have been trying to balance the noise by offsetting a very powerful piece by less powerful pieces . "
too late ?
others , she said , might follow the example of an australian opera orchestra , which decided a few years ago to use " one set of musicians for the first half and another set for the second half " to protect their hearing .
exactly how the directive will be implemented remains to be see , but once it comes into force for the music and entertainment sectors on feb .
15 , 2008 .
if a noise abatement directive had existed in the 19th century , perhaps beethoven would n't have gone deaf .
for modern-day musicians , however , the initiative may come too late .

right-wing extremism and unemployment are the region 's biggest problems . the government warned that the presence of right-wing extremist parties was growing in eastern germany 's regional parliaments and could have implications for the economy .
" such tendencies are capable of negatively influencing the further development of the new -lsb- german -rsb- states , " wrote transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in the annual report on eastern german development , which he presented on wednesday , sept .
19 , in berlin .
the report said extreme right-wing parties had received mandates in regional parliaments as a result of a lack of democratic convictions and extreme right-wing beliefs which stemmed from a lack of democratic experience and not adequately facing up to german history .
extreme right-wing parties are represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony , which are all in germany 's east , as well as in bremen , in western germany .
" it is , however , clear to the majority of the people in eastern germany that the new states can only successfully pursue the pertinent economic and social route as a cosmopolitan and tolerant region , " the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee tiefensee , whose mandate includes eastern german development , called for more social cohesion , stressing the need for a lively society .
" this is ... important in order to deprive anti-democratic , radical right-wing and xenophobic tendencies of their breeding ground , " he said .
no end in sight to subsidies eastern germany 's economy still ca n't survive without government aid , and it will continue to be aid-dependant for years , the minister explained . " i think we will still have to calculate in categories of ten to 15 , 20 years , " he told public tv channel ard on wednesday .
but things are gradually improving .
tiefensee said the region 's economy grew last year by 3 percent , the highest growth rate since the mid-1990s .
during the same time , western germany 's economy grew by 2.7 percent , he said .
still , unemployment in the east , at an average of 14.7 percent , was twice as high as in the country 's west , tiefensee said .
however , the number of those without jobs in eastern germany dropped in 2006 compared to the previous year by 134,000 to 1.48 million .
the opposition green party was critical of tiefensee 's comments .

right-wing extremism and unemployment are the region 's biggest problems . the government warned that the presence of right-wing extremist parties was growing in eastern germany 's regional parliaments and could have implications for the economy .
" such tendencies are capable of negatively influencing the further development of the new -lsb- german -rsb- states , " wrote transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in the annual report on eastern german development , which he presented on wednesday , sept .
19 , in berlin .
the report said extreme right-wing parties had received mandates in regional parliaments as a result of a lack of democratic convictions and extreme right-wing beliefs which stemmed from a lack of democratic experience and not adequately facing up to german history .
extreme right-wing parties are represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony , which are all in germany 's east , as well as in bremen , in western germany .
" it is , however , clear to the majority of the people in eastern germany that the new states can only successfully pursue the pertinent economic and social route as a cosmopolitan and tolerant region , " the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee tiefensee , whose mandate includes eastern german development , called for more social cohesion , stressing the need for a lively society .
" this is ... important in order to deprive anti-democratic , radical right-wing and xenophobic tendencies of their breeding ground , " he said .
no end in sight to subsidies eastern germany 's economy still ca n't survive without government aid , and it will continue to be aid-dependant for years , the minister explained . " i think we will still have to calculate in categories of ten to 15 , 20 years , " he told public tv channel ard on wednesday .
but things are gradually improving .
tiefensee said the region 's economy grew last year by 3 percent , the highest growth rate since the mid-1990s .
during the same time , western germany 's economy grew by 2.7 percent , he said .
still , unemployment in the east , at an average of 14.7 percent , was twice as high as in the country 's west , tiefensee said .
however , the number of those without jobs in eastern germany dropped in 2006 compared to the previous year by 134,000 to 1.48 million .
the opposition green party was critical of tiefensee 's comments .

louis michel , eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , proposed the global alliance to help developing nations deal with and adapt to the effects of climate change .
" we need to maintain structured dialogue on tackling the effects of climate change , " he said .
" and we have to prepare developing nations for future natural disasters . "
with global warming affecting many sectors , the eu is keen to integrate " climate proofing " into poverty reduction efforts in order to ensure sustainability .
increasingly frequent , increasingly deadly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan will reduce emissions from deforestation according to the center for research on the epidemiology of disasters -lrb- cred -rrb- , the number of natural disasters recorded since 1900 is on the rise , as is the number of people affected by such disasters since 1975 .
from tsunamis in asia , hurricanes in central and north america to earthquakes in pakistan , floods in india and famine in africa , natural disasters have become increasingly frequent and increasingly deadly in recent years .
seven of the 10 worst disasters of the last 20 years occurred between 2000 and 2006 .
moreover , the eu commission is concerned that the effects of global warming are felt first and foremost by the poor and vulnerable in developing countries .
responsible for just a small percentage of global pollution themselves , they nonetheless feel the immediate effects of ecological degradation caused by industrialized and emerging nations .
while most affected by global warming , these countries also have the least capacity to deal with climate change .
" developing countries will be the hardest hit by the effects of climate change and therefore need our help to mitigate climate change and to adapt to the changes already occurring , " said this week 's commission statement .
financing a high-tech battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alert systems can help avert the worst the global climate chance alliance seeks to cut emissions from deforestation - a major contributor to rising greenhouse gas levels - and help developing countries take advantage of the global carbon market .
the commission will also fund dams and intelligent irrigation systems in order to minimize damage caused by flooding .
early warning systems for hurricanes and disaster protection program will also get financing .
brussels expects the battle against global warming to be a high-tech one .
" new technology is only one way of developing towards a sustainable society without hampering development and quality of life , " said the commission statement .
with 50 million euros already earmarked for the launch of the alliance , michel said it could handle up to 300 million euros between 2008 and 2010 .
" it 's just a start , " he said .
" more money is clearly needed .
other resources are necessary to respond to the scale of the needs , " he added , calling on eu member states to boosts the funds . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i propose that marriages lapse after seven years , " gabriele pauli told reporters in munich on wednesday , sept .
19 , announcing her platform for the upcoming party congress .
" this would mean that one will only commit for a fixed period and will actively have to renew your vows if you still want to continue . " with statistics showing that almost 38 percent of germans who marry today are likely to get divorced , pauli believes that putting a time constraint on the sacrament of holy matrimony would save many people the trouble and drudgery of filing the divorce papers . but making marriage sound like a business investment with an exit strategy just as the seven-year itch sets in does not win you brownie points with party officials in a center-right , catholic-dominated party .
" that 's an absurd idea and totally contrary to the program of the csu , " said german agriculture minister and csu member horst seehofer , who is also wants to become party leader .

if anybody ever decided to write a " how not to become a leader of a bavarian conservative party for dummies , " they would make the manual very useful alone by highlighting all the things that pauli did over the past year .
she emerged from obscurity at a party congress by saying out loud what most people do n't even dream of telling their priest in confession : that premier edmund stoiber - the towering giant of bavarian politics - had become a liability and that he should really think about retirement .
she then posed for glossy magazine park avenue wearing long black latex gloves that looked like they came out straight of your friendly german s & m studio next door or stretched provocatively on a massage bench .
finally , she attacked one of bavaria 's holy cows - the institution of marriage - and party leaders for having an outdated view of what marriage is like .
" for me , family is a different type of formation than for the csu , " pauli said .
" maybe people live better outside of marriage . "

" this would mean that one will only commit for a fixed period and will actively have to renew your vows if you still want to continue . " with statistics showing that almost 38 percent of germans who marry today are likely to get divorced , pauli believes that putting a time constraint on the sacrament of holy matrimony would save many people the trouble and drudgery of filing the divorce papers . but making marriage sound like a business investment with an exit strategy just as the seven-year itch sets in does not win you brownie points with party officials in a center-right , catholic-dominated party .
" that 's an absurd idea and totally contrary to the program of the csu , " said german agriculture minister and csu member horst seehofer , who is also wants to become party leader .
" we are not in a circus , " he said .
" with ideas like that , she should give up her candidacy . "
controversy , here i come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although not all csu members wear lederhosen , the party is largely conservative whether earning one 's bread as a politician is altogether that different from working in a circus is a moot point .
but gabriele pauli , district administrator in the bavarian suburban county of fürth , is no stranger to controversy .
if anybody ever decided to write a " how not to become a leader of a bavarian conservative party for dummies , " they would make the manual very useful alone by highlighting all the things that pauli did over the past year .
she emerged from obscurity at a party congress by saying out loud what most people do n't even dream of telling their priest in confession : that premier edmund stoiber - the towering giant of bavarian politics - had become a liability and that he should really think about retirement .
she then posed for glossy magazine park avenue wearing long black latex gloves that looked like they came out straight of your friendly german s & m studio next door or stretched provocatively on a massage bench .
finally , she attacked one of bavaria 's holy cows - the institution of marriage - and party leaders for having an outdated view of what marriage is like .
" for me , family is a different type of formation than for the csu , " pauli said .
" maybe people live better outside of marriage . "
what next ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could gabriele pauli be the next edmund stoiber ?
it is safe to assume at this point that gabriele pauli 's future in the pious csu does not look very promising .

the german government announced it would pay compensation to some 50,000 workers in nazi germany 's jewish ghettos who previously failed to qualify for payouts from a fund for former slave laborers . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said on wednesday , sept 19 , that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved a finance ministry plan to award one-off payments of 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,789 -rrb- to those who have not yet received compensation from the holocaust memorial fund .
" the payment agreed today is not compensation for being interned in ghettos ... it is a humanitarian gesture , " wilhelm told reporters in berlin , stressing that it was aimed at people who did not receive compensation from a separate settlement created in 2000 that had paid out a total of 4.4 billion euros to survivors of the nazis ' forced labor programs . with merkel eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible , the announcement comes after weeks of discussion between german finance ministry officials and israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafi eitan . germany allegedly wanted to pay some 700 euros per person less , but israel insisted the offer was too low . a drawn out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision will apply to some 50,000 ghetto survivors compensation for ghetto workers , whose wages would have been negligible , is one of the last outstanding compensation claims dating back to hitler 's third reich .
the issue has long been the subject of negotiations with the new york-based jewish claims conference , which obtains compensation for holocaust survivors .
in germany , the setting up of the fund to compensate slave laborers was overshadowed by legal wrangling about contributions from companies which profited from the nazis ' labor policies during the third reich .
former slave laborers and their surviving relatives in over 100 countries received payouts from that fund , whose administrators announced in july that they had completed their task .
forgotten ghetto survivors in 2002 , the german parliament passed a law to grant the ghetto survivors a small pension , but the plan failed due to bureaucratic difficulties processing the claims .
the finance ministry said the government estimated there were still around 50,000 people eligible to claim the payment .
" the aim is to get the payment to the elderly applicants as quickly and as unbureaucratically as possible , " the ministry said , advising that applications could be made immediately to germany 's federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in bonn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the payment agreed today is not compensation for being interned in ghettos ... it is a humanitarian gesture , " wilhelm told reporters in berlin , stressing that it was aimed at people who did not receive compensation from a separate settlement created in 2000 that had paid out a total of 4.4 billion euros to survivors of the nazis ' forced labor programs . with merkel eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible , the announcement comes after weeks of discussion between german finance ministry officials and israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafi eitan . germany allegedly wanted to pay some 700 euros per person less , but israel insisted the offer was too low . a drawn out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision will apply to some 50,000 ghetto survivors compensation for ghetto workers , whose wages would have been negligible , is one of the last outstanding compensation claims dating back to hitler 's third reich .
the issue has long been the subject of negotiations with the new york-based jewish claims conference , which obtains compensation for holocaust survivors .
in germany , the setting up of the fund to compensate slave laborers was overshadowed by legal wrangling about contributions from companies which profited from the nazis ' labor policies during the third reich .
former slave laborers and their surviving relatives in over 100 countries received payouts from that fund , whose administrators announced in july that they had completed their task .
forgotten ghetto survivors in 2002 , the german parliament passed a law to grant the ghetto survivors a small pension , but the plan failed due to bureaucratic difficulties processing the claims .
the finance ministry said the government estimated there were still around 50,000 people eligible to claim the payment .
" the aim is to get the payment to the elderly applicants as quickly and as unbureaucratically as possible , " the ministry said , advising that applications could be made immediately to germany 's federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in bonn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when the eu introduced a directive five years ago aimed at reducing noise levels in the workplace , symphony orchestras were not covered by it .
starting next year , this will change .
will beethoven never sound the same ? " it ca n't work in symphony orchestras , " libor pesek , conductor of the prague symphony told ap news agency , referring to the eu noise directive .
" how could you apply it to gustav mahler , for instance , or richard strauss ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras may have to adjust to the new eu directive the thrust of the eu noise directive is aimed at protecting workers who are constantly exposed to high noise levels in places like construction sites or factories .
but that is not to say that classical music does n't have its victims .
a rare african okapi from the copenhagen zoo dropped dead in 1994 after opera singers exercised their joy of loud singing during open-air rehearsals in a nearby park .
" workplaces where workers are likely to be exposed to noise ... shall be marked with appropriate signs , " an excerpt from the eu directive reads .
" the areas in question shall also be delimited and access to them restricted . "
that may prove difficult with a symphony orchestra where noise is not simply an unwilling production side effect , but very much an essential part of the product .
considering that the maximum noise limit allowed by the eu is set at 85 decibels on an average work day , some fear that that the implementation of the noise directive could take all the fun out of fortissimos that decorate the music scores by tchaikovsky , stravinsky & co .
getting loud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some instruments are born more powerful than others trumpets are known to push out 110 decibels , tubas 110 and trombones 108 during peak moments of wagner 's operas .
even the violins - the instruments whose sweet , mellifluous sound usually accompanies the long-awaited declaration of love in a hollywood romantic comedy - can get pretty loud , registering 109 decibels .
which is why - at least in terms of their decibel levels - power drills sometimes sound like lullabies when compared to the force of a symphony orchestra .
alison reid wright , a noise expert who has worked with british orchestras , told ap that large ensembles are already readjusting their programs to conform with the directive .
" they would n't take a large noisy piece to a small venue , " she said .
" and some orchestras have been trying to balance the noise by offsetting a very powerful piece by less powerful pieces . "
too late ?
others , she said , might follow the example of an australian opera orchestra , which decided a few years ago to use " one set of musicians for the first half and another set for the second half " to protect their hearing .
exactly how the directive will be implemented remains to be see , but once it comes into force for the music and entertainment sectors on feb .
15 , 2008 .
if a noise abatement directive had existed in the 19th century , perhaps beethoven would n't have gone deaf .
for modern-day musicians , however , the initiative may come too late .

" workplaces where workers are likely to be exposed to noise ... shall be marked with appropriate signs , " an excerpt from the eu directive reads .
" the areas in question shall also be delimited and access to them restricted . "
that may prove difficult with a symphony orchestra where noise is not simply an unwilling production side effect , but very much an essential part of the product .

the german government announced it would pay compensation to some 50,000 workers in nazi germany 's jewish ghettos who previously failed to qualify for payouts from a fund for former slave laborers . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said on wednesday , sept 19 , that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved a finance ministry plan to award one-off payments of 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,789 -rrb- to those who have not yet received compensation from the holocaust memorial fund .
" the payment agreed today is not compensation for being interned in ghettos ... it is a humanitarian gesture , " wilhelm told reporters in berlin , stressing that it was aimed at people who did not receive compensation from a separate settlement created in 2000 that had paid out a total of 4.4 billion euros to survivors of the nazis ' forced labor programs . with merkel eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible , the announcement comes after weeks of discussion between german finance ministry officials and israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafi eitan . germany allegedly wanted to pay some 700 euros per person less , but israel insisted the offer was too low . a drawn out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision will apply to some 50,000 ghetto survivors compensation for ghetto workers , whose wages would have been negligible , is one of the last outstanding compensation claims dating back to hitler 's third reich .
the issue has long been the subject of negotiations with the new york-based jewish claims conference , which obtains compensation for holocaust survivors .
in germany , the setting up of the fund to compensate slave laborers was overshadowed by legal wrangling about contributions from companies which profited from the nazis ' labor policies during the third reich .
former slave laborers and their surviving relatives in over 100 countries received payouts from that fund , whose administrators announced in july that they had completed their task .
forgotten ghetto survivors in 2002 , the german parliament passed a law to grant the ghetto survivors a small pension , but the plan failed due to bureaucratic difficulties processing the claims .
the finance ministry said the government estimated there were still around 50,000 people eligible to claim the payment .
" the aim is to get the payment to the elderly applicants as quickly and as unbureaucratically as possible , " the ministry said , advising that applications could be made immediately to germany 's federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in bonn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

right-wing extremism and unemployment are the region 's biggest problems . the government warned that the presence of right-wing extremist parties was growing in eastern germany 's regional parliaments and could have implications for the economy .

the report said extreme right-wing parties had received mandates in regional parliaments as a result of a lack of democratic convictions and extreme right-wing beliefs which stemmed from a lack of democratic experience and not adequately facing up to german history .
extreme right-wing parties are represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony , which are all in germany 's east , as well as in bremen , in western germany .

no end in sight to subsidies eastern germany 's economy still ca n't survive without government aid , and it will continue to be aid-dependant for years , the minister explained . " i think we will still have to calculate in categories of ten to 15 , 20 years , " he told public tv channel ard on wednesday .
but things are gradually improving .
tiefensee said the region 's economy grew last year by 3 percent , the highest growth rate since the mid-1990s .
during the same time , western germany 's economy grew by 2.7 percent , he said .
still , unemployment in the east , at an average of 14.7 percent , was twice as high as in the country 's west , tiefensee said .
however , the number of those without jobs in eastern germany dropped in 2006 compared to the previous year by 134,000 to 1.48 million .

right-wing extremism and unemployment are the region 's biggest problems . the government warned that the presence of right-wing extremist parties was growing in eastern germany 's regional parliaments and could have implications for the economy .
" such tendencies are capable of negatively influencing the further development of the new -lsb- german -rsb- states , " wrote transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in the annual report on eastern german development , which he presented on wednesday , sept .
19 , in berlin .
the report said extreme right-wing parties had received mandates in regional parliaments as a result of a lack of democratic convictions and extreme right-wing beliefs which stemmed from a lack of democratic experience and not adequately facing up to german history .
extreme right-wing parties are represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony , which are all in germany 's east , as well as in bremen , in western germany .
" it is , however , clear to the majority of the people in eastern germany that the new states can only successfully pursue the pertinent economic and social route as a cosmopolitan and tolerant region , " the report said .

louis michel , eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , proposed the global alliance to help developing nations deal with and adapt to the effects of climate change .
" we need to maintain structured dialogue on tackling the effects of climate change , " he said .
" and we have to prepare developing nations for future natural disasters . "
with global warming affecting many sectors , the eu is keen to integrate " climate proofing " into poverty reduction efforts in order to ensure sustainability .
increasingly frequent , increasingly deadly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan will reduce emissions from deforestation according to the center for research on the epidemiology of disasters -lrb- cred -rrb- , the number of natural disasters recorded since 1900 is on the rise , as is the number of people affected by such disasters since 1975 .
from tsunamis in asia , hurricanes in central and north america to earthquakes in pakistan , floods in india and famine in africa , natural disasters have become increasingly frequent and increasingly deadly in recent years .
seven of the 10 worst disasters of the last 20 years occurred between 2000 and 2006 .
moreover , the eu commission is concerned that the effects of global warming are felt first and foremost by the poor and vulnerable in developing countries .
responsible for just a small percentage of global pollution themselves , they nonetheless feel the immediate effects of ecological degradation caused by industrialized and emerging nations .
while most affected by global warming , these countries also have the least capacity to deal with climate change .
" developing countries will be the hardest hit by the effects of climate change and therefore need our help to mitigate climate change and to adapt to the changes already occurring , " said this week 's commission statement .
financing a high-tech battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alert systems can help avert the worst the global climate chance alliance seeks to cut emissions from deforestation - a major contributor to rising greenhouse gas levels - and help developing countries take advantage of the global carbon market .
the commission will also fund dams and intelligent irrigation systems in order to minimize damage caused by flooding .
early warning systems for hurricanes and disaster protection program will also get financing .
brussels expects the battle against global warming to be a high-tech one .
" new technology is only one way of developing towards a sustainable society without hampering development and quality of life , " said the commission statement .
with 50 million euros already earmarked for the launch of the alliance , michel said it could handle up to 300 million euros between 2008 and 2010 .
" it 's just a start , " he said .
" more money is clearly needed .
other resources are necessary to respond to the scale of the needs , " he added , calling on eu member states to boosts the funds . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

right-wing extremism and unemployment are the region 's biggest problems . the government warned that the presence of right-wing extremist parties was growing in eastern germany 's regional parliaments and could have implications for the economy .
" such tendencies are capable of negatively influencing the further development of the new -lsb- german -rsb- states , " wrote transport minister wolfgang tiefensee in the annual report on eastern german development , which he presented on wednesday , sept .
19 , in berlin .
the report said extreme right-wing parties had received mandates in regional parliaments as a result of a lack of democratic convictions and extreme right-wing beliefs which stemmed from a lack of democratic experience and not adequately facing up to german history .
extreme right-wing parties are represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , saxony , which are all in germany 's east , as well as in bremen , in western germany .
" it is , however , clear to the majority of the people in eastern germany that the new states can only successfully pursue the pertinent economic and social route as a cosmopolitan and tolerant region , " the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee tiefensee , whose mandate includes eastern german development , called for more social cohesion , stressing the need for a lively society .
" this is ... important in order to deprive anti-democratic , radical right-wing and xenophobic tendencies of their breeding ground , " he said .
no end in sight to subsidies eastern germany 's economy still ca n't survive without government aid , and it will continue to be aid-dependant for years , the minister explained . " i think we will still have to calculate in categories of ten to 15 , 20 years , " he told public tv channel ard on wednesday .
but things are gradually improving .
tiefensee said the region 's economy grew last year by 3 percent , the highest growth rate since the mid-1990s .
during the same time , western germany 's economy grew by 2.7 percent , he said .
still , unemployment in the east , at an average of 14.7 percent , was twice as high as in the country 's west , tiefensee said .
however , the number of those without jobs in eastern germany dropped in 2006 compared to the previous year by 134,000 to 1.48 million .
the opposition green party was critical of tiefensee 's comments .
" at this speed , in 100 years we will have equal standards of living in east and west , " said parliamentarian peter hettlich . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i propose that marriages lapse after seven years , " gabriele pauli told reporters in munich on wednesday , sept .
19 , announcing her platform for the upcoming party congress .
" this would mean that one will only commit for a fixed period and will actively have to renew your vows if you still want to continue . " with statistics showing that almost 38 percent of germans who marry today are likely to get divorced , pauli believes that putting a time constraint on the sacrament of holy matrimony would save many people the trouble and drudgery of filing the divorce papers . but making marriage sound like a business investment with an exit strategy just as the seven-year itch sets in does not win you brownie points with party officials in a center-right , catholic-dominated party .
" that 's an absurd idea and totally contrary to the program of the csu , " said german agriculture minister and csu member horst seehofer , who is also wants to become party leader .
" we are not in a circus , " he said .
" with ideas like that , she should give up her candidacy . "
controversy , here i come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although not all csu members wear lederhosen , the party is largely conservative whether earning one 's bread as a politician is altogether that different from working in a circus is a moot point .
but gabriele pauli , district administrator in the bavarian suburban county of fürth , is no stranger to controversy .
if anybody ever decided to write a " how not to become a leader of a bavarian conservative party for dummies , " they would make the manual very useful alone by highlighting all the things that pauli did over the past year .
she emerged from obscurity at a party congress by saying out loud what most people do n't even dream of telling their priest in confession : that premier edmund stoiber - the towering giant of bavarian politics - had become a liability and that he should really think about retirement .
she then posed for glossy magazine park avenue wearing long black latex gloves that looked like they came out straight of your friendly german s & m studio next door or stretched provocatively on a massage bench .
finally , she attacked one of bavaria 's holy cows - the institution of marriage - and party leaders for having an outdated view of what marriage is like .
" for me , family is a different type of formation than for the csu , " pauli said .
" maybe people live better outside of marriage . "

it is safe to assume at this point that gabriele pauli 's future in the pious csu does not look very promising .

with her phd in political science and no shame when it comes to media exposure , pauli could move on to bigger and better things .
one never knows what to expect from vampy conservatives .

the german government announced it would pay compensation to some 50,000 workers in nazi germany 's jewish ghettos who previously failed to qualify for payouts from a fund for former slave laborers . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said on wednesday , sept 19 , that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved a finance ministry plan to award one-off payments of 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,789 -rrb- to those who have not yet received compensation from the holocaust memorial fund .
" the payment agreed today is not compensation for being interned in ghettos ... it is a humanitarian gesture , " wilhelm told reporters in berlin , stressing that it was aimed at people who did not receive compensation from a separate settlement created in 2000 that had paid out a total of 4.4 billion euros to survivors of the nazis ' forced labor programs . with merkel eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible , the announcement comes after weeks of discussion between german finance ministry officials and israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafi eitan . germany allegedly wanted to pay some 700 euros per person less , but israel insisted the offer was too low . a drawn out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision will apply to some 50,000 ghetto survivors compensation for ghetto workers , whose wages would have been negligible , is one of the last outstanding compensation claims dating back to hitler 's third reich .
the issue has long been the subject of negotiations with the new york-based jewish claims conference , which obtains compensation for holocaust survivors .
in germany , the setting up of the fund to compensate slave laborers was overshadowed by legal wrangling about contributions from companies which profited from the nazis ' labor policies during the third reich .
former slave laborers and their surviving relatives in over 100 countries received payouts from that fund , whose administrators announced in july that they had completed their task .
forgotten ghetto survivors in 2002 , the german parliament passed a law to grant the ghetto survivors a small pension , but the plan failed due to bureaucratic difficulties processing the claims .
the finance ministry said the government estimated there were still around 50,000 people eligible to claim the payment .
" the aim is to get the payment to the elderly applicants as quickly and as unbureaucratically as possible , " the ministry said , advising that applications could be made immediately to germany 's federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in bonn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , to vote in favor of prolonging the german army 's mandate in the realm of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan as well as that of its six tornado reconnaissance jets , which currently assist the mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pulling out troops now would reverse progress already made , steinmeier said " anyone who demands withdrawal of the troops from afghanistan puts at risk everything that we have built up in the last six years , " the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- said , though he conceded that " the way has been harder than many of us had hoped . "
the spd , chancellor angela merkel 's christian union and the free-market liberal fdp expressed their support for extending the mission in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
their combined votes are enough for the extension to be approved when lawmakers decide the issue in three weeks .
the left party 's parliamentary leader gregor gysi reiterated his party 's rejection of the mission , referring to polls that showed that a majority of germans wanted their soldiers to leave afghanistan .
greens chief appeals to afghan foreign minister germany 's green party has been in disarray over the deployment , with many members opposed to the government 's plans for the two , currently separate missions to be combined into one mandate .
green parliamentary group chief fritz kühn stressed that his party backed isaf , although most green party parliamentarians are expected to abstain or oppose the extension because they disagree with the tornado deployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanta -lrb- l . -rrb- and steinmeier in a letter to be published in the tageszeitung daily on friday , green party head claudia roth called on afghan foreign minister rangin dadfar spanta to remain a member of the political organization despite members ' disagreement over germany 's mission in his country .
spanta had previously told the paper he had written a letter of resignation from the party but was not yet entirely sure about sending it .
the minister lived in germany for some 20 years as a refugee and joined the greens in the city of aachen in 1994 .

" the payment agreed today is not compensation for being interned in ghettos ... it is a humanitarian gesture , " wilhelm told reporters in berlin , stressing that it was aimed at people who did not receive compensation from a separate settlement created in 2000 that had paid out a total of 4.4 billion euros to survivors of the nazis ' forced labor programs . with merkel eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible , the announcement comes after weeks of discussion between german finance ministry officials and israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafi eitan . germany allegedly wanted to pay some 700 euros per person less , but israel insisted the offer was too low . a drawn out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision will apply to some 50,000 ghetto survivors compensation for ghetto workers , whose wages would have been negligible , is one of the last outstanding compensation claims dating back to hitler 's third reich .
the issue has long been the subject of negotiations with the new york-based jewish claims conference , which obtains compensation for holocaust survivors .
in germany , the setting up of the fund to compensate slave laborers was overshadowed by legal wrangling about contributions from companies which profited from the nazis ' labor policies during the third reich .
former slave laborers and their surviving relatives in over 100 countries received payouts from that fund , whose administrators announced in july that they had completed their task .
forgotten ghetto survivors in 2002 , the german parliament passed a law to grant the ghetto survivors a small pension , but the plan failed due to bureaucratic difficulties processing the claims .
the finance ministry said the government estimated there were still around 50,000 people eligible to claim the payment .
" the aim is to get the payment to the elderly applicants as quickly and as unbureaucratically as possible , " the ministry said , advising that applications could be made immediately to germany 's federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in bonn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .
for something to be considered child pornography , it involves the sexual portrayal of a child - that is , according to german law , a person under age 14 .
the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .
they do n't know how they can manage from one day to the next .
and the child is then sold to sex criminals who film their acts and sometimes go on to sell these images .
are there certain areas within europe where the problems are greatest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international cooperation is crucial in identifying perpetrators and sexual exploitation victims no , there is no part of europe that is particularly more active than another .
everyone is equally affected by this .
do european countries and agencies work well together on this issue ? how can international cooperation be improved ?
in recent years , a number of different measures against child pornography were undertaken , and various alliances and groups were formed .
for example at interpol in lyon or europol in the hague .
also there is a tight connection between central german organizations , like the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , and their counterparts in london or paris .
and then , there are regular international conferences to discuss experiences and share information .
of course , it could all be improved upon .
but politicians are working on it , trying to harmonize certain things .
like the laws in various countries .
every country does n't apply the same laws to child sex offenses .
so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .
but now this has changed .
people recognize something must be done .
and i see that people are working very hard to protect children .
that 's what the goal of this work really is : to scare off potential child pornographers and protect children .
can individuals do anything to protect their children from becoming victims of internet related sex abuse ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in chat rooms can become prey for sex predators it is very important that parents and teachers learn how to use the media .
many teachers and parents just throw up their hands and say , " i do n't know how to use this ; you do it . "
they leave it up to the child to use the media .
so the children wind up in chat rooms where they think they are chatting with people of their own age .
but there are actually a lot of men there who are much older .
they claim to be young .
they make dates to meet , exchange phone numbers .
and then the date turns out to be a sexual assault .
teachers and parents really need to be aware of this .
there are too many people who still do n't know about it .
they should keep an eye on who their children know , who they are meeting , where and when . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .
for something to be considered child pornography , it involves the sexual portrayal of a child - that is , according to german law , a person under age 14 .
the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .
they do n't know how they can manage from one day to the next .
and the child is then sold to sex criminals who film their acts and sometimes go on to sell these images .
are there certain areas within europe where the problems are greatest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international cooperation is crucial in identifying perpetrators and sexual exploitation victims no , there is no part of europe that is particularly more active than another .
everyone is equally affected by this .
do european countries and agencies work well together on this issue ? how can international cooperation be improved ?
in recent years , a number of different measures against child pornography were undertaken , and various alliances and groups were formed .
for example at interpol in lyon or europol in the hague .
also there is a tight connection between central german organizations , like the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , and their counterparts in london or paris .
and then , there are regular international conferences to discuss experiences and share information .
of course , it could all be improved upon .
but politicians are working on it , trying to harmonize certain things .
like the laws in various countries .
every country does n't apply the same laws to child sex offenses .
so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .
but now this has changed .
people recognize something must be done .
and i see that people are working very hard to protect children .
that 's what the goal of this work really is : to scare off potential child pornographers and protect children .
can individuals do anything to protect their children from becoming victims of internet related sex abuse ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in chat rooms can become prey for sex predators it is very important that parents and teachers learn how to use the media .
many teachers and parents just throw up their hands and say , " i do n't know how to use this ; you do it . "
they leave it up to the child to use the media .
so the children wind up in chat rooms where they think they are chatting with people of their own age .
but there are actually a lot of men there who are much older .
they claim to be young .
they make dates to meet , exchange phone numbers .
and then the date turns out to be a sexual assault .
teachers and parents really need to be aware of this .
there are too many people who still do n't know about it .
they should keep an eye on who their children know , who they are meeting , where and when . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .
for something to be considered child pornography , it involves the sexual portrayal of a child - that is , according to german law , a person under age 14 .
the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .
they do n't know how they can manage from one day to the next .
and the child is then sold to sex criminals who film their acts and sometimes go on to sell these images .
are there certain areas within europe where the problems are greatest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international cooperation is crucial in identifying perpetrators and sexual exploitation victims no , there is no part of europe that is particularly more active than another .
everyone is equally affected by this .
do european countries and agencies work well together on this issue ? how can international cooperation be improved ?
in recent years , a number of different measures against child pornography were undertaken , and various alliances and groups were formed .
for example at interpol in lyon or europol in the hague .
also there is a tight connection between central german organizations , like the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , and their counterparts in london or paris .
and then , there are regular international conferences to discuss experiences and share information .
of course , it could all be improved upon .
but politicians are working on it , trying to harmonize certain things .
like the laws in various countries .
every country does n't apply the same laws to child sex offenses .
so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .
but now this has changed .
people recognize something must be done .
and i see that people are working very hard to protect children .
that 's what the goal of this work really is : to scare off potential child pornographers and protect children .
can individuals do anything to protect their children from becoming victims of internet related sex abuse ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in chat rooms can become prey for sex predators it is very important that parents and teachers learn how to use the media .
many teachers and parents just throw up their hands and say , " i do n't know how to use this ; you do it . "
they leave it up to the child to use the media .
so the children wind up in chat rooms where they think they are chatting with people of their own age .
but there are actually a lot of men there who are much older .
they claim to be young .
they make dates to meet , exchange phone numbers .
and then the date turns out to be a sexual assault .
teachers and parents really need to be aware of this .
there are too many people who still do n't know about it .
they should keep an eye on who their children know , who they are meeting , where and when . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.09.2007 internet home to most child sex crimes , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet porn peddlers increasingly push images of children ahead of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet , dw-world.de spoke to a german police investigator who used creative methods to crack a child pornography ring . on thursday , sept .
20 , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is holding an international conference on the topic of combating sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
the meeting aims to address the obstacles involved in investigating this growing category of crime , whose creators , providers and users are often scattered around the globe .
bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .
for something to be considered child pornography , it involves the sexual portrayal of a child - that is , according to german law , a person under age 14 .
the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .
they do n't know how they can manage from one day to the next .
and the child is then sold to sex criminals who film their acts and sometimes go on to sell these images .
are there certain areas within europe where the problems are greatest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international cooperation is crucial in identifying perpetrators and sexual exploitation victims no , there is no part of europe that is particularly more active than another .
everyone is equally affected by this .
do european countries and agencies work well together on this issue ? how can international cooperation be improved ?
in recent years , a number of different measures against child pornography were undertaken , and various alliances and groups were formed .
for example at interpol in lyon or europol in the hague .
also there is a tight connection between central german organizations , like the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , and their counterparts in london or paris .
and then , there are regular international conferences to discuss experiences and share information .
of course , it could all be improved upon .
but politicians are working on it , trying to harmonize certain things .
like the laws in various countries .
every country does n't apply the same laws to child sex offenses .
so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .
but now this has changed .
people recognize something must be done .
and i see that people are working very hard to protect children .
that 's what the goal of this work really is : to scare off potential child pornographers and protect children .
can individuals do anything to protect their children from becoming victims of internet related sex abuse ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in chat rooms can become prey for sex predators it is very important that parents and teachers learn how to use the media .
many teachers and parents just throw up their hands and say , " i do n't know how to use this ; you do it . "
they leave it up to the child to use the media .
so the children wind up in chat rooms where they think they are chatting with people of their own age .
but there are actually a lot of men there who are much older .
they claim to be young .
they make dates to meet , exchange phone numbers .
and then the date turns out to be a sexual assault .
teachers and parents really need to be aware of this .
there are too many people who still do n't know about it .
they should keep an eye on who their children know , who they are meeting , where and when . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 20.09.2007 symphonic music may suffer under eu noise directive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come on , guys , i ca n't hear you !
when the eu introduced a directive five years ago aimed at reducing noise levels in the workplace , symphony orchestras were not covered by it .
starting next year , this will change .
will beethoven never sound the same ? " it ca n't work in symphony orchestras , " libor pesek , conductor of the prague symphony told ap news agency , referring to the eu noise directive .
" how could you apply it to gustav mahler , for instance , or richard strauss ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras may have to adjust to the new eu directive the thrust of the eu noise directive is aimed at protecting workers who are constantly exposed to high noise levels in places like construction sites or factories .
but that is not to say that classical music does n't have its victims .
a rare african okapi from the copenhagen zoo dropped dead in 1994 after opera singers exercised their joy of loud singing during open-air rehearsals in a nearby park .
" workplaces where workers are likely to be exposed to noise ... shall be marked with appropriate signs , " an excerpt from the eu directive reads .
" the areas in question shall also be delimited and access to them restricted . "
that may prove difficult with a symphony orchestra where noise is not simply an unwilling production side effect , but very much an essential part of the product .
considering that the maximum noise limit allowed by the eu is set at 85 decibels on an average work day , some fear that that the implementation of the noise directive could take all the fun out of fortissimos that decorate the music scores by tchaikovsky , stravinsky & co .
getting loud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some instruments are born more powerful than others trumpets are known to push out 110 decibels , tubas 110 and trombones 108 during peak moments of wagner 's operas .
even the violins - the instruments whose sweet , mellifluous sound usually accompanies the long-awaited declaration of love in a hollywood romantic comedy - can get pretty loud , registering 109 decibels .
which is why - at least in terms of their decibel levels - power drills sometimes sound like lullabies when compared to the force of a symphony orchestra .
alison reid wright , a noise expert who has worked with british orchestras , told ap that large ensembles are already readjusting their programs to conform with the directive .
" they would n't take a large noisy piece to a small venue , " she said .
" and some orchestras have been trying to balance the noise by offsetting a very powerful piece by less powerful pieces . "
too late ?
others , she said , might follow the example of an australian opera orchestra , which decided a few years ago to use " one set of musicians for the first half and another set for the second half " to protect their hearing .
exactly how the directive will be implemented remains to be see , but once it comes into force for the music and entertainment sectors on feb .
15 , 2008 .
if a noise abatement directive had existed in the 19th century , perhaps beethoven would n't have gone deaf .
for modern-day musicians , however , the initiative may come too late .
" we 're all deaf anyway , " pesek said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : meyer 's " operation mikado " brought together police and credit card firms dw-world.de spoke with torsten meyer , the chief investigator in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt and an expert in the area of child sexual abuse .
earlier this year , meyer made headlines when he successfully cracked a child-pornography ring by analyzing credit card data .
his " operation mikado " located over 300 criminals who paid to access what meyer called " seriously hardcore " images on the internet .
mikado - the german name for the game " pick-up sticks " - is an apt metaphor for the investigation as sorting through the data was a delicate act , meyer said .
" we had to be careful to pick the criminals out , from this huge pile of information , one by one , without touching the others , " he said .
dw-world.de : over the years there has been a lot of talk about how the internet gives those interested in child pornography a platform to organize themselves and communicate with one another .
how important is the internet for these criminals ?
torsten meyer : the majority of crimes in this area are found on the internet . … with the data possibilities , criminals in many areas , but especially pedophiles , have the possibility to meet up , exchange ideas , and get their hands on much more material .
back when data networks were less developed , it was harder for them .
but i have to make one thing clear : child pornography and pedophilia have always existed .
the internet just makes it easier for them to create pornography .
that goes for other technologies , like digital cameras , digital video cameras .
anything with a large memory capacity can be used to make child pornography easily and quickly .
where did you get the idea for operation mikado ?
the examination of private credit card data was seen as quite controversial in terms of data privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit card analysis caught some 300 child porn users last year we got a tip from a reporter at a tv station , who told us about a child pornography site .
on the site it said that if you paid $ 79.99 -lrb- 57.67 euros -rrb- you could get access to a members ' area .
once you had access to the membership area you had 3-4 gigabytes of seriously hardcore child pornography .
during the investigation the german credit card companies agreed to provide us with names of the people who met five specific criteria : an exact amount that was charged , a specific use named for the charge , which bank the payment was made to , a specific identification number , and a very limited time frame .
so we could be fairly certain that only the people who were named to us had paid to enter into this special membership area .
in the end , we got around 322 suspects ' names , and could investigate them further .
and in fact , almost all of the people were correctly identified as users of child pornography .
what became of those suspects ?
they were investigated by state authorities , who confiscated pcs , laptops , and hard drives .
these were analyzed , or still are being analyzed .
the information went to state prosecutors , who decide whether to prosecute , or perhaps to levy a fine .
what exactly made this process so different from other investigations into child pornography ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit card companies gave police a list of potential customers of child porn the decisive difference here is that german credit card companies agreed to help us .
a few years earlier they had agreed to a code of conduct that said , essentially , " our credit cards should not be used to for criminal activity , especially not for crimes like child pornography .
and we will do all we can to fight this . "
so we took them at their word .
moreover , i have to make clear it was the credit card companies that examined the data , not the police .
we were only given the information of the 322 who met those five very limited criteria .
do you know why this method has n't been used before ?
i don ’ t know .
for us , we suddenly had this case , and we said , ok , let 's do it this way .
but why no one else had done it , i ca n't say .
could a case like this actually be the first-and-last of its kind ?
would n't knowledge of this method just make vendors and users of child pornography more careful about hiding their paper trail ?
from the point of view of law enforcement agencies , you don ’ t have to worry about that .
there are a lot of ways to investigate these criminals , even if they find other ways to conspire .
is there any one development in child pornography that is seen as particularly dangerous right now ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's internet watch foundation said child porn images have increased 1,500 percent since 1997 the key is to know that child pornography is the representation , the embodiment , of the sexual abuse of children .
for something to be considered child pornography , it involves the sexual portrayal of a child - that is , according to german law , a person under age 14 .
the biggest danger is that there is a market , in germany and worldwide , for materials that portray this .
and that there are sometimes even organized groups who exploit these markets and make child pornography to sell to them .
where does the material filling the market come from ?
sometimes it was made in very poor countries , like for example in latin america , southeast asia or eastern europe .
countries where children 's rights may not be as highly valued as here in germany .
the families are very poor , they have eight to 10 kids .
they do n't know how they can manage from one day to the next .
and the child is then sold to sex criminals who film their acts and sometimes go on to sell these images .
are there certain areas within europe where the problems are greatest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international cooperation is crucial in identifying perpetrators and sexual exploitation victims no , there is no part of europe that is particularly more active than another .
everyone is equally affected by this .
do european countries and agencies work well together on this issue ? how can international cooperation be improved ?
in recent years , a number of different measures against child pornography were undertaken , and various alliances and groups were formed .
for example at interpol in lyon or europol in the hague .
also there is a tight connection between central german organizations , like the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- , and their counterparts in london or paris .
and then , there are regular international conferences to discuss experiences and share information .
of course , it could all be improved upon .
but politicians are working on it , trying to harmonize certain things .
like the laws in various countries .
every country does n't apply the same laws to child sex offenses .
so in europe - and worldwide - they still have to make some changes .
where is the need for change the greatest ?
at this point , the problem is recognized around the world .
a decade ago , there were some countries where you could n't really talk openly about the topic at all .
but now this has changed .
people recognize something must be done .
and i see that people are working very hard to protect children .
that 's what the goal of this work really is : to scare off potential child pornographers and protect children .
can individuals do anything to protect their children from becoming victims of internet related sex abuse ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in chat rooms can become prey for sex predators it is very important that parents and teachers learn how to use the media .
many teachers and parents just throw up their hands and say , " i do n't know how to use this ; you do it . "
they leave it up to the child to use the media .
so the children wind up in chat rooms where they think they are chatting with people of their own age .
but there are actually a lot of men there who are much older .
they claim to be young .
they make dates to meet , exchange phone numbers .
and then the date turns out to be a sexual assault .
teachers and parents really need to be aware of this .
there are too many people who still do n't know about it .
they should keep an eye on who their children know , who they are meeting , where and when . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has been criticised because the bank of england , unlike the federal reserve and european central bank , initially refused to inject large amounts of cash into the money markets to help banks that were suffering liquidity problems . "
for the sake of his reputation and that of the bank , king has a lot of explaining to do . "
robert peston , bbc business editor then , in a sudden about-turn following the problems at northern rock , the bank decided it would put an extra £ 10bn into the market and would accept a wider range of collateral from the banks .
mr king also reportedly clashed with the financial services agency about their desire for early intervention to help northern rock .
mr king had previously warned the banks they were accumulating too many bad risks , and that it would not be the business of the bank of england to bail them out .
academic background mervyn king was appointed to the top job at the central bank following the retirement of sir edward george in june 2003 .
before that he had been deputy governor and chief economist .
he was born in 1948 and studied at king 's college , cambridge and harvard university .
he taught economics at harvard , mit , cambridge and birmingham universities , before becoming professor of economics at the london school of economics in 1984 .
one person he taught at cambridge was bob parker who is now deputy chairman of credit suisse asset management .
" if you 'd asked me the question over 30 years ago ' did i think that he would eventually end up as governor of the bank of england ' i think the answer was no , " he says .
" he was very likeable , very personable , very friendly , very approachable ; taught economics in a very clear , easy to understand way , " he adds .
bank expert he left academia to join the bank of england in 1991 and so was there when the bank was given independence to set uk interest rates in 1997 .
mr king was put in charge of the new quarterly inflation reports , which he worked on with danny gabay , who is now director of fathom financial consulting .
" he adopts a very intellectual approach , and always did , to the bank of england 's work , which i think has borne fruit , " he says .
" he is a serious person , particularly when it comes to policy , but he has a lighter side as his frequent references to sport in his speeches -lrb- show -rrb- , " he adds .
mr king has been a member of the bank 's interest rate-setting monetary policy committee -lrb- mpc -rrb- since it first met in june 1997. and is the only member who has attended all 125 meetings so far .
inflation hawk he was originally thought of as something of an inflation hawk and in june and july 2002 he was the only member of the mpc to vote in favour of a rise in rates .
but professor stephen nickell , who used to be a member of the mpc , says that he never tried to dominate proceedings .
" he was very punctilious about allowing everyone to have their say and never attempting to dominate or force his own views on others , " he says .
" i think this is one of the reasons why the mpc continues to be a success , " he adds .

he has been criticised because the bank of england , unlike the federal reserve and european central bank , initially refused to inject large amounts of cash into the money markets to help banks that were suffering liquidity problems .
for the sake of his reputation and that of the bank , king has a lot of explaining to do .
robert peston , bbc business editor mervyn - still on the rocks then , in a sudden about-turn following the problems at northern rock , the bank decided it would put an extra £ 10bn into the market and would accept a wider range of collateral from the banks .
mr king also reportedly clashed with the financial services agency about their desire for early intervention to help northern rock .
mr king had previously warned the banks they were accumulating too many bad risks , and that it would not be the business of the bank of england to bail them out .
academic background mervyn king was appointed to the top job at the central bank following the retirement of sir edward george in june 2003 .
the chancellor and governor are both trying to steady the markets before that he had been deputy governor and chief economist .
he was born in 1948 and studied at king 's college , cambridge and harvard university .
he taught economics at harvard , mit , cambridge and birmingham universities , before becoming professor of economics at the london school of economics in 1984 .
one person he taught at cambridge was bob parker who is now deputy chairman of credit suisse asset management .
" if you 'd asked me the question over 30 years ago ' did i think that he would eventually end up as governor of the bank of england ' i think the answer was no , " he says .
" he was very likeable , very personable , very friendly , very approachable ; taught economics in a very clear , easy to understand way , " he adds .
bank expert he left academia to join the bank of england in 1991 and so was there when the bank was given independence to set uk interest rates in 1997 .
mr king was put in charge of the new quarterly inflation reports , which he worked on with danny gabay , who is now director of fathom financial consulting .
" he adopts a very intellectual approach , and always did , to the bank of england 's work , which i think has borne fruit , " he says .
" he is a serious person , particularly when it comes to policy , but he has a lighter side as his frequent references to sport in his speeches -lrb- show -rrb- , " he adds .
mr king has been a member of the bank 's interest rate-setting monetary policy committee -lrb- mpc -rrb- since it first met in june 1997. and is the only member who has attended all 125 meetings so far .
inflation hawk he was originally thought of as something of an inflation hawk and in june and july 2002 he was the only member of the mpc to vote in favour of a rise in rates .
but professor stephen nickell , who used to be a member of the mpc , says that he never tried to dominate proceedings .
" he was very punctilious about allowing everyone to have their say and never attempting to dominate or force his own views on others , " he says .
" i think this is one of the reasons why the mpc continues to be a success , " he adds .

development agencies and immigration bodies have reacted to her concerns about crime linked to foreigners .
rhian beynon , joint council for the welfare of immigrants " more reliable data on the size of the migrant population needs to be developed for a really sound discussion of public service resources to take place .
as cambridgeshire police point out , migrants make an important economic contribution and the majority will also be paying taxes for their services like everyone else . "
shailesh vara , conservative mp for north west cambridgeshire " it is important to recognise that this is not an issue to do with race or racism .
this is about recognition of the fact that a large number of people are coming into the country and we need resources to deal with those people . "
brendan barber , tuc general secretary " what would be very unfortunate was if , on the back of that very legitimate concern , there was an attempt to create an impression that migrant workers are a major problem and that the response to that should be a negative response and that we should n't be welcoming .
we have to support them , we have to more effectively ensure that they are not able to be exploited by rogue employers and we have to help with things like english language skills . "
john wilkinson , east of england development agency " what businesses in this region are saying to us is that -lsb- migrants are -rsb- absolutely critical to a growing and successful economy .
and of course we need to manage the impact that those migrants are having on this region .
inevitably if we want to grow this region 's economy ... then we need more migrants with skills to come and fill the jobs that are available and there are obviously costs associated with that .
and it 's for the government to decide how they divide up the revenue ... to best manage the impact that the migrants have .
one of the areas that we 're focusing on is the appropriate provision of information and advice to migrant workers and also to employers of migrant workers . "
sir andrew green , migration watch uk " what is underlying this , i think , is the basic problem - the sheer scale of immigration .
i mean , foreign immigration - even allowing for those who leave - is now running at about 800 a day .
we 're having to build 200 houses every day for the next 20 years , just for new immigrants .
well , that 's illustrative , if you like , of the costs on our society and on our environment .
and that 's why we have said that we must get the numbers down - get all of this manageable . "
nigel farage , uk independence party leader " mrs spence is at the sharp end of policing and we must listen to her calls for help .
eu laws forbid us from denying entry to known criminals - even murderers and rapists - so it 's no wonder that the police forces are feeling the strain .
this is a situation which could be repeated in any part of the country ; if it has not been already .
we need to be tougher on people coming to this country who break our laws and not be the soft touch of europe .
i hope labour , tories and lib dems are feeling guilty about the problems they have inflicted on hard working britons following their stupid decision to vote for eu enlargement and allow these waves of migrants which have caused problems in all sectors of the community . "
peter conniff , bedforshire police authority chairman " some -lsb- migrants -rsb- come from countries where there 's a culture of carrying knives , with a culture of drink-driving , there 's also a very major language problem as well .
at the moment now we 've got in excess of 80 languages being spoken throughout the county .
now this does mean that interpreting costs are huge .
in bedfordshire they 've now rocketed to half a million pounds a year . "

development agencies and immigration bodies have reacted to her concerns about crime linked to foreigners .
rhian beynon , joint council for the welfare of immigrants more reliable data on the size of the migrant population needs to be developed for a really sound discussion of public service resources to take place .
as cambridgeshire police point out , migrants make an important economic contribution and the majority will also be paying taxes for their services like everyone else .
shailesh vara , conservative mp for north west cambridgeshire it is important to recognise that this is not an issue to do with race or racism .
this is about recognition of the fact that a large number of people are coming into the country and we need resources to deal with those people .
brendan barber , tuc general secretary what would be very unfortunate was if , on the back of that very legitimate concern , there was an attempt to create an impression that migrant workers are a major problem and that the response to that should be a negative response and that we should n't be welcoming .
we have to support them , we have to more effectively ensure that they are not able to be exploited by rogue employers and we have to help with things like english language skills .
john wilkinson , east of england development agency what businesses in this region are saying to us is that -lsb- migrants are -rsb- absolutely critical to a growing and successful economy .
and of course we need to manage the impact that those migrants are having on this region .
inevitably if we want to grow this region 's economy ... then we need more migrants with skills to come and fill the jobs that are available and there are obviously costs associated with that .
and it 's for the government to decide how they divide up the revenue ... to best manage the impact that the migrants have .
one of the areas that we 're focusing on is the appropriate provision of information and advice to migrant workers and also to employers of migrant workers .
sir andrew green , migration watch uk what is underlying this , i think , is the basic problem - the sheer scale of immigration .
i mean , foreign immigration - even allowing for those who leave - is now running at about 800 a day .
we 're having to build 200 houses every day for the next 20 years , just for new immigrants .
well , that 's illustrative , if you like , of the costs on our society and on our environment .
and that 's why we have said that we must get the numbers down - get all of this manageable .
nigel farage , uk independence party leader mrs spence is at the sharp end of policing and we must listen to her calls for help .
eu laws forbid us from denying entry to known criminals - even murderers and rapists - so it 's no wonder that the police forces are feeling the strain .
this is a situation which could be repeated in any part of the country ; if it has not been already .
we need to be tougher on people coming to this country who break our laws and not be the soft touch of europe .
i hope labour , tories and lib dems are feeling guilty about the problems they have inflicted on hard working britons following their stupid decision to vote for eu enlargement and allow these waves of migrants which have caused problems in all sectors of the community .
peter conniff , bedforshire police authority chairman some -lsb- migrants -rsb- come from countries where there 's a culture of carrying knives , with a culture of drink-driving , there 's also a very major language problem as well .
at the moment now we 've got in excess of 80 languages being spoken throughout the county .
now this does mean that interpreting costs are huge .
in bedfordshire they 've now rocketed to half a million pounds a year .

it has been a dramatic week on the financial markets , with the us central bank cutting interest rates and the uk government coming to the rescue of savers at the northern rock .
so is the crisis over , or are there still some big problems remaining ?
where 's the bad debt ?
the crisis began when us mortgage companies made hundreds of billions of dollars of inappropriate loans to individuals with poor credit histories .
these debts were then packaged up and sold to financial institutions around the world , who then sold it on to pension funds and hedge funds .
we still do n't know where these bad debts are concealed in the financial system .
and until we do , banks will still be reluctant to lend to each other , and investors will be suspicious of the health of the financial sector .
unfreezing the credit crunch the reluctance by banks and other financial institutions to lend money , because they are not sure how risky it might be , is gumming up the financial system .
despite the injection of hundreds of billions of dollars and euros , interest rates on inter-bank lending are still unusually high .
and banks are tightening up on their lending to individuals and companies , restricting the amount of lending as well as making loans more expensive .
there are also hundreds of billions of dollars worth of short-term debt obligations that will fall due in the next six months , which could further depress the market if no buyers can be found for them .
will the housing market crash ?
the overhang of bad mortgages is depressing the us housing market .
thousands of people are having their homes repossessed , and with a glut of homes on the market prices are dropping .
mortgage companies are finding it difficult to raise money even to lend to sound borrowers .
so despite a pledge by the us government to help , house building is at a record low .
although there are far fewer sub-prime mortgages in the uk , mortgage lenders like northern rock are also finding it difficult to raise the cash to pay for additional mortgage lending .
so it could become harder to get a mortgage , and it could cost more - and both these expectations are lowering house price inflation .
will there be a world recession ?
a big slowdown in the housing market could have serious economic consequences .
construction is a big part of the economy , and people who move house are also more likely to buy consumer goods like washing machines .
the tightening up of credit and worries about mortgage repayments may make everyone more nervous about borrowing money to buy big-ticket items like cars .
there are already signs of an economic slowdown in the us , the world 's biggest economy .
and if it deepens , it could dampen down the economic recovery underway in europe and japan .
the uk , as a major exporting nation , would also be affected .
will the dollar plummet ?
the effect on the rest of the world economy could be worse if the us dollar begins to fall in value .
the dollar is already weak because of the huge trade deficit the us runs with the rest of the world - nearly $ 1 trillion - which has been a big boost to the world economy .
but if the us economy slows , and interest rates are cut sharply , the dollar will become a less attractive currency and could fall further .
this in turn would make imports into the us more expensive , and make it harder for exporters like britain to win orders .
a big decline could also force countries like china , which hold $ 1.3 trillion in currency reserves , mainly in dollars , to diversify their holdings , further depressing the greenback .
who 's to blame ?
politicians and financial institutions are trading accusations about who is to blame for the crisis .
in the uk , the governor of the bank of england is under fire for not intervening earlier to prevent the northern rock crisis from getting out of hand .
in the us , the central bank , the federal reserve , is under fire in congress for not regulating sub-prime mortgage lending properly .
and both bankers and politicians have blamed the credit rating agencies for certifying as safe many of the bad debts which had been bundled up and sold .
there is a growing move to tighten up international regulation of the financial sector - but worries about whether this can be done without inhibiting financial innovation .
is there a silver lining ?
many economists believe that the crisis is also an opportunity for rebalancing the economy , which has become overly dependent on consumer spending financed by cheap credit and government borrowing .
an increase in household savings , encouraged by higher interest rates for savers , could lead to more long-term investment .
and a mild economic slowdown in the us , coupled with a gradual reduction in the value of the dollar , could help rebalance the world economy , which has become overly dependent on the us as the engine of world economic growth .

it has been a dramatic week on the financial markets , with the us central bank cutting interest rates and the uk government coming to the rescue of savers at the northern rock .
so is the crisis over , or are there still some big problems remaining ?
where 's the bad debt ?
the crisis began when us mortgage companies made hundreds of billions of dollars of inappropriate loans to individuals with poor credit histories .
these debts were then packaged up and sold to financial institutions around the world , who then sold it on to pension funds and hedge funds .
we still do n't know where these bad debts are concealed in the financial system .
and until we do , banks will still be reluctant to lend to each other , and investors will be suspicious of the health of the financial sector .
unfreezing the credit crunch the reluctance by banks and other financial institutions to lend money , because they are not sure how risky it might be , is gumming up the financial system .
despite the injection of hundreds of billions of dollars and euros , interest rates on inter-bank lending are still unusually high .
and banks are tightening up on their lending to individuals and companies , restricting the amount of lending as well as making loans more expensive .
there are also hundreds of billions of dollars worth of short-term debt obligations that will fall due in the next six months , which could further depress the market if no buyers can be found for them .
will the housing market crash ?
the overhang of bad mortgages is depressing the us housing market .
thousands of people are having their homes repossessed , and with a glut of homes on the market prices are dropping .
mortgage companies are finding it difficult to raise money even to lend to sound borrowers .
so despite a pledge by the us government to help , house building is at a record low .
although there are far fewer sub-prime mortgages in the uk , mortgage lenders like northern rock are also finding it difficult to raise the cash to pay for additional mortgage lending .
so it could become harder to get a mortgage , and it could cost more - and both these expectations are lowering house price inflation .
will there be a world recession ?
a big slowdown in the housing market could have serious economic consequences .
construction is a big part of the economy , and people who move house are also more likely to buy consumer goods like washing machines .
the tightening up of credit and worries about mortgage repayments may make everyone more nervous about borrowing money to buy big-ticket items like cars .
there are already signs of an economic slowdown in the us , the world 's biggest economy .
and if it deepens , it could dampen down the economic recovery underway in europe and japan .
the uk , as a major exporting nation , would also be affected .

mortgage companies are finding it difficult to raise money even to lend to sound borrowers .
so despite a pledge by the us government to help , house building is at a record low .
although there are far fewer sub-prime mortgages in the uk , mortgage lenders like northern rock are also finding it difficult to raise the cash to pay for additional mortgage lending .
so it could become harder to get a mortgage , and it could cost more - and both these expectations are lowering house price inflation .
will there be a world recession ?
a big slowdown in the housing market could have serious economic consequences .
construction is a big part of the economy , and people who move house are also more likely to buy consumer goods like washing machines .
the tightening up of credit and worries about mortgage repayments may make everyone more nervous about borrowing money to buy big-ticket items like cars .
there are already signs of an economic slowdown in the us , the world 's biggest economy .
and if it deepens , it could dampen down the economic recovery underway in europe and japan .
the uk , as a major exporting nation , would also be affected .
will the dollar plummet ?
the effect on the rest of the world economy could be worse if the us dollar begins to fall in value .
the dollar is already weak because of the huge trade deficit the us runs with the rest of the world - nearly $ 1 trillion - which has been a big boost to the world economy .
but if the us economy slows , and interest rates are cut sharply , the dollar will become a less attractive currency and could fall further .
this in turn would make imports into the us more expensive , and make it harder for exporters like britain to win orders .
a big decline could also force countries like china , which hold $ 1.3 trillion in currency reserves , mainly in dollars , to diversify their holdings , further depressing the greenback .
who 's to blame ?
politicians and financial institutions are trading accusations about who is to blame for the crisis .
in the uk , the governor of the bank of england is under fire for not intervening earlier to prevent the northern rock crisis from getting out of hand .
in the us , the central bank , the federal reserve , is under fire in congress for not regulating sub-prime mortgage lending properly .
and both bankers and politicians have blamed the credit rating agencies for certifying as safe many of the bad debts which had been bundled up and sold .
there is a growing move to tighten up international regulation of the financial sector - but worries about whether this can be done without inhibiting financial innovation .
is there a silver lining ?
many economists believe that the crisis is also an opportunity for rebalancing the economy , which has become overly dependent on consumer spending financed by cheap credit and government borrowing .
an increase in household savings , encouraged by higher interest rates for savers , could lead to more long-term investment .
and a mild economic slowdown in the us , coupled with a gradual reduction in the value of the dollar , could help rebalance the world economy , which has become overly dependent on the us as the engine of world economic growth .

he is closely followed by party leader sir menzies campbell and environment spokesman chris huhne - both on 32 .
but our man at the stall reports a bizarre demand by some delegates .
" seven or eight people have come in asking for badges of -lsb- former labour home secretary -rsb- john reid , " he said .
delegates walking past the brighton centre were surprised to be handed the gift of a sapling silver birch tree in a bag .
when asked how big they grow , the man distributing them on behalf of the freight transport association replied : " as big as your heart . "
but the brighton centre security guards were more circumspect , warning not to plant the saplings - which grow to about 30 metres in height - too near a house .
fringe round-up laws ' bullied at school ' : lib dem education spokesman david laws revealed he had been bullied at primary school .
he told a fringe meeting organised by the nspcc : " i was about age five or so .
there was a guy in the year above who was a bit of a big guy and he started picking on me . "
the bully threatened to " duff up " the future mp for yeovil , but the intimidation " did n't last very long " .
mr laws , who lists rugby among his hobbies , said he had fought back , adding : " my final memory , from when i was a year older , was that he tried to bully a friend of mine and i just went up to the bully and i thumped him hard . "
justin parkinson families ' need better understanding ' : a lack of understanding between parents and children could contribute to the radicalisation of young muslims , lib dem home affairs spokesman nick clegg argued .
he and mohammed abdul-bari of the muslim council of britain talked about ways of reaching out to communities in britain .
mr clegg said he did not see the same cohesion between generations that he saw when he visited his wife 's family in spain .
dr bari argued that modern life was leading to individualism , which was contributing to problems .
he said parents who had to go out to work were not able to nurture their children in the same way .
joanna shinn party ' too old and white ' : a panel of young people has told the liberal democrats they are too old , too white - and that they need to do more to capture voters ' imagination .
at a fringe meeting , six youths gave their first impressions of the party conference .
one said the amount of grey hair in the audience was " a surprise " , adding he was " stunned " by what he saw as pre-prepared questions and answers .
joanna shinn photo of the day quotes of the day " if there was a vacancy in the future then i probably would , " home affairs spokesman nick clegg on the party leadership .
" i am not appalled by photographs of this kind .
what is appalling about two young people who are obviously very affectionate towards each other ? , " sir menzies campbell on " cheeky boy " lembit opik 's hello ! spread .

the unlimited support for savers ' deposits covers accounts that were in existence up to midnight on wednesday 19 september .
it also covers accounts reopened in the future after being shut in the panic between 13 september and 19 september but new accounts opened after 19 september will not be protected .
" this guarantee covers future interest payments , movements of funds between existing accounts , and new deposits into existing accounts , " said a treasury statement released to the stock market at 0700bst .
" since it would otherwise be unfair to other banks and building societies , the arrangements would not cover any new accounts set up after 19 september , " it added .
added interest the guarantee will stay in place until the treasury judges that the crisis in the financial markets has abated .
the northern rock welcomed the treasury 's announcement .
" this further clarifies and improves the situation for northern rock savers , " a spokesman said .
the northern rock has already pledged that any savers who withdrew money in the panic could put it back , without any form of penalty charge or transfer fee , by 5 october .
any interest lost by those savers will also be credited to their re-opened accounts .
run on bank the offer of unlimited support to northern rock savers was made late on monday afternoon by the chancellor alistair darling .
however enquiries by the bbc revealed later that the authorities did not appear to have any plan in place to put this guarantee in action , should it be needed .
in the event , the northern rock savers are now unlikely to need to rely on the chancellor 's pledge as the run on the bank has ended .
the northern rock has , so far , not even needed to draw on the first emergency overdraft at the bank of england announced last week .
the treasury makes clear that its guarantee also covers unsecured borrowing and lending involving other banks .
but it does not does not cover bonds and securitised mortgages sold by the northern rock to other financial institutions .

the bank is the very latest casualty of the global credit crunch .
northern rock insists that it is safe , a view also held by the chancellor , the financial services authority and the british bankers ' association .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
this is something akin to mass hysteria ; if northern rock goes under it will be the fault of both its customers and the media and not the volatile market .
the atmosphere of blind panic generated by droves of savers flocking to join ever growing queues is self-perpetuating .
such behaviour is fickle , selfish and incredibly short sighted .
joe , liverpool if the housing market slows and house prices start to fall then the security of the loans provided by northern rock -lrb- and other banks -rrb- is lost .
then see how much more money is withdrawn : it would be a bun fight .
this point seems to have been missed , but is why it ? s all gone badly wrong in the us .
the run up to the sub prime issue in the us was very much like it has been over here , strong economy recovering from a low , higher than average house price inflation , loans to anyone even if they ca n't pay it back , falling unemployment .
ian , ipswich " i have been motivated to open new savings accounts so as to spread our savings and therefore acquire protection " brian roberts , sandbach the northern rock saga made me aware of the limited guarantee on bank savings .
before the previous weekend i had wrongly assumed all of my savings were protected if a major uk bank were to become insolvent .
given the relatively low limits , i have been motivated to open new savings accounts so as to spread our savings and therefore acquire protection , up to the standard limits , on each account .
one of the accounts i opened today was with northern rock where i have deposited £ 2,000 .
no matter what happens to the bank this amount will be guaranteed ? even if the recent government undertaking is withdrawn .
it has just occurred to me that if a significant proportion of investors followed suit they would both spread their personal risk and help the bank to recover .
brian roberts , sandbach if the money markets wo n't lend money to northern rock , why on earth should depositors lend them their money ?
steve frost , billingham i have been trying to access my online account since friday 14th september , not to withdraw all my money but simply to get sufficient funds out to pay for a new kitchen i am having fitted .
i ca n't get through and am so exasperated that when , -lrb- or if -rrb- , i eventually do succeed i will almost certainly withdraw all my funds and never trust an online account again !
anonymous " the people most worried about northern rock collapsing are -lrb- understandably -rrb- contributing to that collapse becoming a reality " chris grey , guildford the irony is that the people most worried about northern rock collapsing are -lrb- understandably -rrb- contributing to that collapse becoming a reality .
a good defensive strategy is never to put all one 's savings with one provider .
also no more than £ 35,000 of savings should be placed with any one organisation so as to make best use of the financial compensation scheme .
this strategy can be thwarted by mergers and takeovers .
for example , anyone whose savings were split between the nationwide and the portman should rethink calmly in the wake of the recent takeover .
chris grey , guildford i 'm a northern rock online customer and have been unable to access my account since last thursday .
the lack of service alone is reason enough to close my account .
paul , london i agree that customers have only been given re-assurances rather than a solid guarantee by either northern rock , the fsa , bank of england or the government .
i was not alarmed by the first announcement on thursday , but i am now !
i still can not access my money which is my only source of immediate funds .
sharon field , morpeth , northumberland " where is a safe haven for my cash now ? "
rob , sheffield after 36 hours of trying i finally got into my online account at northern rock .
if they do n't go bust before the bacs transfer , my £ 30k is as safe as hsbc for now ...
amongst the " reassurances " that our money was safe i heard no guarantees only opinions .
if -lrb- sorry , when -rrb- northern rock goes legs up i feel quite confident that its savers be the losers .
where is a safe haven for my cash now ?
which institution will be next on the list ?
i do n't have all my eggs in one basket but that does n't mean i would accept the loss of one basket of £ 30k with equanimity .
i want to be at the head of the queue next time , not battling for 36 hours .
rob , sheffield there may be a lot of people in debt in the country , but those who do have savings are likely to be quite prudent , probably risk-averse people .
i am not at all surprised that , in the circumstances , they are taking the precaution of getting their money back .
for anyone with good life savings - perhaps from the maturing of a pension or endowments - a compensation scheme which only partially covers the first £ 30-odd thousand is wholly inadequate .
what is more , people rightly think that , should they lose money in excess of this , there will be a deafening silence from the financial authorities and the government .
just look at the paltry amounts they have offered to people who lost pensions when companies closed - and only then after massive arm-twisting .
alison keys , brigg , north lincolnshire " when things go wrong , we , the customers , pay the price , not the boards of directors " cath , ipswich if i had cash with northern rock i would be right there in that queue .

will northern rock even open the post to address all these queries , or can i demand my money at the counter like everyone else ?

the bank is the very latest casualty of the global credit crunch .
northern rock insists that it is safe , a view also held by the chancellor , the financial services authority and the british bankers ' association .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
this is something akin to mass hysteria ; if northern rock goes under it will be the fault of both its customers and the media and not the volatile market .
the atmosphere of blind panic generated by droves of savers flocking to join ever growing queues is self-perpetuating .
such behaviour is fickle , selfish and incredibly short sighted .
joe , liverpool if the housing market slows and house prices start to fall then the security of the loans provided by northern rock -lrb- and other banks -rrb- is lost .
then see how much more money is withdrawn : it would be a bun fight .
this point seems to have been missed , but is why it ? s all gone badly wrong in the us .
the run up to the sub prime issue in the us was very much like it has been over here , strong economy recovering from a low , higher than average house price inflation , loans to anyone even if they ca n't pay it back , falling unemployment .
ian , ipswich i have been motivated to open new savings accounts so as to spread our savings and therefore acquire protection brian roberts , sandbach the northern rock saga made me aware of the limited guarantee on bank savings .
before the previous weekend i had wrongly assumed all of my savings were protected if a major uk bank were to become insolvent .
given the relatively low limits , i have been motivated to open new savings accounts so as to spread our savings and therefore acquire protection , up to the standard limits , on each account .
one of the accounts i opened today was with northern rock where i have deposited £ 2,000 .
no matter what happens to the bank this amount will be guaranteed ? even if the recent government undertaking is withdrawn .
it has just occurred to me that if a significant proportion of investors followed suit they would both spread their personal risk and help the bank to recover .
brian roberts , sandbach if the money markets wo n't lend money to northern rock , why on earth should depositors lend them their money ?
steve frost , billingham i have been trying to access my online account since friday 14th september , not to withdraw all my money but simply to get sufficient funds out to pay for a new kitchen i am having fitted .
i ca n't get through and am so exasperated that when , -lrb- or if -rrb- , i eventually do succeed i will almost certainly withdraw all my funds and never trust an online account again !
anonymous the people most worried about northern rock collapsing are -lrb- understandably -rrb- contributing to that collapse becoming a reality chris grey , guildford the irony is that the people most worried about northern rock collapsing are -lrb- understandably -rrb- contributing to that collapse becoming a reality .
a good defensive strategy is never to put all one 's savings with one provider .
also no more than £ 35,000 of savings should be placed with any one organisation so as to make best use of the financial compensation scheme .
this strategy can be thwarted by mergers and takeovers .
for example , anyone whose savings were split between the nationwide and the portman should rethink calmly in the wake of the recent takeover .
chris grey , guildford i 'm a northern rock online customer and have been unable to access my account since last thursday .
the lack of service alone is reason enough to close my account .
paul , london i agree that customers have only been given re-assurances rather than a solid guarantee by either northern rock , the fsa , bank of england or the government .
i was not alarmed by the first announcement on thursday , but i am now !
i still can not access my money which is my only source of immediate funds .
sharon field , morpeth , northumberland where is a safe haven for my cash now ?
rob , sheffield after 36 hours of trying i finally got into my online account at northern rock .
if they do n't go bust before the bacs transfer , my £ 30k is as safe as hsbc for now ...
amongst the " reassurances " that our money was safe i heard no guarantees only opinions .
if -lrb- sorry , when -rrb- northern rock goes legs up i feel quite confident that its savers be the losers .
where is a safe haven for my cash now ?
which institution will be next on the list ?
i do n't have all my eggs in one basket but that does n't mean i would accept the loss of one basket of £ 30k with equanimity .
i want to be at the head of the queue next time , not battling for 36 hours .
rob , sheffield there may be a lot of people in debt in the country , but those who do have savings are likely to be quite prudent , probably risk-averse people .
i am not at all surprised that , in the circumstances , they are taking the precaution of getting their money back .
for anyone with good life savings - perhaps from the maturing of a pension or endowments - a compensation scheme which only partially covers the first £ 30-odd thousand is wholly inadequate .
what is more , people rightly think that , should they lose money in excess of this , there will be a deafening silence from the financial authorities and the government .
just look at the paltry amounts they have offered to people who lost pensions when companies closed - and only then after massive arm-twisting .

trevor ingman , fittleworth , west sussex in view of northern rock 's current woes , it seems extraordinary that they have no information about the crisis on their website , other than the stock exchange statement issued yesterday .
what an appalling example of customer relations .
ignoring the problem on their website is not a solution .
terry cartwright , farnham , surrey as a northern rock customer , i am most annoyed that there is no way to access my savings .
they are in an online account and northern rock says the account can only be accessed via the web , not phone or branch visit .
the website has not functioned since at least thursday evening .
if the bank wishes to avoid panic , it should provide some means to access funds .
bob grindrod , huntingdon there are reports today that northern rock customers have withdrawn some £ 1bn .
however , presumably these are customers with access to northern rock branches .
for those , such as ourselves , who have an internet account , it has been impossible over the last couple of days to log-on , either because the site says that it is " experiencing technical problems " or , more recently , because the site is very busy - " please try again " .
one " tries again " repeatedly with the same lack of success .
is northern rock deliberately frustrating the wishes of internet customers to carry out transactions ?
hein velissarides , woking i was n't going to panic until i saw the run on northern rock jackie palfreman , balintore , highlands what about internet customers who can not storm and panic and withdraw their money ?
it should have been foreseen that people would panic and a block should have put on withdrawing their money - at least until calm and common sense could prevail .
media hype , once more , causes panic .
we can not all bombard the bank , we have to sit and wait until the internet is up and running again .
i was n't going to panic until i saw the run on northern rock .
jackie palfreman , balintore , highlands those panicking customers who are queuing to withdraw their money are n't doing anybody -lrb- including themselves -rrb- any favours .
there is no immediate danger of northern rock going bankrupt and nobody is going to lose their savings .
however , as a customer of northern rock since it was a mutual -lrb- and i wish it still was -rrb- i own shares which are plummeting in value as a result of this behaviour .
given time , the business will bounce back and so will the share value .
we 've seen it before with m & s , sainsbury 's - all sound businesses whose shares fell in value temporarily because their profits were n't quite as good as they used to be .
unfortunately , northern rock is likely to get bought out by another bank while the shares are cheap and those of us who used to own the business as customers , will be paid a fraction of the real value .
once again the big banks win and the small customers lose .
ian nicholson , glasgow the fundamental question is why the financial bodies -lrb- government , bank of england , northern rock etc . -rrb- have not been able to explain to intelligent but non-expert people why the current situation is " ok " .
we get the serious talking head saying " we have confidence " but then we do n't get an explanation of why .
i want to know and i 'm prepared to learn quickly .
please tell us !
robert peston 's blog seemed a good start but even that left me wanting more .
jeremy wheeler , reading in the northern rock crisis , the chancellor , the fsa and the bank of england are all telling savers not to panic and deal as normal , but thousands of online savers can not access their money because the online section of the northern rock website does not work .
whether this is due to overload or technical problems is not clear but the perception could be that it has been switched off .
what a simple way to stop outflow .
online savers have been given no explanation or been offered any alternative means of accessing their savings .
is it any wonder no one believes anything they are told from on high these days ?
alan morris , glasgow if i withdraw my savings will i get my money or simply compound the problem ?
angela , kidderminster my life 's savings are in northern rock .
i only hold a postal account .
although very concerned , i understood the need for people not to panic and to allow the systems put in place by the bank of england to flow into action .
however , like me , people are concerned that they will lose their savings , hence the huge queues !
what should i do ?
if i withdraw my savings will i get my money or simply compound the problem ?
will northern rock even open the post to address all these queries , or can i demand my money at the counter like everyone else ?
very concerned pensioner , angela , kidderminster surely northern rock should have been put into some form of administration as part of the bank of england bail-out , heading off the stampede that is threatening to ruin non-panickers such as myself .
while i would like to agree with the comment of paul lewis on tv this morning that the bank of england can not afford to let rock go bust , what does that really mean for savers - and how long are the guarantees and assurances of the chancellor , the fsa , angela knight et al good for ?
colin mcalpin , tonbridge the current crisis at northern rock suggests that it is time for the current financial compensation system to be raised from the existing 100 % of the first £ 2000 and 90 % of the next £ 33,000 to a more realistic level .
brian kelly , didcot if the government and bank of england are convinced that northern rock is a sound business , then why do n't they declare that all investors have 100 % security backed by the government ?
that would surely then stem the run on the bank .

the bank is the very latest casualty of the global credit crunch .
northern rock insists that it is safe , a view also held by the chancellor , the financial services authority and the british bankers ' association .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
this is something akin to mass hysteria ; if northern rock goes under it will be the fault of both its customers and the media and not the volatile market .
the atmosphere of blind panic generated by droves of savers flocking to join ever growing queues is self-perpetuating .
such behaviour is fickle , selfish and incredibly short sighted .
joe , liverpool if the housing market slows and house prices start to fall then the security of the loans provided by northern rock -lrb- and other banks -rrb- is lost .
then see how much more money is withdrawn : it would be a bun fight .
this point seems to have been missed , but is why it ? s all gone badly wrong in the us .
the run up to the sub prime issue in the us was very much like it has been over here , strong economy recovering from a low , higher than average house price inflation , loans to anyone even if they ca n't pay it back , falling unemployment .
ian , ipswich i have been motivated to open new savings accounts so as to spread our savings and therefore acquire protection brian roberts , sandbach the northern rock saga made me aware of the limited guarantee on bank savings .
before the previous weekend i had wrongly assumed all of my savings were protected if a major uk bank were to become insolvent .
given the relatively low limits , i have been motivated to open new savings accounts so as to spread our savings and therefore acquire protection , up to the standard limits , on each account .
one of the accounts i opened today was with northern rock where i have deposited £ 2,000 .
no matter what happens to the bank this amount will be guaranteed ? even if the recent government undertaking is withdrawn .
it has just occurred to me that if a significant proportion of investors followed suit they would both spread their personal risk and help the bank to recover .
brian roberts , sandbach if the money markets wo n't lend money to northern rock , why on earth should depositors lend them their money ?
steve frost , billingham i have been trying to access my online account since friday 14th september , not to withdraw all my money but simply to get sufficient funds out to pay for a new kitchen i am having fitted .
i ca n't get through and am so exasperated that when , -lrb- or if -rrb- , i eventually do succeed i will almost certainly withdraw all my funds and never trust an online account again !
anonymous the people most worried about northern rock collapsing are -lrb- understandably -rrb- contributing to that collapse becoming a reality chris grey , guildford the irony is that the people most worried about northern rock collapsing are -lrb- understandably -rrb- contributing to that collapse becoming a reality .
a good defensive strategy is never to put all one 's savings with one provider .
also no more than £ 35,000 of savings should be placed with any one organisation so as to make best use of the financial compensation scheme .
this strategy can be thwarted by mergers and takeovers .
for example , anyone whose savings were split between the nationwide and the portman should rethink calmly in the wake of the recent takeover .
chris grey , guildford i 'm a northern rock online customer and have been unable to access my account since last thursday .
the lack of service alone is reason enough to close my account .
paul , london i agree that customers have only been given re-assurances rather than a solid guarantee by either northern rock , the fsa , bank of england or the government .
i was not alarmed by the first announcement on thursday , but i am now !
i still can not access my money which is my only source of immediate funds .
sharon field , morpeth , northumberland where is a safe haven for my cash now ?
rob , sheffield after 36 hours of trying i finally got into my online account at northern rock .
if they do n't go bust before the bacs transfer , my £ 30k is as safe as hsbc for now ...
amongst the " reassurances " that our money was safe i heard no guarantees only opinions .
if -lrb- sorry , when -rrb- northern rock goes legs up i feel quite confident that its savers be the losers .
where is a safe haven for my cash now ?
which institution will be next on the list ?
i do n't have all my eggs in one basket but that does n't mean i would accept the loss of one basket of £ 30k with equanimity .
i want to be at the head of the queue next time , not battling for 36 hours .
rob , sheffield there may be a lot of people in debt in the country , but those who do have savings are likely to be quite prudent , probably risk-averse people .
i am not at all surprised that , in the circumstances , they are taking the precaution of getting their money back .
for anyone with good life savings - perhaps from the maturing of a pension or endowments - a compensation scheme which only partially covers the first £ 30-odd thousand is wholly inadequate .
what is more , people rightly think that , should they lose money in excess of this , there will be a deafening silence from the financial authorities and the government .
just look at the paltry amounts they have offered to people who lost pensions when companies closed - and only then after massive arm-twisting .
alison keys , brigg , north lincolnshire when things go wrong , we , the customers , pay the price , not the boards of directors cath , ipswich if i had cash with northern rock i would be right there in that queue .
i have no trust in any financial institution whatsoever .
i do n't think i am alone in that attitude .
ask those who , in past crises , have lost their pensions , homes or life-savings .
were they not given the same assurances ?
we are obliged to use " financial services " .
when things go wrong , we , the customers , pay the price , not the boards of directors .
cath , ipswich i tried all day with the website yesterday and even got up at 2am to try again .
like your listeners , i was convinced they were blocking access .
however at 9am today i got through and have closed my account .
i feel bad about it because i realise it could cause them even more problems .
sarah , manchester all your commentators are whistling in the wind .
there has been a long series of events -lrb- equitable life , pensions , endowment mortgages -rrb- in the course of which , the government and other organisations have shown that the customer or employee will be last in the line to be compensated if the business does collapse .
people know that others have lost everything in the past .
northern rock can not be held responsible for poor communication when the cause has been years of experience .
ms h. cook , birmingham the bbc made a big fuss about the bank of england loaning money to northern rock : if it was trivial why did the bbc lead so many of their news bulletins with that ?
mark , sidcup you spent half your programme complaining the northern rock website could n't cope with the surge in activity .
just how much must these banks spend on computers to cope with a once in eighty years surge in activity ?
you seem to be saying no one should worry , but the bbc made a big fuss about the bank of england loaning money to northern rock : if it was trivial why did the bbc lead so many of their news bulletins with that ?
mark , sidcup would there be any possibility that there is a move to push northern rock out of business - a competitor , or other commercial motive ?
what would the conspiracy theorists out there say ?
amanda clegg , godalming we kept being told that equitable life was solvent but people still lost a lot of money .

however , like me , people are concerned that they will lose their savings , hence the huge queues !
what should i do ?
if i withdraw my savings will i get my money or simply compound the problem ?
will northern rock even open the post to address all these queries , or can i demand my money at the counter like everyone else ?

the bank is the very latest casualty of the global credit crunch .
northern rock insists that it is safe , a view also held by the chancellor , the financial services authority and the british bankers ' association .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
this is something akin to mass hysteria ; if northern rock goes under it will be the fault of both its customers and the media and not the volatile market .
the atmosphere of blind panic generated by droves of savers flocking to join ever growing queues is self-perpetuating .
such behaviour is fickle , selfish and incredibly short sighted .
joe , liverpool if the housing market slows and house prices start to fall then the security of the loans provided by northern rock -lrb- and other banks -rrb- is lost .
then see how much more money is withdrawn : it would be a bun fight .
this point seems to have been missed , but is why it ? s all gone badly wrong in the us .
the run up to the sub prime issue in the us was very much like it has been over here , strong economy recovering from a low , higher than average house price inflation , loans to anyone even if they ca n't pay it back , falling unemployment .
ian , ipswich i have been motivated to open new savings accounts so as to spread our savings and therefore acquire protection brian roberts , sandbach the northern rock saga made me aware of the limited guarantee on bank savings .
before the previous weekend i had wrongly assumed all of my savings were protected if a major uk bank were to become insolvent .
given the relatively low limits , i have been motivated to open new savings accounts so as to spread our savings and therefore acquire protection , up to the standard limits , on each account .
one of the accounts i opened today was with northern rock where i have deposited £ 2,000 .
no matter what happens to the bank this amount will be guaranteed ? even if the recent government undertaking is withdrawn .
it has just occurred to me that if a significant proportion of investors followed suit they would both spread their personal risk and help the bank to recover .
brian roberts , sandbach if the money markets wo n't lend money to northern rock , why on earth should depositors lend them their money ?
steve frost , billingham i have been trying to access my online account since friday 14th september , not to withdraw all my money but simply to get sufficient funds out to pay for a new kitchen i am having fitted .
i ca n't get through and am so exasperated that when , -lrb- or if -rrb- , i eventually do succeed i will almost certainly withdraw all my funds and never trust an online account again !
anonymous the people most worried about northern rock collapsing are -lrb- understandably -rrb- contributing to that collapse becoming a reality chris grey , guildford the irony is that the people most worried about northern rock collapsing are -lrb- understandably -rrb- contributing to that collapse becoming a reality .
a good defensive strategy is never to put all one 's savings with one provider .
also no more than £ 35,000 of savings should be placed with any one organisation so as to make best use of the financial compensation scheme .
this strategy can be thwarted by mergers and takeovers .
for example , anyone whose savings were split between the nationwide and the portman should rethink calmly in the wake of the recent takeover .
chris grey , guildford i 'm a northern rock online customer and have been unable to access my account since last thursday .
the lack of service alone is reason enough to close my account .
paul , london i agree that customers have only been given re-assurances rather than a solid guarantee by either northern rock , the fsa , bank of england or the government .
i was not alarmed by the first announcement on thursday , but i am now !
i still can not access my money which is my only source of immediate funds .
sharon field , morpeth , northumberland where is a safe haven for my cash now ?
rob , sheffield after 36 hours of trying i finally got into my online account at northern rock .
if they do n't go bust before the bacs transfer , my £ 30k is as safe as hsbc for now ...
amongst the " reassurances " that our money was safe i heard no guarantees only opinions .
if -lrb- sorry , when -rrb- northern rock goes legs up i feel quite confident that its savers be the losers .
where is a safe haven for my cash now ?
which institution will be next on the list ?
i do n't have all my eggs in one basket but that does n't mean i would accept the loss of one basket of £ 30k with equanimity .
i want to be at the head of the queue next time , not battling for 36 hours .
rob , sheffield there may be a lot of people in debt in the country , but those who do have savings are likely to be quite prudent , probably risk-averse people .
i am not at all surprised that , in the circumstances , they are taking the precaution of getting their money back .
for anyone with good life savings - perhaps from the maturing of a pension or endowments - a compensation scheme which only partially covers the first £ 30-odd thousand is wholly inadequate .
what is more , people rightly think that , should they lose money in excess of this , there will be a deafening silence from the financial authorities and the government .
just look at the paltry amounts they have offered to people who lost pensions when companies closed - and only then after massive arm-twisting .
alison keys , brigg , north lincolnshire when things go wrong , we , the customers , pay the price , not the boards of directors cath , ipswich if i had cash with northern rock i would be right there in that queue .
i have no trust in any financial institution whatsoever .
i do n't think i am alone in that attitude .
ask those who , in past crises , have lost their pensions , homes or life-savings .
were they not given the same assurances ?
we are obliged to use " financial services " .
when things go wrong , we , the customers , pay the price , not the boards of directors .
cath , ipswich i tried all day with the website yesterday and even got up at 2am to try again .
like your listeners , i was convinced they were blocking access .
however at 9am today i got through and have closed my account .
i feel bad about it because i realise it could cause them even more problems .
sarah , manchester all your commentators are whistling in the wind .
there has been a long series of events -lrb- equitable life , pensions , endowment mortgages -rrb- in the course of which , the government and other organisations have shown that the customer or employee will be last in the line to be compensated if the business does collapse .
people know that others have lost everything in the past .
northern rock can not be held responsible for poor communication when the cause has been years of experience .
ms h. cook , birmingham the bbc made a big fuss about the bank of england loaning money to northern rock : if it was trivial why did the bbc lead so many of their news bulletins with that ?
mark , sidcup you spent half your programme complaining the northern rock website could n't cope with the surge in activity .
just how much must these banks spend on computers to cope with a once in eighty years surge in activity ?
you seem to be saying no one should worry , but the bbc made a big fuss about the bank of england loaning money to northern rock : if it was trivial why did the bbc lead so many of their news bulletins with that ?
mark , sidcup would there be any possibility that there is a move to push northern rock out of business - a competitor , or other commercial motive ?
what would the conspiracy theorists out there say ?
amanda clegg , godalming we kept being told that equitable life was solvent but people still lost a lot of money .
andrew , tunbridge wells the bottom line is - no one has any confidence or trust in the financial institutions , financial experts and politicians .
as an equitable life member , the consumers have the power to act , and they have .
trevor ingman , fittleworth , west sussex in view of northern rock 's current woes , it seems extraordinary that they have no information about the crisis on their website , other than the stock exchange statement issued yesterday .
what an appalling example of customer relations .
ignoring the problem on their website is not a solution .
terry cartwright , farnham , surrey as a northern rock customer , i am most annoyed that there is no way to access my savings .
they are in an online account and northern rock says the account can only be accessed via the web , not phone or branch visit .
the website has not functioned since at least thursday evening .
if the bank wishes to avoid panic , it should provide some means to access funds .
bob grindrod , huntingdon there are reports today that northern rock customers have withdrawn some £ 1bn .
however , presumably these are customers with access to northern rock branches .
for those , such as ourselves , who have an internet account , it has been impossible over the last couple of days to log-on , either because the site says that it is " experiencing technical problems " or , more recently , because the site is very busy - " please try again " .
one " tries again " repeatedly with the same lack of success .
is northern rock deliberately frustrating the wishes of internet customers to carry out transactions ?
hein velissarides , woking i was n't going to panic until i saw the run on northern rock jackie palfreman , balintore , highlands what about internet customers who can not storm and panic and withdraw their money ?
it should have been foreseen that people would panic and a block should have put on withdrawing their money - at least until calm and common sense could prevail .

jeremy wheeler , reading in the northern rock crisis , the chancellor , the fsa and the bank of england are all telling savers not to panic and deal as normal , but thousands of online savers can not access their money because the online section of the northern rock website does not work .
whether this is due to overload or technical problems is not clear but the perception could be that it has been switched off .
what a simple way to stop outflow .
online savers have been given no explanation or been offered any alternative means of accessing their savings .
is it any wonder no one believes anything they are told from on high these days ?
alan morris , glasgow if i withdraw my savings will i get my money or simply compound the problem ?
angela , kidderminster my life 's savings are in northern rock .
i only hold a postal account .
although very concerned , i understood the need for people not to panic and to allow the systems put in place by the bank of england to flow into action .
however , like me , people are concerned that they will lose their savings , hence the huge queues !
what should i do ?
if i withdraw my savings will i get my money or simply compound the problem ?
will northern rock even open the post to address all these queries , or can i demand my money at the counter like everyone else ?
very concerned pensioner , angela , kidderminster surely northern rock should have been put into some form of administration as part of the bank of england bail-out , heading off the stampede that is threatening to ruin non-panickers such as myself .
while i would like to agree with the comment of paul lewis on tv this morning that the bank of england can not afford to let rock go bust , what does that really mean for savers - and how long are the guarantees and assurances of the chancellor , the fsa , angela knight et al good for ?
colin mcalpin , tonbridge the current crisis at northern rock suggests that it is time for the current financial compensation system to be raised from the existing 100 % of the first £ 2000 and 90 % of the next £ 33,000 to a more realistic level .
brian kelly , didcot if the government and bank of england are convinced that northern rock is a sound business , then why do n't they declare that all investors have 100 % security backed by the government ?
that would surely then stem the run on the bank .
andrew , bristol the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .
it is helpful if contributors state if they work for any organisation relevant to an issue discussed .
readers should form their own views on whether messages published represent undeclared interests , or views prompted by a common source .

tennessee reviewed its lethal injection procedures in april , but the judge said by failing to safeguard prisoners against pain , the new protocol could " result in a terrifying , excruciating death " .
