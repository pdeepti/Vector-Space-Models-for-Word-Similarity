but while top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , löw insists there is much more than just finances behind the issue .
" the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer that the german clubs , " löw told german tabloid bild .

" this laboratory will be recreating a mini-version of the big bang , " said horst stöcker , the gsi scientific director , referring to the primal explosion 14 billion years ago with which the existence of the universe began . recreating the start of the universe - sort of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " primordial soup " will be one area of research " the substance we 'll be making resembles that in the first microseconds of the big bang , when it was a million times hotter than at the center of the sun .
we 're talking a million times 10 million degrees celsius . " the 3,000 scientists to work at fair will find out how the different chemical elements developed . stöcker said he can not guess what the answers will be , but added that fair will be darmstadt 's key laboratory for the next 25 years . past gsi achievements include discovering short-lived , new heavy elements such as element 108 , hassium , and element 110 , darmstadtium , which is named after the city of darmstadt . scientists believe that all the elements heavier than iron arose from supernovae , or explosions of stars , and will also reconstruct these events in fair , which is a double ring with a circumference of 1,100 meters -lrb- 3,609 feet -rrb- . lightspeed crashes planned in darmstadt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the particle accelerator unilac in darmstadt an existing particle accelerator at gsi will be re-used as a kind of first stage in the new facility , which will accelerate particles to 99 percent of the speed of light , then crash them into atomic nuclei . unlike another famous accelerator , at cern near geneva in switzerland , fair 's specialty will not be the speed of the particles , but rather the intensity of the beam . " with cern , it 's like getting a look at a new country at high speed from the highway , " spokesman ingo peter said .
" with fair , it will be like 1,000 four-wheel-drives swarming over it off-road . " we have different scientific purposes .
cern scientists can tell you how the far side looks .
we 'll be able to tell you about the fine detail of this new country : matter . " germany is to pay 75 percent of the costs of fair , with the other 14 nations , also including spain , britain , poland , china and russia , contributing the rest . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

d 'hont is set to publish a second book early next year after his first book claimed he saw 1997 tour winner ullrich being injected with epo .

since d 'hont , who worked for team telekom from 1992 to 1996 , first made his accusations , a number of former telekom stars , including 1996 tour de france winner riis , have admitted using substances like epo , which increases red-blood cell production .

" germany needs to look somewhat closer at the existing business ties with iran , " merkel said through a translator .
" there are certain companies that have business with iran .
we have already done that .
and we need to look , as the situation unfolds , whether we have to have a closer look again . "
bush and merkel emphasized they were committed to resolving the dispute with iran diplomatically , although bush has not ruled out the use of military strikes against iranian targets if tehran does not suspend enriching uranium , a process that can be used to develop a nuclear bomb .
iran insists its nuclear ambitions are limited to producing civilian energy .
" what the iranian regime must understand is that we will continue to work together to solve this problem diplomatically , which means they will continue to be isolated , " bush said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit marks an historic moment in relations merkel 's visit to bush 's remote ranch marked the first time in more than 40 years a german leader has met with an american president at his private residence and was the latest sign of how strong us-german relations have become since the fallout over the war in iraq .
us-french relations are also on the mend , symbolized earlier this week by the visit of president nicolas sarkozy that included red carpet treatment at the white house and meetings at the mansion outside the us capital that once belonged to the first us president , george washington .
germany , along with three permanent members of the security council - britain , france and the united states - have been pushing for another round of international sanctions on iran , but have faced resistance from china and russia , two other permanent members who wield veto authority .
the security council has already approved two resolutions with limited sanctions to compel iran to halt uranium enrichment and cooperate with the un nuclear monitoring body known as the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
hot topics on the agenda in crawford bush and merkel also discussed a host of other issues , including iraq , the war on terrorism in afghanistan , resolving the final status of kosovo , lebanon and us plans to host a conference this autumn in annapolis , maryland , hoping to make progress on a peace settlement to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remained firm on germany 's role in afghanistan merkel arrived at bush 's ranch friday evening for two days of talks .

" germany needs to look somewhat closer at the existing business ties with iran , " merkel said through a translator .
" there are certain companies that have business with iran .
we have already done that .
and we need to look , as the situation unfolds , whether we have to have a closer look again . "
bush and merkel emphasized they were committed to resolving the dispute with iran diplomatically , although bush has not ruled out the use of military strikes against iranian targets if tehran does not suspend enriching uranium , a process that can be used to develop a nuclear bomb .
iran insists its nuclear ambitions are limited to producing civilian energy .
" what the iranian regime must understand is that we will continue to work together to solve this problem diplomatically , which means they will continue to be isolated , " bush said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit marks an historic moment in relations merkel 's visit to bush 's remote ranch marked the first time in more than 40 years a german leader has met with an american president at his private residence and was the latest sign of how strong us-german relations have become since the fallout over the war in iraq .
us-french relations are also on the mend , symbolized earlier this week by the visit of president nicolas sarkozy that included red carpet treatment at the white house and meetings at the mansion outside the us capital that once belonged to the first us president , george washington .
germany , along with three permanent members of the security council - britain , france and the united states - have been pushing for another round of international sanctions on iran , but have faced resistance from china and russia , two other permanent members who wield veto authority .
the security council has already approved two resolutions with limited sanctions to compel iran to halt uranium enrichment and cooperate with the un nuclear monitoring body known as the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
hot topics on the agenda in crawford bush and merkel also discussed a host of other issues , including iraq , the war on terrorism in afghanistan , resolving the final status of kosovo , lebanon and us plans to host a conference this autumn in annapolis , maryland , hoping to make progress on a peace settlement to the israeli-palestinian conflict .

yet it is not only business competitors who may try to gain secret access to german expertise , it is also foreign intelligence services that are spying on german companies . whether it 's research results , strategies for development , product information , client data or budget plans - business secrets of successful companies are increasingly becoming coveted by industrious spies . the spies , said elmar remberg , deputy chief of the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- germany 's domestic intelligence agency -rrb- , come from the former republics of the soviet union , but primarily , from china . " china is intensively collecting information around the world - political , military and scientific data , and company strategies in order close the gap in their technology developments as quickly as possible , " remberg said . current studies show that around 40 percent of german companies fall prey to industrial espionage .
furthermore , expertise worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- is at risk , according to the studies .

former employees and partners were responsible for 28 percent , he said . " abuse can come in many forms , " fromm said .
" and as our firewalls , virus protection devices , passwords and biometic access portals become more refined , so too do the spies .
they find ever cleverer ways of getting around things . " more and more e-mail spying internet-based assaults from outside are also increasing .
recent reports that attacks on german government computers came from china have been confirmed , said remberg of the federal office for the protection of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government confirmed electronic attacks stemming from china " since 2005 , we have been finding such e-mail-based electronic attacks on german government offices and companies , " remberg said .

collected information is then sent back over the internet .
often , the programs are so well-made , that even specialists can not detect them . and there are other weak points , said michael hange , deputy chief of the german federal office for information security .

yet it is not only business competitors who may try to gain secret access to german expertise , it is also foreign intelligence services that are spying on german companies . whether it 's research results , strategies for development , product information , client data or budget plans - business secrets of successful companies are increasingly becoming coveted by industrious spies . the spies , said elmar remberg , deputy chief of the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- germany 's domestic intelligence agency -rrb- , come from the former republics of the soviet union , but primarily , from china . " china is intensively collecting information around the world - political , military and scientific data , and company strategies in order close the gap in their technology developments as quickly as possible , " remberg said . current studies show that around 40 percent of german companies fall prey to industrial espionage .
furthermore , expertise worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- is at risk , according to the studies .

former employees and partners were responsible for 28 percent , he said . " abuse can come in many forms , " fromm said .
" and as our firewalls , virus protection devices , passwords and biometic access portals become more refined , so too do the spies .
they find ever cleverer ways of getting around things . " more and more e-mail spying internet-based assaults from outside are also increasing .

yet it is not only business competitors who may try to gain secret access to german expertise , it is also foreign intelligence services that are spying on german companies . whether it 's research results , strategies for development , product information , client data or budget plans - business secrets of successful companies are increasingly becoming coveted by industrious spies . the spies , said elmar remberg , deputy chief of the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- germany 's domestic intelligence agency -rrb- , come from the former republics of the soviet union , but primarily , from china . " china is intensively collecting information around the world - political , military and scientific data , and company strategies in order close the gap in their technology developments as quickly as possible , " remberg said . current studies show that around 40 percent of german companies fall prey to industrial espionage .
furthermore , expertise worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- is at risk , according to the studies .
the target of the espionage are primarily nano and armament technologies , as well as that involving transportation , environment and energy . mid-sized businesses especially at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer systems are particularly at risk andreas blume , who is responsible for protecting new scientific findings at the chemicals company evonik-degussa , said small and mid-sized companies that are leaders in their field are especially at risk .
he said he is often approched at seminars , workshops and conferences . " alarm bells should go off whenever someone is willing to pay for your flight , accommodations or entertainment , " blume said .
" but a lot of mid-sized companies are blinded by the generous offerrs and later , they 've given away their information . " blume is also familiar with some of the tricks the intelligence services use : supposed document shredders that are actually equipped with internal shredders and umts transmitters , beamers that record presentations and usb sticks with so-called trojan horse programs that allow hackers to spy on computers . according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , chinese case officers go undercover and work as journalists and diplomats in germany , or visit trade fairs and companies with delegations . insiders pose major threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees often pass on too much information leaks from inside firms are increasing in number - companies that take on interns from abroad are at risk , for example . hansjörg fromm , director of the ibm european center for business optimization in germany , said he seen studies that show that in 2005 , more than a third of assaults on security are due to breaches among employees of companies .
former employees and partners were responsible for 28 percent , he said . " abuse can come in many forms , " fromm said .
" and as our firewalls , virus protection devices , passwords and biometic access portals become more refined , so too do the spies .
they find ever cleverer ways of getting around things . " more and more e-mail spying internet-based assaults from outside are also increasing .
recent reports that attacks on german government computers came from china have been confirmed , said remberg of the federal office for the protection of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government confirmed electronic attacks stemming from china " since 2005 , we have been finding such e-mail-based electronic attacks on german government offices and companies , " remberg said .
" these are pursued with incredible intensity ; currently , an attack is detected every one to two days . " e-mails can contain spy programs that automatically install themselves without the user noticing .
collected information is then sent back over the internet .
often , the programs are so well-made , that even specialists can not detect them . and there are other weak points , said michael hange , deputy chief of the german federal office for information security .
" w-lan and mobile communication are popular points of assault , " he said . a company in thailand , for instance , offers monitoring services of cell phone conversations . " you only have to get a hold of your parnter 's cell phone and type in a few commands and then you can monitor all the calls , " hange said . experts say , however , that there is no way to protect against industrial espionage one hundred percent .
they recommend that companies have a good it security plan and stress that managers of companies must be more aware of the dangers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 11.11.2007 foreign intelligence services spy on german companies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial espionage is often done over digital lines germany is the land of ideas and innovations .
yet it is not only business competitors who may try to gain secret access to german expertise , it is also foreign intelligence services that are spying on german companies . whether it 's research results , strategies for development , product information , client data or budget plans - business secrets of successful companies are increasingly becoming coveted by industrious spies . the spies , said elmar remberg , deputy chief of the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- germany 's domestic intelligence agency -rrb- , come from the former republics of the soviet union , but primarily , from china . " china is intensively collecting information around the world - political , military and scientific data , and company strategies in order close the gap in their technology developments as quickly as possible , " remberg said . current studies show that around 40 percent of german companies fall prey to industrial espionage .
furthermore , expertise worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- is at risk , according to the studies .
the target of the espionage are primarily nano and armament technologies , as well as that involving transportation , environment and energy . mid-sized businesses especially at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer systems are particularly at risk andreas blume , who is responsible for protecting new scientific findings at the chemicals company evonik-degussa , said small and mid-sized companies that are leaders in their field are especially at risk .
he said he is often approched at seminars , workshops and conferences . " alarm bells should go off whenever someone is willing to pay for your flight , accommodations or entertainment , " blume said .
" but a lot of mid-sized companies are blinded by the generous offerrs and later , they 've given away their information . " blume is also familiar with some of the tricks the intelligence services use : supposed document shredders that are actually equipped with internal shredders and umts transmitters , beamers that record presentations and usb sticks with so-called trojan horse programs that allow hackers to spy on computers . according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , chinese case officers go undercover and work as journalists and diplomats in germany , or visit trade fairs and companies with delegations . insiders pose major threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees often pass on too much information leaks from inside firms are increasing in number - companies that take on interns from abroad are at risk , for example . hansjörg fromm , director of the ibm european center for business optimization in germany , said he seen studies that show that in 2005 , more than a third of assaults on security are due to breaches among employees of companies .
former employees and partners were responsible for 28 percent , he said . " abuse can come in many forms , " fromm said .
" and as our firewalls , virus protection devices , passwords and biometic access portals become more refined , so too do the spies .
they find ever cleverer ways of getting around things . " more and more e-mail spying internet-based assaults from outside are also increasing .
recent reports that attacks on german government computers came from china have been confirmed , said remberg of the federal office for the protection of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government confirmed electronic attacks stemming from china " since 2005 , we have been finding such e-mail-based electronic attacks on german government offices and companies , " remberg said .
" these are pursued with incredible intensity ; currently , an attack is detected every one to two days . " e-mails can contain spy programs that automatically install themselves without the user noticing .
collected information is then sent back over the internet .
often , the programs are so well-made , that even specialists can not detect them . and there are other weak points , said michael hange , deputy chief of the german federal office for information security .
" w-lan and mobile communication are popular points of assault , " he said . a company in thailand , for instance , offers monitoring services of cell phone conversations . " you only have to get a hold of your parnter 's cell phone and type in a few commands and then you can monitor all the calls , " hange said . experts say , however , that there is no way to protect against industrial espionage one hundred percent .
they recommend that companies have a good it security plan and stress that managers of companies must be more aware of the dangers .
employees must also be trained , even if they are trusted . sabine kinkartz -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" blume is also familiar with some of the tricks the intelligence services use : supposed document shredders that are actually equipped with internal shredders and umts transmitters , beamers that record presentations and usb sticks with so-called trojan horse programs that allow hackers to spy on computers . according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , chinese case officers go undercover and work as journalists and diplomats in germany , or visit trade fairs and companies with delegations . insiders pose major threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees often pass on too much information leaks from inside firms are increasing in number - companies that take on interns from abroad are at risk , for example . hansjörg fromm , director of the ibm european center for business optimization in germany , said he seen studies that show that in 2005 , more than a third of assaults on security are due to breaches among employees of companies .
former employees and partners were responsible for 28 percent , he said . " abuse can come in many forms , " fromm said .
" and as our firewalls , virus protection devices , passwords and biometic access portals become more refined , so too do the spies .
they find ever cleverer ways of getting around things . " more and more e-mail spying internet-based assaults from outside are also increasing .
recent reports that attacks on german government computers came from china have been confirmed , said remberg of the federal office for the protection of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government confirmed electronic attacks stemming from china " since 2005 , we have been finding such e-mail-based electronic attacks on german government offices and companies , " remberg said .
" these are pursued with incredible intensity ; currently , an attack is detected every one to two days . " e-mails can contain spy programs that automatically install themselves without the user noticing .
collected information is then sent back over the internet .
often , the programs are so well-made , that even specialists can not detect them . and there are other weak points , said michael hange , deputy chief of the german federal office for information security .
" w-lan and mobile communication are popular points of assault , " he said . a company in thailand , for instance , offers monitoring services of cell phone conversations . " you only have to get a hold of your parnter 's cell phone and type in a few commands and then you can monitor all the calls , " hange said . experts say , however , that there is no way to protect against industrial espionage one hundred percent .
they recommend that companies have a good it security plan and stress that managers of companies must be more aware of the dangers .
employees must also be trained , even if they are trusted . sabine kinkartz -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany needs to look somewhat closer at the existing business ties with iran , " merkel said through a translator .
" there are certain companies that have business with iran .
we have already done that .
and we need to look , as the situation unfolds , whether we have to have a closer look again . "
bush and merkel emphasized they were committed to resolving the dispute with iran diplomatically , although bush has not ruled out the use of military strikes against iranian targets if tehran does not suspend enriching uranium , a process that can be used to develop a nuclear bomb .
iran insists its nuclear ambitions are limited to producing civilian energy .
" what the iranian regime must understand is that we will continue to work together to solve this problem diplomatically , which means they will continue to be isolated , " bush said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit marks an historic moment in relations merkel 's visit to bush 's remote ranch marked the first time in more than 40 years a german leader has met with an american president at his private residence and was the latest sign of how strong us-german relations have become since the fallout over the war in iraq .
us-french relations are also on the mend , symbolized earlier this week by the visit of president nicolas sarkozy that included red carpet treatment at the white house and meetings at the mansion outside the us capital that once belonged to the first us president , george washington .
germany , along with three permanent members of the security council - britain , france and the united states - have been pushing for another round of international sanctions on iran , but have faced resistance from china and russia , two other permanent members who wield veto authority .
the security council has already approved two resolutions with limited sanctions to compel iran to halt uranium enrichment and cooperate with the un nuclear monitoring body known as the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
hot topics on the agenda in crawford bush and merkel also discussed a host of other issues , including iraq , the war on terrorism in afghanistan , resolving the final status of kosovo , lebanon and us plans to host a conference this autumn in annapolis , maryland , hoping to make progress on a peace settlement to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remained firm on germany 's role in afghanistan merkel arrived at bush 's ranch friday evening for two days of talks .
she reiterated her country 's commitment to stabilizing and rebuilding afghanistan .
germany has about 3,000 troops in afghanistan , but they are limited to a peacekeeping role in relatively safe areas and are forbidden from joining us and nato forces in southern afghanistan fighting against al qaeda and the taliban .
" we need to do more in order to help them continue to build up the police and to continue to also build up the army there , improve that , and go on with the training that we have already embarked on , " merkel said .
merkel throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also expressed support for the israel-palestinian peace conference reportedly to take place in late november .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been traveling to the middle east in recent weeks trying to organize the conference that will include other arabic countries - possibly even syria .
" we want the peace process to make progress , and we think that the conference , the upcoming conference in annapolis is indeed a possibility to bring this success about , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and rice are driving the west 's efforts for peace rice has been urging israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas to agree to a framework for the conference she hopes will lay the groundwork for the creation of a palestinian state .

" germany needs to look somewhat closer at the existing business ties with iran , " merkel said through a translator .
" there are certain companies that have business with iran .
we have already done that .
and we need to look , as the situation unfolds , whether we have to have a closer look again . "
bush and merkel emphasized they were committed to resolving the dispute with iran diplomatically , although bush has not ruled out the use of military strikes against iranian targets if tehran does not suspend enriching uranium , a process that can be used to develop a nuclear bomb .
iran insists its nuclear ambitions are limited to producing civilian energy .
" what the iranian regime must understand is that we will continue to work together to solve this problem diplomatically , which means they will continue to be isolated , " bush said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit marks an historic moment in relations merkel 's visit to bush 's remote ranch marked the first time in more than 40 years a german leader has met with an american president at his private residence and was the latest sign of how strong us-german relations have become since the fallout over the war in iraq .
us-french relations are also on the mend , symbolized earlier this week by the visit of president nicolas sarkozy that included red carpet treatment at the white house and meetings at the mansion outside the us capital that once belonged to the first us president , george washington .
germany , along with three permanent members of the security council - britain , france and the united states - have been pushing for another round of international sanctions on iran , but have faced resistance from china and russia , two other permanent members who wield veto authority .
the security council has already approved two resolutions with limited sanctions to compel iran to halt uranium enrichment and cooperate with the un nuclear monitoring body known as the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
hot topics on the agenda in crawford bush and merkel also discussed a host of other issues , including iraq , the war on terrorism in afghanistan , resolving the final status of kosovo , lebanon and us plans to host a conference this autumn in annapolis , maryland , hoping to make progress on a peace settlement to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remained firm on germany 's role in afghanistan merkel arrived at bush 's ranch friday evening for two days of talks .
she reiterated her country 's commitment to stabilizing and rebuilding afghanistan .
germany has about 3,000 troops in afghanistan , but they are limited to a peacekeeping role in relatively safe areas and are forbidden from joining us and nato forces in southern afghanistan fighting against al qaeda and the taliban .
" we need to do more in order to help them continue to build up the police and to continue to also build up the army there , improve that , and go on with the training that we have already embarked on , " merkel said .
merkel throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also expressed support for the israel-palestinian peace conference reportedly to take place in late november .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been traveling to the middle east in recent weeks trying to organize the conference that will include other arabic countries - possibly even syria .
" we want the peace process to make progress , and we think that the conference , the upcoming conference in annapolis is indeed a possibility to bring this success about , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and rice are driving the west 's efforts for peace rice has been urging israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas to agree to a framework for the conference she hopes will lay the groundwork for the creation of a palestinian state .
bush and merkel also discussed trade and global warming .
merkel said he hopes the united states will participate in a un climate change conference in bali in december .
merkel has been a leading international advocate for rallying governments to take steps to slow global warming .

d 'hont is set to publish a second book early next year after his first book claimed he saw 1997 tour winner ullrich being injected with epo .
ullrich , 33 , retired from cycling in february after he was sacked in july 2006 by t-mobile , who changed their name from deutsche telekom in 2004 .
the german has always denied doping even when pockets of his blood were found in the cabinet of eufemiano fuentes , the spanish doctor whose doping network was dismantled by operation puerto last year .
allegations of ullrich doping pile-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pevenage told d 'hont that ullrich was using epo d 'hont told a nightly german tv news program in june that there was no doubt ullrich used banned substances .
he also urged the 1997 tour de france winner to come clean .
the allegations about doping during team telekom 's glory years in the mid-1990s were n't new .
but they did increase the pressure on ullrich as the only major rider from the team at that time not to have admitted using banned substances .
" with one hundred percent certainty , jan took epo and human growth hormones , " d 'hont told the tv news show " tagesthemen , " one of the most-watched programs of its kind in germany .
" like bjarne riis , rolf aldag and the other members of the team , jan has to admit how it was . "

" germany needs to look somewhat closer at the existing business ties with iran , " merkel said through a translator .
" there are certain companies that have business with iran .
we have already done that .
and we need to look , as the situation unfolds , whether we have to have a closer look again . "
bush and merkel emphasized they were committed to resolving the dispute with iran diplomatically , although bush has not ruled out the use of military strikes against iranian targets if tehran does not suspend enriching uranium , a process that can be used to develop a nuclear bomb .
iran insists its nuclear ambitions are limited to producing civilian energy .
" what the iranian regime must understand is that we will continue to work together to solve this problem diplomatically , which means they will continue to be isolated , " bush said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit marks an historic moment in relations merkel 's visit to bush 's remote ranch marked the first time in more than 40 years a german leader has met with an american president at his private residence and was the latest sign of how strong us-german relations have become since the fallout over the war in iraq .
us-french relations are also on the mend , symbolized earlier this week by the visit of president nicolas sarkozy that included red carpet treatment at the white house and meetings at the mansion outside the us capital that once belonged to the first us president , george washington .
germany , along with three permanent members of the security council - britain , france and the united states - have been pushing for another round of international sanctions on iran , but have faced resistance from china and russia , two other permanent members who wield veto authority .
the security council has already approved two resolutions with limited sanctions to compel iran to halt uranium enrichment and cooperate with the un nuclear monitoring body known as the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
hot topics on the agenda in crawford bush and merkel also discussed a host of other issues , including iraq , the war on terrorism in afghanistan , resolving the final status of kosovo , lebanon and us plans to host a conference this autumn in annapolis , maryland , hoping to make progress on a peace settlement to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remained firm on germany 's role in afghanistan merkel arrived at bush 's ranch friday evening for two days of talks .
she reiterated her country 's commitment to stabilizing and rebuilding afghanistan .
germany has about 3,000 troops in afghanistan , but they are limited to a peacekeeping role in relatively safe areas and are forbidden from joining us and nato forces in southern afghanistan fighting against al qaeda and the taliban .
" we need to do more in order to help them continue to build up the police and to continue to also build up the army there , improve that , and go on with the training that we have already embarked on , " merkel said .
merkel throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also expressed support for the israel-palestinian peace conference reportedly to take place in late november .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been traveling to the middle east in recent weeks trying to organize the conference that will include other arabic countries - possibly even syria .
" we want the peace process to make progress , and we think that the conference , the upcoming conference in annapolis is indeed a possibility to bring this success about , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and rice are driving the west 's efforts for peace rice has been urging israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas to agree to a framework for the conference she hopes will lay the groundwork for the creation of a palestinian state .
bush and merkel also discussed trade and global warming .
merkel said he hopes the united states will participate in a un climate change conference in bali in december .
merkel has been a leading international advocate for rallying governments to take steps to slow global warming .
bush non-commital on germany 's un ambitions the two leaders also discussed un reform , particularly on the security council , where germany has been seeking permanent membership .

" germany needs to look somewhat closer at the existing business ties with iran , " merkel said through a translator .
" there are certain companies that have business with iran .
we have already done that .
and we need to look , as the situation unfolds , whether we have to have a closer look again . "
bush and merkel emphasized they were committed to resolving the dispute with iran diplomatically , although bush has not ruled out the use of military strikes against iranian targets if tehran does not suspend enriching uranium , a process that can be used to develop a nuclear bomb .
iran insists its nuclear ambitions are limited to producing civilian energy .
" what the iranian regime must understand is that we will continue to work together to solve this problem diplomatically , which means they will continue to be isolated , " bush said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit marks an historic moment in relations merkel 's visit to bush 's remote ranch marked the first time in more than 40 years a german leader has met with an american president at his private residence and was the latest sign of how strong us-german relations have become since the fallout over the war in iraq .
us-french relations are also on the mend , symbolized earlier this week by the visit of president nicolas sarkozy that included red carpet treatment at the white house and meetings at the mansion outside the us capital that once belonged to the first us president , george washington .
germany , along with three permanent members of the security council - britain , france and the united states - have been pushing for another round of international sanctions on iran , but have faced resistance from china and russia , two other permanent members who wield veto authority .
the security council has already approved two resolutions with limited sanctions to compel iran to halt uranium enrichment and cooperate with the un nuclear monitoring body known as the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
hot topics on the agenda in crawford bush and merkel also discussed a host of other issues , including iraq , the war on terrorism in afghanistan , resolving the final status of kosovo , lebanon and us plans to host a conference this autumn in annapolis , maryland , hoping to make progress on a peace settlement to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remained firm on germany 's role in afghanistan merkel arrived at bush 's ranch friday evening for two days of talks .
she reiterated her country 's commitment to stabilizing and rebuilding afghanistan .
germany has about 3,000 troops in afghanistan , but they are limited to a peacekeeping role in relatively safe areas and are forbidden from joining us and nato forces in southern afghanistan fighting against al qaeda and the taliban .
" we need to do more in order to help them continue to build up the police and to continue to also build up the army there , improve that , and go on with the training that we have already embarked on , " merkel said .
merkel throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also expressed support for the israel-palestinian peace conference reportedly to take place in late november .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been traveling to the middle east in recent weeks trying to organize the conference that will include other arabic countries - possibly even syria .
" we want the peace process to make progress , and we think that the conference , the upcoming conference in annapolis is indeed a possibility to bring this success about , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and rice are driving the west 's efforts for peace rice has been urging israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas to agree to a framework for the conference she hopes will lay the groundwork for the creation of a palestinian state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 11.11.2007 foreign intelligence services spy on german companies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial espionage is often done over digital lines germany is the land of ideas and innovations .
yet it is not only business competitors who may try to gain secret access to german expertise , it is also foreign intelligence services that are spying on german companies . whether it 's research results , strategies for development , product information , client data or budget plans - business secrets of successful companies are increasingly becoming coveted by industrious spies . the spies , said elmar remberg , deputy chief of the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- germany 's domestic intelligence agency -rrb- , come from the former republics of the soviet union , but primarily , from china . " china is intensively collecting information around the world - political , military and scientific data , and company strategies in order close the gap in their technology developments as quickly as possible , " remberg said . current studies show that around 40 percent of german companies fall prey to industrial espionage .
furthermore , expertise worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- is at risk , according to the studies .
the target of the espionage are primarily nano and armament technologies , as well as that involving transportation , environment and energy . mid-sized businesses especially at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer systems are particularly at risk andreas blume , who is responsible for protecting new scientific findings at the chemicals company evonik-degussa , said small and mid-sized companies that are leaders in their field are especially at risk .
he said he is often approched at seminars , workshops and conferences . " alarm bells should go off whenever someone is willing to pay for your flight , accommodations or entertainment , " blume said .
" but a lot of mid-sized companies are blinded by the generous offerrs and later , they 've given away their information . " blume is also familiar with some of the tricks the intelligence services use : supposed document shredders that are actually equipped with internal shredders and umts transmitters , beamers that record presentations and usb sticks with so-called trojan horse programs that allow hackers to spy on computers . according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , chinese case officers go undercover and work as journalists and diplomats in germany , or visit trade fairs and companies with delegations . insiders pose major threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees often pass on too much information leaks from inside firms are increasing in number - companies that take on interns from abroad are at risk , for example . hansjörg fromm , director of the ibm european center for business optimization in germany , said he seen studies that show that in 2005 , more than a third of assaults on security are due to breaches among employees of companies .
former employees and partners were responsible for 28 percent , he said . " abuse can come in many forms , " fromm said .
" and as our firewalls , virus protection devices , passwords and biometic access portals become more refined , so too do the spies .
they find ever cleverer ways of getting around things . " more and more e-mail spying internet-based assaults from outside are also increasing .
recent reports that attacks on german government computers came from china have been confirmed , said remberg of the federal office for the protection of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government confirmed electronic attacks stemming from china " since 2005 , we have been finding such e-mail-based electronic attacks on german government offices and companies , " remberg said .
" these are pursued with incredible intensity ; currently , an attack is detected every one to two days . " e-mails can contain spy programs that automatically install themselves without the user noticing .
collected information is then sent back over the internet .
often , the programs are so well-made , that even specialists can not detect them . and there are other weak points , said michael hange , deputy chief of the german federal office for information security .
" w-lan and mobile communication are popular points of assault , " he said . a company in thailand , for instance , offers monitoring services of cell phone conversations . " you only have to get a hold of your parnter 's cell phone and type in a few commands and then you can monitor all the calls , " hange said . experts say , however , that there is no way to protect against industrial espionage one hundred percent .
they recommend that companies have a good it security plan and stress that managers of companies must be more aware of the dangers .
employees must also be trained , even if they are trusted . sabine kinkartz -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this laboratory will be recreating a mini-version of the big bang , " said horst stöcker , the gsi scientific director , referring to the primal explosion 14 billion years ago with which the existence of the universe began . recreating the start of the universe - sort of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " primordial soup " will be one area of research " the substance we 'll be making resembles that in the first microseconds of the big bang , when it was a million times hotter than at the center of the sun .
we 're talking a million times 10 million degrees celsius . " the 3,000 scientists to work at fair will find out how the different chemical elements developed . stöcker said he can not guess what the answers will be , but added that fair will be darmstadt 's key laboratory for the next 25 years . past gsi achievements include discovering short-lived , new heavy elements such as element 108 , hassium , and element 110 , darmstadtium , which is named after the city of darmstadt . scientists believe that all the elements heavier than iron arose from supernovae , or explosions of stars , and will also reconstruct these events in fair , which is a double ring with a circumference of 1,100 meters -lrb- 3,609 feet -rrb- . lightspeed crashes planned in darmstadt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the particle accelerator unilac in darmstadt an existing particle accelerator at gsi will be re-used as a kind of first stage in the new facility , which will accelerate particles to 99 percent of the speed of light , then crash them into atomic nuclei . unlike another famous accelerator , at cern near geneva in switzerland , fair 's specialty will not be the speed of the particles , but rather the intensity of the beam . " with cern , it 's like getting a look at a new country at high speed from the highway , " spokesman ingo peter said .
" with fair , it will be like 1,000 four-wheel-drives swarming over it off-road . " we have different scientific purposes .
cern scientists can tell you how the far side looks .
we 'll be able to tell you about the fine detail of this new country : matter . " germany is to pay 75 percent of the costs of fair , with the other 14 nations , also including spain , britain , poland , china and russia , contributing the rest . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet it is not only business competitors who may try to gain secret access to german expertise , it is also foreign intelligence services that are spying on german companies . whether it 's research results , strategies for development , product information , client data or budget plans - business secrets of successful companies are increasingly becoming coveted by industrious spies . the spies , said elmar remberg , deputy chief of the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- germany 's domestic intelligence agency -rrb- , come from the former republics of the soviet union , but primarily , from china . " china is intensively collecting information around the world - political , military and scientific data , and company strategies in order close the gap in their technology developments as quickly as possible , " remberg said . current studies show that around 40 percent of german companies fall prey to industrial espionage .
furthermore , expertise worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- is at risk , according to the studies .
the target of the espionage are primarily nano and armament technologies , as well as that involving transportation , environment and energy . mid-sized businesses especially at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer systems are particularly at risk andreas blume , who is responsible for protecting new scientific findings at the chemicals company evonik-degussa , said small and mid-sized companies that are leaders in their field are especially at risk .
he said he is often approched at seminars , workshops and conferences . " alarm bells should go off whenever someone is willing to pay for your flight , accommodations or entertainment , " blume said .

former employees and partners were responsible for 28 percent , he said . " abuse can come in many forms , " fromm said .
" and as our firewalls , virus protection devices , passwords and biometic access portals become more refined , so too do the spies .

recent reports that attacks on german government computers came from china have been confirmed , said remberg of the federal office for the protection of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government confirmed electronic attacks stemming from china " since 2005 , we have been finding such e-mail-based electronic attacks on german government offices and companies , " remberg said .
" these are pursued with incredible intensity ; currently , an attack is detected every one to two days . " e-mails can contain spy programs that automatically install themselves without the user noticing .

" and as our firewalls , virus protection devices , passwords and biometic access portals become more refined , so too do the spies .
they find ever cleverer ways of getting around things . " more and more e-mail spying internet-based assaults from outside are also increasing .
recent reports that attacks on german government computers came from china have been confirmed , said remberg of the federal office for the protection of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government confirmed electronic attacks stemming from china " since 2005 , we have been finding such e-mail-based electronic attacks on german government offices and companies , " remberg said .
" these are pursued with incredible intensity ; currently , an attack is detected every one to two days . " e-mails can contain spy programs that automatically install themselves without the user noticing .
collected information is then sent back over the internet .
often , the programs are so well-made , that even specialists can not detect them . and there are other weak points , said michael hange , deputy chief of the german federal office for information security .
" w-lan and mobile communication are popular points of assault , " he said . a company in thailand , for instance , offers monitoring services of cell phone conversations . " you only have to get a hold of your parnter 's cell phone and type in a few commands and then you can monitor all the calls , " hange said . experts say , however , that there is no way to protect against industrial espionage one hundred percent .
they recommend that companies have a good it security plan and stress that managers of companies must be more aware of the dangers .
employees must also be trained , even if they are trusted . sabine kinkartz -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , löw insists there is much more than just finances behind the issue .
" the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer that the german clubs , " löw told german tabloid bild .
bundesliga teams should focus on development " but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years , " löw added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw and his coaches have focused on player development " i can only really talk in terms of selection for the german team and for the last two years i have insisted on attack , technique and developing strong characters .
and those characteristics are something we are developing in germany . "
after four rounds of champions league group games , schalke and werder bremen must win their last two games to have any chance of making the last 16 , while stuttgart are out after four defeats germany 's elite three sides have suffered nine defeats in twelve matches .
germany 's strongest side bayern munich are top of their uefa cup group with a win and a draw , but bayern 's chairman of the board karl-heinz rummenigge says german clubs need to attract investors .
he also suggested bundesliga clubs should be given their share of tv money depending on their results , rather than the current system where all 18 clubs are given an equal share .
" it is obvious that stuttgart , for example , give more to the bundesliga than say energie cottbus or vfl bochum , " he told german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate , verheugen told reporters , focused on " how does it affect our economies , how does it affect our consumers .
how do we react if and when we recognize that china does not fully respect the rules , to put it very mildly ? "
" would a joint effort to convince china that it is in china 's interest to fully respect the rules be more useful than individual approaches which we have used ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 11.11.2007 foreign intelligence services spy on german companies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial espionage is often done over digital lines germany is the land of ideas and innovations .
yet it is not only business competitors who may try to gain secret access to german expertise , it is also foreign intelligence services that are spying on german companies . whether it 's research results , strategies for development , product information , client data or budget plans - business secrets of successful companies are increasingly becoming coveted by industrious spies . the spies , said elmar remberg , deputy chief of the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- germany 's domestic intelligence agency -rrb- , come from the former republics of the soviet union , but primarily , from china . " china is intensively collecting information around the world - political , military and scientific data , and company strategies in order close the gap in their technology developments as quickly as possible , " remberg said . current studies show that around 40 percent of german companies fall prey to industrial espionage .
furthermore , expertise worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- is at risk , according to the studies .
the target of the espionage are primarily nano and armament technologies , as well as that involving transportation , environment and energy . mid-sized businesses especially at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer systems are particularly at risk andreas blume , who is responsible for protecting new scientific findings at the chemicals company evonik-degussa , said small and mid-sized companies that are leaders in their field are especially at risk .
he said he is often approched at seminars , workshops and conferences . " alarm bells should go off whenever someone is willing to pay for your flight , accommodations or entertainment , " blume said .
" but a lot of mid-sized companies are blinded by the generous offerrs and later , they 've given away their information . " blume is also familiar with some of the tricks the intelligence services use : supposed document shredders that are actually equipped with internal shredders and umts transmitters , beamers that record presentations and usb sticks with so-called trojan horse programs that allow hackers to spy on computers . according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , chinese case officers go undercover and work as journalists and diplomats in germany , or visit trade fairs and companies with delegations . insiders pose major threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees often pass on too much information leaks from inside firms are increasing in number - companies that take on interns from abroad are at risk , for example . hansjörg fromm , director of the ibm european center for business optimization in germany , said he seen studies that show that in 2005 , more than a third of assaults on security are due to breaches among employees of companies .
former employees and partners were responsible for 28 percent , he said . " abuse can come in many forms , " fromm said .
" and as our firewalls , virus protection devices , passwords and biometic access portals become more refined , so too do the spies .
they find ever cleverer ways of getting around things . " more and more e-mail spying internet-based assaults from outside are also increasing .

" germany needs to look somewhat closer at the existing business ties with iran , " merkel said through a translator .
" there are certain companies that have business with iran .
we have already done that .
and we need to look , as the situation unfolds , whether we have to have a closer look again . "
bush and merkel emphasized they were committed to resolving the dispute with iran diplomatically , although bush has not ruled out the use of military strikes against iranian targets if tehran does not suspend enriching uranium , a process that can be used to develop a nuclear bomb .
iran insists its nuclear ambitions are limited to producing civilian energy .
" what the iranian regime must understand is that we will continue to work together to solve this problem diplomatically , which means they will continue to be isolated , " bush said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit marks an historic moment in relations merkel 's visit to bush 's remote ranch marked the first time in more than 40 years a german leader has met with an american president at his private residence and was the latest sign of how strong us-german relations have become since the fallout over the war in iraq .
us-french relations are also on the mend , symbolized earlier this week by the visit of president nicolas sarkozy that included red carpet treatment at the white house and meetings at the mansion outside the us capital that once belonged to the first us president , george washington .
germany , along with three permanent members of the security council - britain , france and the united states - have been pushing for another round of international sanctions on iran , but have faced resistance from china and russia , two other permanent members who wield veto authority .
the security council has already approved two resolutions with limited sanctions to compel iran to halt uranium enrichment and cooperate with the un nuclear monitoring body known as the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
hot topics on the agenda in crawford bush and merkel also discussed a host of other issues , including iraq , the war on terrorism in afghanistan , resolving the final status of kosovo , lebanon and us plans to host a conference this autumn in annapolis , maryland , hoping to make progress on a peace settlement to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remained firm on germany 's role in afghanistan merkel arrived at bush 's ranch friday evening for two days of talks .
she reiterated her country 's commitment to stabilizing and rebuilding afghanistan .
germany has about 3,000 troops in afghanistan , but they are limited to a peacekeeping role in relatively safe areas and are forbidden from joining us and nato forces in southern afghanistan fighting against al qaeda and the taliban .
" we need to do more in order to help them continue to build up the police and to continue to also build up the army there , improve that , and go on with the training that we have already embarked on , " merkel said .
merkel throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also expressed support for the israel-palestinian peace conference reportedly to take place in late november .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been traveling to the middle east in recent weeks trying to organize the conference that will include other arabic countries - possibly even syria .
" we want the peace process to make progress , and we think that the conference , the upcoming conference in annapolis is indeed a possibility to bring this success about , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and rice are driving the west 's efforts for peace rice has been urging israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas to agree to a framework for the conference she hopes will lay the groundwork for the creation of a palestinian state .
bush and merkel also discussed trade and global warming .
merkel said he hopes the united states will participate in a un climate change conference in bali in december .
merkel has been a leading international advocate for rallying governments to take steps to slow global warming .
bush non-commital on germany 's un ambitions the two leaders also discussed un reform , particularly on the security council , where germany has been seeking permanent membership .

" germany needs to look somewhat closer at the existing business ties with iran , " merkel said through a translator .
" there are certain companies that have business with iran .
we have already done that .
and we need to look , as the situation unfolds , whether we have to have a closer look again . "
bush and merkel emphasized they were committed to resolving the dispute with iran diplomatically , although bush has not ruled out the use of military strikes against iranian targets if tehran does not suspend enriching uranium , a process that can be used to develop a nuclear bomb .
iran insists its nuclear ambitions are limited to producing civilian energy .
" what the iranian regime must understand is that we will continue to work together to solve this problem diplomatically , which means they will continue to be isolated , " bush said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit marks an historic moment in relations merkel 's visit to bush 's remote ranch marked the first time in more than 40 years a german leader has met with an american president at his private residence and was the latest sign of how strong us-german relations have become since the fallout over the war in iraq .
us-french relations are also on the mend , symbolized earlier this week by the visit of president nicolas sarkozy that included red carpet treatment at the white house and meetings at the mansion outside the us capital that once belonged to the first us president , george washington .
germany , along with three permanent members of the security council - britain , france and the united states - have been pushing for another round of international sanctions on iran , but have faced resistance from china and russia , two other permanent members who wield veto authority .
the security council has already approved two resolutions with limited sanctions to compel iran to halt uranium enrichment and cooperate with the un nuclear monitoring body known as the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
hot topics on the agenda in crawford bush and merkel also discussed a host of other issues , including iraq , the war on terrorism in afghanistan , resolving the final status of kosovo , lebanon and us plans to host a conference this autumn in annapolis , maryland , hoping to make progress on a peace settlement to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remained firm on germany 's role in afghanistan merkel arrived at bush 's ranch friday evening for two days of talks .
she reiterated her country 's commitment to stabilizing and rebuilding afghanistan .
germany has about 3,000 troops in afghanistan , but they are limited to a peacekeeping role in relatively safe areas and are forbidden from joining us and nato forces in southern afghanistan fighting against al qaeda and the taliban .
" we need to do more in order to help them continue to build up the police and to continue to also build up the army there , improve that , and go on with the training that we have already embarked on , " merkel said .
merkel throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also expressed support for the israel-palestinian peace conference reportedly to take place in late november .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been traveling to the middle east in recent weeks trying to organize the conference that will include other arabic countries - possibly even syria .
" we want the peace process to make progress , and we think that the conference , the upcoming conference in annapolis is indeed a possibility to bring this success about , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and rice are driving the west 's efforts for peace rice has been urging israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas to agree to a framework for the conference she hopes will lay the groundwork for the creation of a palestinian state .
bush and merkel also discussed trade and global warming .
merkel said he hopes the united states will participate in a un climate change conference in bali in december .
merkel has been a leading international advocate for rallying governments to take steps to slow global warming .
bush non-commital on germany 's un ambitions the two leaders also discussed un reform , particularly on the security council , where germany has been seeking permanent membership .
the only country the united states openly backs is japan , and bush was noncommittal when asked about germany 's ambitions .
" japan should have a seat , " bush said .

yet it is not only business competitors who may try to gain secret access to german expertise , it is also foreign intelligence services that are spying on german companies . whether it 's research results , strategies for development , product information , client data or budget plans - business secrets of successful companies are increasingly becoming coveted by industrious spies . the spies , said elmar remberg , deputy chief of the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- germany 's domestic intelligence agency -rrb- , come from the former republics of the soviet union , but primarily , from china . " china is intensively collecting information around the world - political , military and scientific data , and company strategies in order close the gap in their technology developments as quickly as possible , " remberg said . current studies show that around 40 percent of german companies fall prey to industrial espionage .
furthermore , expertise worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- is at risk , according to the studies .
the target of the espionage are primarily nano and armament technologies , as well as that involving transportation , environment and energy . mid-sized businesses especially at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer systems are particularly at risk andreas blume , who is responsible for protecting new scientific findings at the chemicals company evonik-degussa , said small and mid-sized companies that are leaders in their field are especially at risk .
he said he is often approched at seminars , workshops and conferences . " alarm bells should go off whenever someone is willing to pay for your flight , accommodations or entertainment , " blume said .
" but a lot of mid-sized companies are blinded by the generous offerrs and later , they 've given away their information . " blume is also familiar with some of the tricks the intelligence services use : supposed document shredders that are actually equipped with internal shredders and umts transmitters , beamers that record presentations and usb sticks with so-called trojan horse programs that allow hackers to spy on computers . according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , chinese case officers go undercover and work as journalists and diplomats in germany , or visit trade fairs and companies with delegations . insiders pose major threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees often pass on too much information leaks from inside firms are increasing in number - companies that take on interns from abroad are at risk , for example . hansjörg fromm , director of the ibm european center for business optimization in germany , said he seen studies that show that in 2005 , more than a third of assaults on security are due to breaches among employees of companies .
former employees and partners were responsible for 28 percent , he said . " abuse can come in many forms , " fromm said .
" and as our firewalls , virus protection devices , passwords and biometic access portals become more refined , so too do the spies .
they find ever cleverer ways of getting around things . " more and more e-mail spying internet-based assaults from outside are also increasing .
recent reports that attacks on german government computers came from china have been confirmed , said remberg of the federal office for the protection of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government confirmed electronic attacks stemming from china " since 2005 , we have been finding such e-mail-based electronic attacks on german government offices and companies , " remberg said .
" these are pursued with incredible intensity ; currently , an attack is detected every one to two days . " e-mails can contain spy programs that automatically install themselves without the user noticing .
collected information is then sent back over the internet .
often , the programs are so well-made , that even specialists can not detect them . and there are other weak points , said michael hange , deputy chief of the german federal office for information security .
" w-lan and mobile communication are popular points of assault , " he said . a company in thailand , for instance , offers monitoring services of cell phone conversations . " you only have to get a hold of your parnter 's cell phone and type in a few commands and then you can monitor all the calls , " hange said . experts say , however , that there is no way to protect against industrial espionage one hundred percent .
they recommend that companies have a good it security plan and stress that managers of companies must be more aware of the dangers .
employees must also be trained , even if they are trusted . sabine kinkartz -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , löw insists there is much more than just finances behind the issue .
" the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer that the german clubs , " löw told german tabloid bild .
bundesliga teams should focus on development " but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years , " löw added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw and his coaches have focused on player development " i can only really talk in terms of selection for the german team and for the last two years i have insisted on attack , technique and developing strong characters .
and those characteristics are something we are developing in germany . "
after four rounds of champions league group games , schalke and werder bremen must win their last two games to have any chance of making the last 16 , while stuttgart are out after four defeats germany 's elite three sides have suffered nine defeats in twelve matches .
germany 's strongest side bayern munich are top of their uefa cup group with a win and a draw , but bayern 's chairman of the board karl-heinz rummenigge says german clubs need to attract investors .
he also suggested bundesliga clubs should be given their share of tv money depending on their results , rather than the current system where all 18 clubs are given an equal share .
" it is obvious that stuttgart , for example , give more to the bundesliga than say energie cottbus or vfl bochum , " he told german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this laboratory will be recreating a mini-version of the big bang , " said horst stöcker , the gsi scientific director , referring to the primal explosion 14 billion years ago with which the existence of the universe began . recreating the start of the universe - sort of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " primordial soup " will be one area of research " the substance we 'll be making resembles that in the first microseconds of the big bang , when it was a million times hotter than at the center of the sun .
we 're talking a million times 10 million degrees celsius . " the 3,000 scientists to work at fair will find out how the different chemical elements developed . stöcker said he can not guess what the answers will be , but added that fair will be darmstadt 's key laboratory for the next 25 years . past gsi achievements include discovering short-lived , new heavy elements such as element 108 , hassium , and element 110 , darmstadtium , which is named after the city of darmstadt . scientists believe that all the elements heavier than iron arose from supernovae , or explosions of stars , and will also reconstruct these events in fair , which is a double ring with a circumference of 1,100 meters -lrb- 3,609 feet -rrb- . lightspeed crashes planned in darmstadt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the particle accelerator unilac in darmstadt an existing particle accelerator at gsi will be re-used as a kind of first stage in the new facility , which will accelerate particles to 99 percent of the speed of light , then crash them into atomic nuclei . unlike another famous accelerator , at cern near geneva in switzerland , fair 's specialty will not be the speed of the particles , but rather the intensity of the beam . " with cern , it 's like getting a look at a new country at high speed from the highway , " spokesman ingo peter said .
" with fair , it will be like 1,000 four-wheel-drives swarming over it off-road . " we have different scientific purposes .
cern scientists can tell you how the far side looks .
we 'll be able to tell you about the fine detail of this new country : matter . " germany is to pay 75 percent of the costs of fair , with the other 14 nations , also including spain , britain , poland , china and russia , contributing the rest . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 11.11.2007 foreign intelligence services spy on german companies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial espionage is often done over digital lines germany is the land of ideas and innovations .
yet it is not only business competitors who may try to gain secret access to german expertise , it is also foreign intelligence services that are spying on german companies . whether it 's research results , strategies for development , product information , client data or budget plans - business secrets of successful companies are increasingly becoming coveted by industrious spies . the spies , said elmar remberg , deputy chief of the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- germany 's domestic intelligence agency -rrb- , come from the former republics of the soviet union , but primarily , from china . " china is intensively collecting information around the world - political , military and scientific data , and company strategies in order close the gap in their technology developments as quickly as possible , " remberg said . current studies show that around 40 percent of german companies fall prey to industrial espionage .
furthermore , expertise worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- is at risk , according to the studies .
the target of the espionage are primarily nano and armament technologies , as well as that involving transportation , environment and energy . mid-sized businesses especially at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer systems are particularly at risk andreas blume , who is responsible for protecting new scientific findings at the chemicals company evonik-degussa , said small and mid-sized companies that are leaders in their field are especially at risk .
he said he is often approched at seminars , workshops and conferences . " alarm bells should go off whenever someone is willing to pay for your flight , accommodations or entertainment , " blume said .
" but a lot of mid-sized companies are blinded by the generous offerrs and later , they 've given away their information . " blume is also familiar with some of the tricks the intelligence services use : supposed document shredders that are actually equipped with internal shredders and umts transmitters , beamers that record presentations and usb sticks with so-called trojan horse programs that allow hackers to spy on computers . according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , chinese case officers go undercover and work as journalists and diplomats in germany , or visit trade fairs and companies with delegations . insiders pose major threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees often pass on too much information leaks from inside firms are increasing in number - companies that take on interns from abroad are at risk , for example . hansjörg fromm , director of the ibm european center for business optimization in germany , said he seen studies that show that in 2005 , more than a third of assaults on security are due to breaches among employees of companies .
former employees and partners were responsible for 28 percent , he said . " abuse can come in many forms , " fromm said .
" and as our firewalls , virus protection devices , passwords and biometic access portals become more refined , so too do the spies .
they find ever cleverer ways of getting around things . " more and more e-mail spying internet-based assaults from outside are also increasing .
recent reports that attacks on german government computers came from china have been confirmed , said remberg of the federal office for the protection of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government confirmed electronic attacks stemming from china " since 2005 , we have been finding such e-mail-based electronic attacks on german government offices and companies , " remberg said .
" these are pursued with incredible intensity ; currently , an attack is detected every one to two days . " e-mails can contain spy programs that automatically install themselves without the user noticing .
collected information is then sent back over the internet .
often , the programs are so well-made , that even specialists can not detect them . and there are other weak points , said michael hange , deputy chief of the german federal office for information security .
" w-lan and mobile communication are popular points of assault , " he said . a company in thailand , for instance , offers monitoring services of cell phone conversations . " you only have to get a hold of your parnter 's cell phone and type in a few commands and then you can monitor all the calls , " hange said . experts say , however , that there is no way to protect against industrial espionage one hundred percent .
they recommend that companies have a good it security plan and stress that managers of companies must be more aware of the dangers .
employees must also be trained , even if they are trusted . sabine kinkartz -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet it is not only business competitors who may try to gain secret access to german expertise , it is also foreign intelligence services that are spying on german companies . whether it 's research results , strategies for development , product information , client data or budget plans - business secrets of successful companies are increasingly becoming coveted by industrious spies . the spies , said elmar remberg , deputy chief of the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- germany 's domestic intelligence agency -rrb- , come from the former republics of the soviet union , but primarily , from china . " china is intensively collecting information around the world - political , military and scientific data , and company strategies in order close the gap in their technology developments as quickly as possible , " remberg said . current studies show that around 40 percent of german companies fall prey to industrial espionage .
furthermore , expertise worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- is at risk , according to the studies .
the target of the espionage are primarily nano and armament technologies , as well as that involving transportation , environment and energy . mid-sized businesses especially at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer systems are particularly at risk andreas blume , who is responsible for protecting new scientific findings at the chemicals company evonik-degussa , said small and mid-sized companies that are leaders in their field are especially at risk .
he said he is often approched at seminars , workshops and conferences . " alarm bells should go off whenever someone is willing to pay for your flight , accommodations or entertainment , " blume said .
" but a lot of mid-sized companies are blinded by the generous offerrs and later , they 've given away their information . " blume is also familiar with some of the tricks the intelligence services use : supposed document shredders that are actually equipped with internal shredders and umts transmitters , beamers that record presentations and usb sticks with so-called trojan horse programs that allow hackers to spy on computers . according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , chinese case officers go undercover and work as journalists and diplomats in germany , or visit trade fairs and companies with delegations . insiders pose major threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees often pass on too much information leaks from inside firms are increasing in number - companies that take on interns from abroad are at risk , for example . hansjörg fromm , director of the ibm european center for business optimization in germany , said he seen studies that show that in 2005 , more than a third of assaults on security are due to breaches among employees of companies .
former employees and partners were responsible for 28 percent , he said . " abuse can come in many forms , " fromm said .
" and as our firewalls , virus protection devices , passwords and biometic access portals become more refined , so too do the spies .
they find ever cleverer ways of getting around things . " more and more e-mail spying internet-based assaults from outside are also increasing .
recent reports that attacks on german government computers came from china have been confirmed , said remberg of the federal office for the protection of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government confirmed electronic attacks stemming from china " since 2005 , we have been finding such e-mail-based electronic attacks on german government offices and companies , " remberg said .
" these are pursued with incredible intensity ; currently , an attack is detected every one to two days . " e-mails can contain spy programs that automatically install themselves without the user noticing .
collected information is then sent back over the internet .
often , the programs are so well-made , that even specialists can not detect them . and there are other weak points , said michael hange , deputy chief of the german federal office for information security .
" w-lan and mobile communication are popular points of assault , " he said . a company in thailand , for instance , offers monitoring services of cell phone conversations . " you only have to get a hold of your parnter 's cell phone and type in a few commands and then you can monitor all the calls , " hange said . experts say , however , that there is no way to protect against industrial espionage one hundred percent .
they recommend that companies have a good it security plan and stress that managers of companies must be more aware of the dangers .
employees must also be trained , even if they are trusted . sabine kinkartz -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany needs to look somewhat closer at the existing business ties with iran , " merkel said through a translator .
" there are certain companies that have business with iran .
we have already done that .
and we need to look , as the situation unfolds , whether we have to have a closer look again . "
bush and merkel emphasized they were committed to resolving the dispute with iran diplomatically , although bush has not ruled out the use of military strikes against iranian targets if tehran does not suspend enriching uranium , a process that can be used to develop a nuclear bomb .
iran insists its nuclear ambitions are limited to producing civilian energy .
" what the iranian regime must understand is that we will continue to work together to solve this problem diplomatically , which means they will continue to be isolated , " bush said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit marks an historic moment in relations merkel 's visit to bush 's remote ranch marked the first time in more than 40 years a german leader has met with an american president at his private residence and was the latest sign of how strong us-german relations have become since the fallout over the war in iraq .
us-french relations are also on the mend , symbolized earlier this week by the visit of president nicolas sarkozy that included red carpet treatment at the white house and meetings at the mansion outside the us capital that once belonged to the first us president , george washington .
germany , along with three permanent members of the security council - britain , france and the united states - have been pushing for another round of international sanctions on iran , but have faced resistance from china and russia , two other permanent members who wield veto authority .
the security council has already approved two resolutions with limited sanctions to compel iran to halt uranium enrichment and cooperate with the un nuclear monitoring body known as the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
hot topics on the agenda in crawford bush and merkel also discussed a host of other issues , including iraq , the war on terrorism in afghanistan , resolving the final status of kosovo , lebanon and us plans to host a conference this autumn in annapolis , maryland , hoping to make progress on a peace settlement to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remained firm on germany 's role in afghanistan merkel arrived at bush 's ranch friday evening for two days of talks .
she reiterated her country 's commitment to stabilizing and rebuilding afghanistan .
germany has about 3,000 troops in afghanistan , but they are limited to a peacekeeping role in relatively safe areas and are forbidden from joining us and nato forces in southern afghanistan fighting against al qaeda and the taliban .
" we need to do more in order to help them continue to build up the police and to continue to also build up the army there , improve that , and go on with the training that we have already embarked on , " merkel said .
merkel throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also expressed support for the israel-palestinian peace conference reportedly to take place in late november .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been traveling to the middle east in recent weeks trying to organize the conference that will include other arabic countries - possibly even syria .
" we want the peace process to make progress , and we think that the conference , the upcoming conference in annapolis is indeed a possibility to bring this success about , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and rice are driving the west 's efforts for peace rice has been urging israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas to agree to a framework for the conference she hopes will lay the groundwork for the creation of a palestinian state .
bush and merkel also discussed trade and global warming .
merkel said he hopes the united states will participate in a un climate change conference in bali in december .
merkel has been a leading international advocate for rallying governments to take steps to slow global warming .
bush non-commital on germany 's un ambitions the two leaders also discussed un reform , particularly on the security council , where germany has been seeking permanent membership .
the only country the united states openly backs is japan , and bush was noncommittal when asked about germany 's ambitions .

but while top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , löw insists there is much more than just finances behind the issue .
" the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer that the german clubs , " löw told german tabloid bild .
bundesliga teams should focus on development " but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years , " löw added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw and his coaches have focused on player development " i can only really talk in terms of selection for the german team and for the last two years i have insisted on attack , technique and developing strong characters .
and those characteristics are something we are developing in germany . "
after four rounds of champions league group games , schalke and werder bremen must win their last two games to have any chance of making the last 16 , while stuttgart are out after four defeats germany 's elite three sides have suffered nine defeats in twelve matches .
germany 's strongest side bayern munich are top of their uefa cup group with a win and a draw , but bayern 's chairman of the board karl-heinz rummenigge says german clubs need to attract investors .
he also suggested bundesliga clubs should be given their share of tv money depending on their results , rather than the current system where all 18 clubs are given an equal share .
" it is obvious that stuttgart , for example , give more to the bundesliga than say energie cottbus or vfl bochum , " he told german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate , verheugen told reporters , focused on " how does it affect our economies , how does it affect our consumers .
how do we react if and when we recognize that china does not fully respect the rules , to put it very mildly ? "
" would a joint effort to convince china that it is in china 's interest to fully respect the rules be more useful than individual approaches which we have used ?
that is the kind of question that we have discussed , " the eu official added .
hubbard said how china deals with international trade has wide-ranging effects .
china 's trade attitude has global effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade in pirated products goes relatively unchecked in china " when china does not follow intellectual property rules and regulations , that affects not only the us ; it affects europe .
when china is an export-oriented economy , an economy that encourages local consumption , domestic consumption , that affects both our economies .
when they peg their currency , that affects both economies , " he said .

but while top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , löw insists there is much more than just finances behind the issue .
" the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer that the german clubs , " löw told german tabloid bild .
bundesliga teams should focus on development " but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years , " löw added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw and his coaches have focused on player development " i can only really talk in terms of selection for the german team and for the last two years i have insisted on attack , technique and developing strong characters .
and those characteristics are something we are developing in germany . "
after four rounds of champions league group games , schalke and werder bremen must win their last two games to have any chance of making the last 16 , while stuttgart are out after four defeats germany 's elite three sides have suffered nine defeats in twelve matches .
germany 's strongest side bayern munich are top of their uefa cup group with a win and a draw , but bayern 's chairman of the board karl-heinz rummenigge says german clubs need to attract investors .
he also suggested bundesliga clubs should be given their share of tv money depending on their results , rather than the current system where all 18 clubs are given an equal share .
" it is obvious that stuttgart , for example , give more to the bundesliga than say energie cottbus or vfl bochum , " he told german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 11.11.2007 merkel advocates strong sanctions on iran after bush meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush found common ground on iran but remained at odds on other topics the un security council must be prepared to enact strong sanctions if iran fails to comply with demands to halt uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear activities , german chancellor angela merkel said . merkel , speaking saturday after a meeting with us president george w bush at his ranch in crawford , texas , also said she will urge german business to reduce ties to iran in an effort to step up pressure on the iranian regime because of its suspected pursuit of nuclear weapons .
" germany needs to look somewhat closer at the existing business ties with iran , " merkel said through a translator .
" there are certain companies that have business with iran .
we have already done that .
and we need to look , as the situation unfolds , whether we have to have a closer look again . "
bush and merkel emphasized they were committed to resolving the dispute with iran diplomatically , although bush has not ruled out the use of military strikes against iranian targets if tehran does not suspend enriching uranium , a process that can be used to develop a nuclear bomb .
iran insists its nuclear ambitions are limited to producing civilian energy .
" what the iranian regime must understand is that we will continue to work together to solve this problem diplomatically , which means they will continue to be isolated , " bush said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit marks an historic moment in relations merkel 's visit to bush 's remote ranch marked the first time in more than 40 years a german leader has met with an american president at his private residence and was the latest sign of how strong us-german relations have become since the fallout over the war in iraq .
us-french relations are also on the mend , symbolized earlier this week by the visit of president nicolas sarkozy that included red carpet treatment at the white house and meetings at the mansion outside the us capital that once belonged to the first us president , george washington .
germany , along with three permanent members of the security council - britain , france and the united states - have been pushing for another round of international sanctions on iran , but have faced resistance from china and russia , two other permanent members who wield veto authority .
the security council has already approved two resolutions with limited sanctions to compel iran to halt uranium enrichment and cooperate with the un nuclear monitoring body known as the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
hot topics on the agenda in crawford bush and merkel also discussed a host of other issues , including iraq , the war on terrorism in afghanistan , resolving the final status of kosovo , lebanon and us plans to host a conference this autumn in annapolis , maryland , hoping to make progress on a peace settlement to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remained firm on germany 's role in afghanistan merkel arrived at bush 's ranch friday evening for two days of talks .
she reiterated her country 's commitment to stabilizing and rebuilding afghanistan .
germany has about 3,000 troops in afghanistan , but they are limited to a peacekeeping role in relatively safe areas and are forbidden from joining us and nato forces in southern afghanistan fighting against al qaeda and the taliban .
" we need to do more in order to help them continue to build up the police and to continue to also build up the army there , improve that , and go on with the training that we have already embarked on , " merkel said .
merkel throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also expressed support for the israel-palestinian peace conference reportedly to take place in late november .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been traveling to the middle east in recent weeks trying to organize the conference that will include other arabic countries - possibly even syria .
" we want the peace process to make progress , and we think that the conference , the upcoming conference in annapolis is indeed a possibility to bring this success about , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and rice are driving the west 's efforts for peace rice has been urging israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas to agree to a framework for the conference she hopes will lay the groundwork for the creation of a palestinian state .
bush and merkel also discussed trade and global warming .
merkel said he hopes the united states will participate in a un climate change conference in bali in december .
merkel has been a leading international advocate for rallying governments to take steps to slow global warming .
bush non-commital on germany 's un ambitions the two leaders also discussed un reform , particularly on the security council , where germany has been seeking permanent membership .

bush and merkel emphasized they were committed to resolving the dispute with iran diplomatically , although bush has not ruled out the use of military strikes against iranian targets if tehran does not suspend enriching uranium , a process that can be used to develop a nuclear bomb .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit marks an historic moment in relations merkel 's visit to bush 's remote ranch marked the first time in more than 40 years a german leader has met with an american president at his private residence and was the latest sign of how strong us-german relations have become since the fallout over the war in iraq .
us-french relations are also on the mend , symbolized earlier this week by the visit of president nicolas sarkozy that included red carpet treatment at the white house and meetings at the mansion outside the us capital that once belonged to the first us president , george washington .
germany , along with three permanent members of the security council - britain , france and the united states - have been pushing for another round of international sanctions on iran , but have faced resistance from china and russia , two other permanent members who wield veto authority .
the security council has already approved two resolutions with limited sanctions to compel iran to halt uranium enrichment and cooperate with the un nuclear monitoring body known as the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
hot topics on the agenda in crawford bush and merkel also discussed a host of other issues , including iraq , the war on terrorism in afghanistan , resolving the final status of kosovo , lebanon and us plans to host a conference this autumn in annapolis , maryland , hoping to make progress on a peace settlement to the israeli-palestinian conflict .

germany has about 3,000 troops in afghanistan , but they are limited to a peacekeeping role in relatively safe areas and are forbidden from joining us and nato forces in southern afghanistan fighting against al qaeda and the taliban .
" we need to do more in order to help them continue to build up the police and to continue to also build up the army there , improve that , and go on with the training that we have already embarked on , " merkel said .

but while top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , löw insists there is much more than just finances behind the issue .
" the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer that the german clubs , " löw told german tabloid bild .
bundesliga teams should focus on development " but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years , " löw added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw and his coaches have focused on player development " i can only really talk in terms of selection for the german team and for the last two years i have insisted on attack , technique and developing strong characters .
and those characteristics are something we are developing in germany . "
after four rounds of champions league group games , schalke and werder bremen must win their last two games to have any chance of making the last 16 , while stuttgart are out after four defeats germany 's elite three sides have suffered nine defeats in twelve matches .
germany 's strongest side bayern munich are top of their uefa cup group with a win and a draw , but bayern 's chairman of the board karl-heinz rummenigge says german clubs need to attract investors .
he also suggested bundesliga clubs should be given their share of tv money depending on their results , rather than the current system where all 18 clubs are given an equal share .
" it is obvious that stuttgart , for example , give more to the bundesliga than say energie cottbus or vfl bochum , " he told german newspaper stuttgarter zeitung . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit marks an historic moment in relations merkel 's visit to bush 's remote ranch marked the first time in more than 40 years a german leader has met with an american president at his private residence and was the latest sign of how strong us-german relations have become since the fallout over the war in iraq .
us-french relations are also on the mend , symbolized earlier this week by the visit of president nicolas sarkozy that included red carpet treatment at the white house and meetings at the mansion outside the us capital that once belonged to the first us president , george washington .
germany , along with three permanent members of the security council - britain , france and the united states - have been pushing for another round of international sanctions on iran , but have faced resistance from china and russia , two other permanent members who wield veto authority .
the security council has already approved two resolutions with limited sanctions to compel iran to halt uranium enrichment and cooperate with the un nuclear monitoring body known as the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
hot topics on the agenda in crawford bush and merkel also discussed a host of other issues , including iraq , the war on terrorism in afghanistan , resolving the final status of kosovo , lebanon and us plans to host a conference this autumn in annapolis , maryland , hoping to make progress on a peace settlement to the israeli-palestinian conflict .

" we need to do more in order to help them continue to build up the police and to continue to also build up the army there , improve that , and go on with the training that we have already embarked on , " merkel said .
merkel throws weight behind middle east peace process merkel also expressed support for the israel-palestinian peace conference reportedly to take place in late november .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been traveling to the middle east in recent weeks trying to organize the conference that will include other arabic countries - possibly even syria .
" we want the peace process to make progress , and we think that the conference , the upcoming conference in annapolis is indeed a possibility to bring this success about , " merkel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 11.11.2007 foreign intelligence services spy on german companies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrial espionage is often done over digital lines germany is the land of ideas and innovations .
yet it is not only business competitors who may try to gain secret access to german expertise , it is also foreign intelligence services that are spying on german companies . whether it 's research results , strategies for development , product information , client data or budget plans - business secrets of successful companies are increasingly becoming coveted by industrious spies . the spies , said elmar remberg , deputy chief of the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- germany 's domestic intelligence agency -rrb- , come from the former republics of the soviet union , but primarily , from china . " china is intensively collecting information around the world - political , military and scientific data , and company strategies in order close the gap in their technology developments as quickly as possible , " remberg said . current studies show that around 40 percent of german companies fall prey to industrial espionage .
furthermore , expertise worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- is at risk , according to the studies .
the target of the espionage are primarily nano and armament technologies , as well as that involving transportation , environment and energy . mid-sized businesses especially at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer systems are particularly at risk andreas blume , who is responsible for protecting new scientific findings at the chemicals company evonik-degussa , said small and mid-sized companies that are leaders in their field are especially at risk .
he said he is often approched at seminars , workshops and conferences . " alarm bells should go off whenever someone is willing to pay for your flight , accommodations or entertainment , " blume said .
" but a lot of mid-sized companies are blinded by the generous offerrs and later , they 've given away their information . " blume is also familiar with some of the tricks the intelligence services use : supposed document shredders that are actually equipped with internal shredders and umts transmitters , beamers that record presentations and usb sticks with so-called trojan horse programs that allow hackers to spy on computers . according to the federal office for the protection of the constitution , chinese case officers go undercover and work as journalists and diplomats in germany , or visit trade fairs and companies with delegations . insiders pose major threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees often pass on too much information leaks from inside firms are increasing in number - companies that take on interns from abroad are at risk , for example . hansjörg fromm , director of the ibm european center for business optimization in germany , said he seen studies that show that in 2005 , more than a third of assaults on security are due to breaches among employees of companies .
former employees and partners were responsible for 28 percent , he said . " abuse can come in many forms , " fromm said .
" and as our firewalls , virus protection devices , passwords and biometic access portals become more refined , so too do the spies .
they find ever cleverer ways of getting around things . " more and more e-mail spying internet-based assaults from outside are also increasing .
recent reports that attacks on german government computers came from china have been confirmed , said remberg of the federal office for the protection of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government confirmed electronic attacks stemming from china " since 2005 , we have been finding such e-mail-based electronic attacks on german government offices and companies , " remberg said .
" these are pursued with incredible intensity ; currently , an attack is detected every one to two days . " e-mails can contain spy programs that automatically install themselves without the user noticing .
collected information is then sent back over the internet .
often , the programs are so well-made , that even specialists can not detect them . and there are other weak points , said michael hange , deputy chief of the german federal office for information security .
" w-lan and mobile communication are popular points of assault , " he said . a company in thailand , for instance , offers monitoring services of cell phone conversations . " you only have to get a hold of your parnter 's cell phone and type in a few commands and then you can monitor all the calls , " hange said . experts say , however , that there is no way to protect against industrial espionage one hundred percent .
they recommend that companies have a good it security plan and stress that managers of companies must be more aware of the dangers .
employees must also be trained , even if they are trusted . sabine kinkartz -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , löw insists there is much more than just finances behind the issue .
" the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer that the german clubs , " löw told german tabloid bild .

d 'hont is set to publish a second book early next year after his first book claimed he saw 1997 tour winner ullrich being injected with epo .

" like bjarne riis , rolf aldag and the other members of the team , jan has to admit how it was . "
since d 'hont , who worked for team telekom from 1992 to 1996 , first made his accusations , a number of former telekom stars , including 1996 tour de france winner riis , have admitted using substances like epo , which increases red-blood cell production .

residents in llangadog said trucks and lorries were smashing into buildings that have already had thousands of pounds spent on them .
one property , once thought to have been a toll house , has been hit three times .
the townscape heritage initiative , which oversees the restoration work , said there was growing concern over the rise in traffic through the village .
around £ 1.5m is being spent restoring landmark properties in llangadog and llandovery .
the townscape officer for carmarthenshire council , roger morgan , said llangadog residents were convinced that satellite navigation was to blame for the damage .
" it 's a very small narrow road and these large lorries are coming through the village and causing problems for everyone , " he said . "
there has been a tremendous increase in traffic " roger morgan , townscape officer an office used by an architectural consultant in the village has taken the brunt of the damage .
" since the lime rendering has been applied to the front of the building it has been damaged at least three times , " said mr morgan .
' mounting concern ' in august , the vale of glamorgan council became so concerned over lorries being sent along narrow roads near st hilary it began trials of a sign warning drivers to ignore sat-nav directions .
in the same month , a polish lorry driver became trapped for three hours at ty croes in carmarthenshire after following sat-nav directions .
roger morgan said there was " mounting concern " in llangadog at the number of heavy vehicles using routes to cross from the black mountain in the brecon beacons through the llangadog area .
" there has been a tremendous increase in traffic and there 's no reason for it to come over the black mountain unless they have been directed that way , " he said .
" i think the thing is to stop them coming over the mountain by telling them not to use the route from a sat-nav point of view . "

aiming to cut the levels of yuan in circulation , the people 's bank of china is increasing the banking reserve ratio by half a percentage point to 13.5 % .
to take effect from 29 november , it will be a record high for the reserve ratio , and the ninth rise this year .
china 's inflation is near a 10-year high , driven by its booming economy .
chinese inflation hit 6.5 % in august , its highest level since 1997 , before declining slightly to 6.2 % in september .
october 's data , which is out on tuesday , is expected to show that inflation has risen again to 6.4 % .
the central bank predicts the chinese economy will grow at a breakneck 11 % this year , as exports continue to surge .
