" the relationship between europe and africa has been put on a new platform , " kufuor said .
" the two will now begin a new friendship and partnership that should have a very positive impact on the process of globalization . " second meeting ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another eu-africa meeting is slated for 2010 the two-day summit of 26 european and 53 african heads of government held talks on a sweeping range of issues , from energy and climate change to migration , science and security .
it was the two sides ' first meeting since 2000 , and only the second ever . at the end of the meeting they approved an eight-part agreement setting out how they should cooperate on those issues ahead of the next summit , scheduled to be held in africa in 2010 .
libya has already offered to host that summit . but the lisbon meeting was dominated by two issues : the state of democracy in zimbabwe and a bitter row over trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , which have been a bone of contention for over five years . merkel , mugabe exchange barbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe and merkel each received support from their continents ahead of the summit , zimbabwe seemed the more explosive issue .
eu leaders have long accused president robert mugabe of destroying his country 's democracy and economy , and britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to attend the summit because of mugabe 's presence . on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel accused mugabe 's regime of " damaging the image of the new africa " in comments echoed by the leaders of sweden , denmark and the netherlands . mugabe hit back on sunday , accusing his opponents of being brown 's " spokesmen " and of showing ignorance of zimbabwe in their speeches , and arrogance in their attitudes . " does the german chancellor and the pro-gordon gang of four really believe they have better knowledge of zimbabwe than the southern african development community -lrb- sadec -rrb- and the african union ? " he asked .
" it is this arrogance that we are fighting against . " trade differences remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wade said there would be time to talk about new trade deals in the future but the second day of talks was dominated by the trade issue .
the eu and four african regions have been negotiating for five years on a package of deals - the epas - which are meant to replace earlier agreements the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- had ruled illegal . the wto had set a deadline for the end of the year for the old deals to be replaced .
several african states have said that the eu is using that as an excuse to force them into unfair deals , and on sunday they appeared close to walking away from negotiations . " let 's not talk about the economic partnership agreements !

" when we meet again , we 'll discuss things , the eu will present their epas , and we will present something else . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who bears final responsibility for the eu in the talks , quickly pointed out that the eu only wanted to sign interim deals by the end of the year , and that he and colleagues would personally conduct talks on longer-term deals with their african counterparts early in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters called on the eu to offer african countries a fair economic deal wary of china 's growing push into africa , the european union has been keen to nail down new trade agreements before the expiration of existing deals at year 's end . historic mood " let 's conclude the interim deals first - it 's already almost finished with almost all the countries involved , " barroso said .

9 .
some observers have even called for a salary cap . social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- head kurt beck said saturday , dec .
8 , that his party was considering legislative ways to limit severance packages , often worth millions of euros , paid to business leaders . " i can understand people 's anger when managers get sent home with millions in compensation - even after a company is bankrupted , " beck told saturday 's bild zeitung , adding that while the business brass deserve fair pay the situation in some companies had gotten out of hand . beck 's comments come on the heels of chancellor angela merkel 's criticism of business directors who after failing their companies are rewarded with " fantastic bonuses . "
the head of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , merkel added that managers should be well paid as long as they " did a lot for their companies and their partners . " morals in the boardroom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany have called for more fairness from the country 's business leaders the european commission supported beck 's view .
vladimir spidla , the eu 's commissioner for employment and social affairs , told germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper that ethical business limits were " certainly exceeded " when top managers earn 100 times more than regular employees . in the interest of fairness to all , the head of germany 's protestant church , bishop wolfgang huber , called for a federal law limiting managers ' salaries . " it goes against every notion of fairness when one person 's salary could finance more than 100 jobs and a company has to cut jobs to save on costs , " he told the bild am sonntag . a survey published in the paper said about two-thirds of germans would be in favor of a salary cap . tact , transparency needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does not require public companies to reveal what they pay individual managers but federal economics minister michael glos , a cdu member , said private companies - not politicians - should determine what constitutes a fair severance package . " i am fundamentally against the state handing down rules from on high , " he told the bild .
" instead i hope for tact and a sense of responsibility . " interior minister wolfgang schäuble , also of the cdu , said he was against legislating managers ' pay and on sunday called on companies to stop writing " unacceptably high " paychecks . he also said publically listed companies should disclose how much they pay their directors and that laws forcing companies unwilling to do so was in an interview with the welt am sonntag , he said , " transparency rules making it mandatory for public companies to disclose the actual payments made to managers " would be " worth considering .

it was the two sides ' first meeting since 2000 , and only the second ever . at the end of the meeting they approved an eight-part agreement setting out how they should cooperate on those issues ahead of the next summit , scheduled to be held in africa in 2010 .

" eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who bears final responsibility for the eu in the talks , quickly pointed out that the eu only wanted to sign interim deals by the end of the year , and that he and colleagues would personally conduct talks on longer-term deals with their african counterparts early in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters called on the eu to offer african countries a fair economic deal wary of china 's growing push into africa , the european union has been keen to nail down new trade agreements before the expiration of existing deals at year 's end . historic mood " let 's conclude the interim deals first - it 's already almost finished with almost all the countries involved , " barroso said .
" the discussion on epas will go on .
we understand the difficulties that exist when it comes to introducing a new regime : whenever there is change , there 's a problem , but we 're convinced that the epas are a good offer . " the wide-ranging eu-africa strategic partnership , approved at the meeting , sets out a series of eight areas in which the two continents should improve their cooperation , together with a long list of action plans that they are expected to implement by 2010 . both sides viewed the fact that they had managed to reach agreement on those broad goals , in spite of serious disagreements on individual points , as the most significant outcome of the event . " the mood created in lisbon will prove historic , because it marks a radical change , " kufuor concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 , without agreement on the key issue of trade , dealing a blow to efforts to forge a new economic partnership between the two continents . despite leaving the summit with an action plan and promise to meet again in three years instead of a trade agreement , european and african leaders praised the joint summit in lisbon as the launch of a new alliance . " without doubt , this summit is historic , because it represents a milestone in our relationship , " the summit 's host , portuguese prime minister jose socrates , said in his closing speech .
" a partnership has emerged , of two continents looking for a better future and a new era of political dialogue . " ghana 's president john kufuor , the african union 's current president , agreed the summit had witnessed frank exchanges but on an equal footing . " the relationship between europe and africa has been put on a new platform , " kufuor said .
" the two will now begin a new friendship and partnership that should have a very positive impact on the process of globalization . " second meeting ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another eu-africa meeting is slated for 2010 the two-day summit of 26 european and 53 african heads of government held talks on a sweeping range of issues , from energy and climate change to migration , science and security .
it was the two sides ' first meeting since 2000 , and only the second ever . at the end of the meeting they approved an eight-part agreement setting out how they should cooperate on those issues ahead of the next summit , scheduled to be held in africa in 2010 .
libya has already offered to host that summit . but the lisbon meeting was dominated by two issues : the state of democracy in zimbabwe and a bitter row over trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , which have been a bone of contention for over five years . merkel , mugabe exchange barbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe and merkel each received support from their continents ahead of the summit , zimbabwe seemed the more explosive issue .
eu leaders have long accused president robert mugabe of destroying his country 's democracy and economy , and britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to attend the summit because of mugabe 's presence . on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel accused mugabe 's regime of " damaging the image of the new africa " in comments echoed by the leaders of sweden , denmark and the netherlands . mugabe hit back on sunday , accusing his opponents of being brown 's " spokesmen " and of showing ignorance of zimbabwe in their speeches , and arrogance in their attitudes . " does the german chancellor and the pro-gordon gang of four really believe they have better knowledge of zimbabwe than the southern african development community -lrb- sadec -rrb- and the african union ?

" it is this arrogance that we are fighting against . " trade differences remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wade said there would be time to talk about new trade deals in the future but the second day of talks was dominated by the trade issue .
the eu and four african regions have been negotiating for five years on a package of deals - the epas - which are meant to replace earlier agreements the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- had ruled illegal . the wto had set a deadline for the end of the year for the old deals to be replaced .
several african states have said that the eu is using that as an excuse to force them into unfair deals , and on sunday they appeared close to walking away from negotiations . " let 's not talk about the economic partnership agreements !

" when we meet again , we 'll discuss things , the eu will present their epas , and we will present something else .

we understand the difficulties that exist when it comes to introducing a new regime : whenever there is change , there 's a problem , but we 're convinced that the epas are a good offer .

9 .
some observers have even called for a salary cap . social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- head kurt beck said saturday , dec .
8 , that his party was considering legislative ways to limit severance packages , often worth millions of euros , paid to business leaders . " i can understand people 's anger when managers get sent home with millions in compensation - even after a company is bankrupted , " beck told saturday 's bild zeitung , adding that while the business brass deserve fair pay the situation in some companies had gotten out of hand . beck 's comments come on the heels of chancellor angela merkel 's criticism of business directors who after failing their companies are rewarded with " fantastic bonuses . "
the head of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , merkel added that managers should be well paid as long as they " did a lot for their companies and their partners . " morals in the boardroom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany have called for more fairness from the country 's business leaders the european commission supported beck 's view .
vladimir spidla , the eu 's commissioner for employment and social affairs , told germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper that ethical business limits were " certainly exceeded " when top managers earn 100 times more than regular employees . in the interest of fairness to all , the head of germany 's protestant church , bishop wolfgang huber , called for a federal law limiting managers ' salaries . " it goes against every notion of fairness when one person 's salary could finance more than 100 jobs and a company has to cut jobs to save on costs , " he told the bild am sonntag . a survey published in the paper said about two-thirds of germans would be in favor of a salary cap . tact , transparency needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does not require public companies to reveal what they pay individual managers but federal economics minister michael glos , a cdu member , said private companies - not politicians - should determine what constitutes a fair severance package . " i am fundamentally against the state handing down rules from on high , " he told the bild .
" instead i hope for tact and a sense of responsibility . " interior minister wolfgang schäuble , also of the cdu , said he was against legislating managers ' pay and on sunday called on companies to stop writing " unacceptably high " paychecks . he also said publically listed companies should disclose how much they pay their directors and that laws forcing companies unwilling to do so was in an interview with the welt am sonntag , he said , " transparency rules making it mandatory for public companies to disclose the actual payments made to managers " would be " worth considering .

9 , without agreement on the key issue of trade , dealing a blow to efforts to forge a new economic partnership between the two continents . despite leaving the summit with an action plan and promise to meet again in three years instead of a trade agreement , european and african leaders praised the joint summit in lisbon as the launch of a new alliance . " without doubt , this summit is historic , because it represents a milestone in our relationship , " the summit 's host , portuguese prime minister jose socrates , said in his closing speech .
" a partnership has emerged , of two continents looking for a better future and a new era of political dialogue . " ghana 's president john kufuor , the african union 's current president , agreed the summit had witnessed frank exchanges but on an equal footing . " the relationship between europe and africa has been put on a new platform , " kufuor said .
" the two will now begin a new friendship and partnership that should have a very positive impact on the process of globalization . " second meeting ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another eu-africa meeting is slated for 2010 the two-day summit of 26 european and 53 african heads of government held talks on a sweeping range of issues , from energy and climate change to migration , science and security .
it was the two sides ' first meeting since 2000 , and only the second ever . at the end of the meeting they approved an eight-part agreement setting out how they should cooperate on those issues ahead of the next summit , scheduled to be held in africa in 2010 .
libya has already offered to host that summit . but the lisbon meeting was dominated by two issues : the state of democracy in zimbabwe and a bitter row over trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , which have been a bone of contention for over five years . merkel , mugabe exchange barbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe and merkel each received support from their continents ahead of the summit , zimbabwe seemed the more explosive issue .
eu leaders have long accused president robert mugabe of destroying his country 's democracy and economy , and britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to attend the summit because of mugabe 's presence . on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel accused mugabe 's regime of " damaging the image of the new africa " in comments echoed by the leaders of sweden , denmark and the netherlands . mugabe hit back on sunday , accusing his opponents of being brown 's " spokesmen " and of showing ignorance of zimbabwe in their speeches , and arrogance in their attitudes . " does the german chancellor and the pro-gordon gang of four really believe they have better knowledge of zimbabwe than the southern african development community -lrb- sadec -rrb- and the african union ? " he asked .
" it is this arrogance that we are fighting against . " trade differences remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wade said there would be time to talk about new trade deals in the future but the second day of talks was dominated by the trade issue .
the eu and four african regions have been negotiating for five years on a package of deals - the epas - which are meant to replace earlier agreements the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- had ruled illegal . the wto had set a deadline for the end of the year for the old deals to be replaced .
several african states have said that the eu is using that as an excuse to force them into unfair deals , and on sunday they appeared close to walking away from negotiations . " let 's not talk about the economic partnership agreements !
we 've said we rejected them - for us , it 's finished , " president maitre abdoulaye wade of senegal told journalists .
" when we meet again , we 'll discuss things , the eu will present their epas , and we will present something else . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who bears final responsibility for the eu in the talks , quickly pointed out that the eu only wanted to sign interim deals by the end of the year , and that he and colleagues would personally conduct talks on longer-term deals with their african counterparts early in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters called on the eu to offer african countries a fair economic deal wary of china 's growing push into africa , the european union has been keen to nail down new trade agreements before the expiration of existing deals at year 's end . historic mood " let 's conclude the interim deals first - it 's already almost finished with almost all the countries involved , " barroso said .
" the discussion on epas will go on .
we understand the difficulties that exist when it comes to introducing a new regime : whenever there is change , there 's a problem , but we 're convinced that the epas are a good offer . " the wide-ranging eu-africa strategic partnership , approved at the meeting , sets out a series of eight areas in which the two continents should improve their cooperation , together with a long list of action plans that they are expected to implement by 2010 . both sides viewed the fact that they had managed to reach agreement on those broad goals , in spite of serious disagreements on individual points , as the most significant outcome of the event .

we 've said we rejected them - for us , it 's finished , " president maitre abdoulaye wade of senegal told journalists .
" when we meet again , we 'll discuss things , the eu will present their epas , and we will present something else . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who bears final responsibility for the eu in the talks , quickly pointed out that the eu only wanted to sign interim deals by the end of the year , and that he and colleagues would personally conduct talks on longer-term deals with their african counterparts early in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters called on the eu to offer african countries a fair economic deal wary of china 's growing push into africa , the european union has been keen to nail down new trade agreements before the expiration of existing deals at year 's end . historic mood " let 's conclude the interim deals first - it 's already almost finished with almost all the countries involved , " barroso said .
" the discussion on epas will go on .
we understand the difficulties that exist when it comes to introducing a new regime : whenever there is change , there 's a problem , but we 're convinced that the epas are a good offer . " the wide-ranging eu-africa strategic partnership , approved at the meeting , sets out a series of eight areas in which the two continents should improve their cooperation , together with a long list of action plans that they are expected to implement by 2010 . both sides viewed the fact that they had managed to reach agreement on those broad goals , in spite of serious disagreements on individual points , as the most significant outcome of the event . " the mood created in lisbon will prove historic , because it marks a radical change , " kufuor concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 , without agreement on the key issue of trade , dealing a blow to efforts to forge a new economic partnership between the two continents . despite leaving the summit with an action plan and promise to meet again in three years instead of a trade agreement , european and african leaders praised the joint summit in lisbon as the launch of a new alliance . " without doubt , this summit is historic , because it represents a milestone in our relationship , " the summit 's host , portuguese prime minister jose socrates , said in his closing speech .
" a partnership has emerged , of two continents looking for a better future and a new era of political dialogue . " ghana 's president john kufuor , the african union 's current president , agreed the summit had witnessed frank exchanges but on an equal footing . " the relationship between europe and africa has been put on a new platform , " kufuor said .
" the two will now begin a new friendship and partnership that should have a very positive impact on the process of globalization . " second meeting ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another eu-africa meeting is slated for 2010 the two-day summit of 26 european and 53 african heads of government held talks on a sweeping range of issues , from energy and climate change to migration , science and security .
it was the two sides ' first meeting since 2000 , and only the second ever . at the end of the meeting they approved an eight-part agreement setting out how they should cooperate on those issues ahead of the next summit , scheduled to be held in africa in 2010 .
libya has already offered to host that summit . but the lisbon meeting was dominated by two issues : the state of democracy in zimbabwe and a bitter row over trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , which have been a bone of contention for over five years . merkel , mugabe exchange barbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe and merkel each received support from their continents ahead of the summit , zimbabwe seemed the more explosive issue .
eu leaders have long accused president robert mugabe of destroying his country 's democracy and economy , and britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to attend the summit because of mugabe 's presence . on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel accused mugabe 's regime of " damaging the image of the new africa " in comments echoed by the leaders of sweden , denmark and the netherlands . mugabe hit back on sunday , accusing his opponents of being brown 's " spokesmen " and of showing ignorance of zimbabwe in their speeches , and arrogance in their attitudes . " does the german chancellor and the pro-gordon gang of four really believe they have better knowledge of zimbabwe than the southern african development community -lrb- sadec -rrb- and the african union ? " he asked .
" it is this arrogance that we are fighting against . " trade differences remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wade said there would be time to talk about new trade deals in the future but the second day of talks was dominated by the trade issue .
the eu and four african regions have been negotiating for five years on a package of deals - the epas - which are meant to replace earlier agreements the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- had ruled illegal . the wto had set a deadline for the end of the year for the old deals to be replaced .
several african states have said that the eu is using that as an excuse to force them into unfair deals , and on sunday they appeared close to walking away from negotiations . " let 's not talk about the economic partnership agreements !
we 've said we rejected them - for us , it 's finished , " president maitre abdoulaye wade of senegal told journalists .
" when we meet again , we 'll discuss things , the eu will present their epas , and we will present something else . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who bears final responsibility for the eu in the talks , quickly pointed out that the eu only wanted to sign interim deals by the end of the year , and that he and colleagues would personally conduct talks on longer-term deals with their african counterparts early in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters called on the eu to offer african countries a fair economic deal wary of china 's growing push into africa , the european union has been keen to nail down new trade agreements before the expiration of existing deals at year 's end . historic mood " let 's conclude the interim deals first - it 's already almost finished with almost all the countries involved , " barroso said .
" the discussion on epas will go on .
we understand the difficulties that exist when it comes to introducing a new regime : whenever there is change , there 's a problem , but we 're convinced that the epas are a good offer . " the wide-ranging eu-africa strategic partnership , approved at the meeting , sets out a series of eight areas in which the two continents should improve their cooperation , together with a long list of action plans that they are expected to implement by 2010 . both sides viewed the fact that they had managed to reach agreement on those broad goals , in spite of serious disagreements on individual points , as the most significant outcome of the event . " the mood created in lisbon will prove historic , because it marks a radical change , " kufuor concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 09.12.2007 eu-africa summit ends with meager results großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit , involving nearly 80 countries , ended without an agreement on economic issues africa and europe 's first summit in seven years ended on sunday , dec .
9 , without agreement on the key issue of trade , dealing a blow to efforts to forge a new economic partnership between the two continents . despite leaving the summit with an action plan and promise to meet again in three years instead of a trade agreement , european and african leaders praised the joint summit in lisbon as the launch of a new alliance . " without doubt , this summit is historic , because it represents a milestone in our relationship , " the summit 's host , portuguese prime minister jose socrates , said in his closing speech .
" a partnership has emerged , of two continents looking for a better future and a new era of political dialogue . " ghana 's president john kufuor , the african union 's current president , agreed the summit had witnessed frank exchanges but on an equal footing . " the relationship between europe and africa has been put on a new platform , " kufuor said .
" the two will now begin a new friendship and partnership that should have a very positive impact on the process of globalization . " second meeting ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another eu-africa meeting is slated for 2010 the two-day summit of 26 european and 53 african heads of government held talks on a sweeping range of issues , from energy and climate change to migration , science and security .
it was the two sides ' first meeting since 2000 , and only the second ever . at the end of the meeting they approved an eight-part agreement setting out how they should cooperate on those issues ahead of the next summit , scheduled to be held in africa in 2010 .
libya has already offered to host that summit . but the lisbon meeting was dominated by two issues : the state of democracy in zimbabwe and a bitter row over trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , which have been a bone of contention for over five years . merkel , mugabe exchange barbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe and merkel each received support from their continents ahead of the summit , zimbabwe seemed the more explosive issue .
eu leaders have long accused president robert mugabe of destroying his country 's democracy and economy , and britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to attend the summit because of mugabe 's presence . on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel accused mugabe 's regime of " damaging the image of the new africa " in comments echoed by the leaders of sweden , denmark and the netherlands . mugabe hit back on sunday , accusing his opponents of being brown 's " spokesmen " and of showing ignorance of zimbabwe in their speeches , and arrogance in their attitudes . " does the german chancellor and the pro-gordon gang of four really believe they have better knowledge of zimbabwe than the southern african development community -lrb- sadec -rrb- and the african union ? " he asked .
" it is this arrogance that we are fighting against . " trade differences remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wade said there would be time to talk about new trade deals in the future but the second day of talks was dominated by the trade issue .
the eu and four african regions have been negotiating for five years on a package of deals - the epas - which are meant to replace earlier agreements the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- had ruled illegal . the wto had set a deadline for the end of the year for the old deals to be replaced .
several african states have said that the eu is using that as an excuse to force them into unfair deals , and on sunday they appeared close to walking away from negotiations . " let 's not talk about the economic partnership agreements !
we 've said we rejected them - for us , it 's finished , " president maitre abdoulaye wade of senegal told journalists .
" when we meet again , we 'll discuss things , the eu will present their epas , and we will present something else . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who bears final responsibility for the eu in the talks , quickly pointed out that the eu only wanted to sign interim deals by the end of the year , and that he and colleagues would personally conduct talks on longer-term deals with their african counterparts early in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters called on the eu to offer african countries a fair economic deal wary of china 's growing push into africa , the european union has been keen to nail down new trade agreements before the expiration of existing deals at year 's end . historic mood " let 's conclude the interim deals first - it 's already almost finished with almost all the countries involved , " barroso said .
" the discussion on epas will go on .

9 , without agreement on the key issue of trade , dealing a blow to efforts to forge a new economic partnership between the two continents . despite leaving the summit with an action plan and promise to meet again in three years instead of a trade agreement , european and african leaders praised the joint summit in lisbon as the launch of a new alliance . " without doubt , this summit is historic , because it represents a milestone in our relationship , " the summit 's host , portuguese prime minister jose socrates , said in his closing speech .
" a partnership has emerged , of two continents looking for a better future and a new era of political dialogue . " ghana 's president john kufuor , the african union 's current president , agreed the summit had witnessed frank exchanges but on an equal footing . " the relationship between europe and africa has been put on a new platform , " kufuor said .
" the two will now begin a new friendship and partnership that should have a very positive impact on the process of globalization . " second meeting ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another eu-africa meeting is slated for 2010 the two-day summit of 26 european and 53 african heads of government held talks on a sweeping range of issues , from energy and climate change to migration , science and security .
it was the two sides ' first meeting since 2000 , and only the second ever . at the end of the meeting they approved an eight-part agreement setting out how they should cooperate on those issues ahead of the next summit , scheduled to be held in africa in 2010 .
libya has already offered to host that summit . but the lisbon meeting was dominated by two issues : the state of democracy in zimbabwe and a bitter row over trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , which have been a bone of contention for over five years . merkel , mugabe exchange barbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe and merkel each received support from their continents ahead of the summit , zimbabwe seemed the more explosive issue .
eu leaders have long accused president robert mugabe of destroying his country 's democracy and economy , and britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to attend the summit because of mugabe 's presence . on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel accused mugabe 's regime of " damaging the image of the new africa " in comments echoed by the leaders of sweden , denmark and the netherlands . mugabe hit back on sunday , accusing his opponents of being brown 's " spokesmen " and of showing ignorance of zimbabwe in their speeches , and arrogance in their attitudes . " does the german chancellor and the pro-gordon gang of four really believe they have better knowledge of zimbabwe than the southern african development community -lrb- sadec -rrb- and the african union ? " he asked .
" it is this arrogance that we are fighting against . " trade differences remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wade said there would be time to talk about new trade deals in the future but the second day of talks was dominated by the trade issue .
the eu and four african regions have been negotiating for five years on a package of deals - the epas - which are meant to replace earlier agreements the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- had ruled illegal . the wto had set a deadline for the end of the year for the old deals to be replaced .
several african states have said that the eu is using that as an excuse to force them into unfair deals , and on sunday they appeared close to walking away from negotiations . " let 's not talk about the economic partnership agreements !
we 've said we rejected them - for us , it 's finished , " president maitre abdoulaye wade of senegal told journalists .
" when we meet again , we 'll discuss things , the eu will present their epas , and we will present something else . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who bears final responsibility for the eu in the talks , quickly pointed out that the eu only wanted to sign interim deals by the end of the year , and that he and colleagues would personally conduct talks on longer-term deals with their african counterparts early in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters called on the eu to offer african countries a fair economic deal wary of china 's growing push into africa , the european union has been keen to nail down new trade agreements before the expiration of existing deals at year 's end . historic mood " let 's conclude the interim deals first - it 's already almost finished with almost all the countries involved , " barroso said .

" i can understand people 's anger when managers get sent home with millions in compensation - even after a company is bankrupted , " beck told saturday 's bild zeitung , adding that while the business brass deserve fair pay the situation in some companies had gotten out of hand . beck 's comments come on the heels of chancellor angela merkel 's criticism of business directors who after failing their companies are rewarded with " fantastic bonuses .

" it goes against every notion of fairness when one person 's salary could finance more than 100 jobs and a company has to cut jobs to save on costs , " he told the bild am sonntag . a survey published in the paper said about two-thirds of germans would be in favor of a salary cap . tact , transparency needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does not require public companies to reveal what they pay individual managers but federal economics minister michael glos , a cdu member , said private companies - not politicians - should determine what constitutes a fair severance package . " i am fundamentally against the state handing down rules from on high , " he told the bild .
" instead i hope for tact and a sense of responsibility . " interior minister wolfgang schäuble , also of the cdu , said he was against legislating managers ' pay and on sunday called on companies to stop writing " unacceptably high " paychecks . he also said publically listed companies should disclose how much they pay their directors and that laws forcing companies unwilling to do so was in an interview with the welt am sonntag , he said , " transparency rules making it mandatory for public companies to disclose the actual payments made to managers " would be " worth considering .

9 , without agreement on the key issue of trade , dealing a blow to efforts to forge a new economic partnership between the two continents . despite leaving the summit with an action plan and promise to meet again in three years instead of a trade agreement , european and african leaders praised the joint summit in lisbon as the launch of a new alliance . " without doubt , this summit is historic , because it represents a milestone in our relationship , " the summit 's host , portuguese prime minister jose socrates , said in his closing speech .
" a partnership has emerged , of two continents looking for a better future and a new era of political dialogue . " ghana 's president john kufuor , the african union 's current president , agreed the summit had witnessed frank exchanges but on an equal footing . " the relationship between europe and africa has been put on a new platform , " kufuor said .
" the two will now begin a new friendship and partnership that should have a very positive impact on the process of globalization . " second meeting ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another eu-africa meeting is slated for 2010 the two-day summit of 26 european and 53 african heads of government held talks on a sweeping range of issues , from energy and climate change to migration , science and security .
it was the two sides ' first meeting since 2000 , and only the second ever . at the end of the meeting they approved an eight-part agreement setting out how they should cooperate on those issues ahead of the next summit , scheduled to be held in africa in 2010 .
libya has already offered to host that summit . but the lisbon meeting was dominated by two issues : the state of democracy in zimbabwe and a bitter row over trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , which have been a bone of contention for over five years . merkel , mugabe exchange barbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe and merkel each received support from their continents ahead of the summit , zimbabwe seemed the more explosive issue .
eu leaders have long accused president robert mugabe of destroying his country 's democracy and economy , and britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to attend the summit because of mugabe 's presence . on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel accused mugabe 's regime of " damaging the image of the new africa " in comments echoed by the leaders of sweden , denmark and the netherlands . mugabe hit back on sunday , accusing his opponents of being brown 's " spokesmen " and of showing ignorance of zimbabwe in their speeches , and arrogance in their attitudes . " does the german chancellor and the pro-gordon gang of four really believe they have better knowledge of zimbabwe than the southern african development community -lrb- sadec -rrb- and the african union ?

" it is this arrogance that we are fighting against . " trade differences remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wade said there would be time to talk about new trade deals in the future but the second day of talks was dominated by the trade issue .
the eu and four african regions have been negotiating for five years on a package of deals - the epas - which are meant to replace earlier agreements the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- had ruled illegal . the wto had set a deadline for the end of the year for the old deals to be replaced .
several african states have said that the eu is using that as an excuse to force them into unfair deals , and on sunday they appeared close to walking away from negotiations . " let 's not talk about the economic partnership agreements !
we 've said we rejected them - for us , it 's finished , " president maitre abdoulaye wade of senegal told journalists .
" when we meet again , we 'll discuss things , the eu will present their epas , and we will present something else .

some observers have even called for a salary cap . social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- head kurt beck said saturday , dec .

" i can understand people 's anger when managers get sent home with millions in compensation - even after a company is bankrupted , " beck told saturday 's bild zeitung , adding that while the business brass deserve fair pay the situation in some companies had gotten out of hand . beck 's comments come on the heels of chancellor angela merkel 's criticism of business directors who after failing their companies are rewarded with " fantastic bonuses . "
the head of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , merkel added that managers should be well paid as long as they " did a lot for their companies and their partners .

" it goes against every notion of fairness when one person 's salary could finance more than 100 jobs and a company has to cut jobs to save on costs , " he told the bild am sonntag . a survey published in the paper said about two-thirds of germans would be in favor of a salary cap . tact , transparency needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does not require public companies to reveal what they pay individual managers but federal economics minister michael glos , a cdu member , said private companies - not politicians - should determine what constitutes a fair severance package . " i am fundamentally against the state handing down rules from on high , " he told the bild .
" instead i hope for tact and a sense of responsibility . " interior minister wolfgang schäuble , also of the cdu , said he was against legislating managers ' pay and on sunday called on companies to stop writing " unacceptably high " paychecks . he also said publically listed companies should disclose how much they pay their directors and that laws forcing companies unwilling to do so was in an interview with the welt am sonntag , he said , " transparency rules making it mandatory for public companies to disclose the actual payments made to managers " would be " worth considering .

9 , without agreement on the key issue of trade , dealing a blow to efforts to forge a new economic partnership between the two continents . despite leaving the summit with an action plan and promise to meet again in three years instead of a trade agreement , european and african leaders praised the joint summit in lisbon as the launch of a new alliance . " without doubt , this summit is historic , because it represents a milestone in our relationship , " the summit 's host , portuguese prime minister jose socrates , said in his closing speech .
" a partnership has emerged , of two continents looking for a better future and a new era of political dialogue . " ghana 's president john kufuor , the african union 's current president , agreed the summit had witnessed frank exchanges but on an equal footing . " the relationship between europe and africa has been put on a new platform , " kufuor said .
" the two will now begin a new friendship and partnership that should have a very positive impact on the process of globalization . " second meeting ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another eu-africa meeting is slated for 2010 the two-day summit of 26 european and 53 african heads of government held talks on a sweeping range of issues , from energy and climate change to migration , science and security .
it was the two sides ' first meeting since 2000 , and only the second ever . at the end of the meeting they approved an eight-part agreement setting out how they should cooperate on those issues ahead of the next summit , scheduled to be held in africa in 2010 .
libya has already offered to host that summit . but the lisbon meeting was dominated by two issues : the state of democracy in zimbabwe and a bitter row over trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , which have been a bone of contention for over five years . merkel , mugabe exchange barbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe and merkel each received support from their continents ahead of the summit , zimbabwe seemed the more explosive issue .
eu leaders have long accused president robert mugabe of destroying his country 's democracy and economy , and britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to attend the summit because of mugabe 's presence . on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel accused mugabe 's regime of " damaging the image of the new africa " in comments echoed by the leaders of sweden , denmark and the netherlands . mugabe hit back on sunday , accusing his opponents of being brown 's " spokesmen " and of showing ignorance of zimbabwe in their speeches , and arrogance in their attitudes . " does the german chancellor and the pro-gordon gang of four really believe they have better knowledge of zimbabwe than the southern african development community -lrb- sadec -rrb- and the african union ? " he asked .
" it is this arrogance that we are fighting against . " trade differences remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wade said there would be time to talk about new trade deals in the future but the second day of talks was dominated by the trade issue .
the eu and four african regions have been negotiating for five years on a package of deals - the epas - which are meant to replace earlier agreements the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- had ruled illegal . the wto had set a deadline for the end of the year for the old deals to be replaced .
several african states have said that the eu is using that as an excuse to force them into unfair deals , and on sunday they appeared close to walking away from negotiations . " let 's not talk about the economic partnership agreements !
we 've said we rejected them - for us , it 's finished , " president maitre abdoulaye wade of senegal told journalists .
" when we meet again , we 'll discuss things , the eu will present their epas , and we will present something else . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who bears final responsibility for the eu in the talks , quickly pointed out that the eu only wanted to sign interim deals by the end of the year , and that he and colleagues would personally conduct talks on longer-term deals with their african counterparts early in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters called on the eu to offer african countries a fair economic deal wary of china 's growing push into africa , the european union has been keen to nail down new trade agreements before the expiration of existing deals at year 's end . historic mood " let 's conclude the interim deals first - it 's already almost finished with almost all the countries involved , " barroso said .
" the discussion on epas will go on .
we understand the difficulties that exist when it comes to introducing a new regime : whenever there is change , there 's a problem , but we 're convinced that the epas are a good offer . " the wide-ranging eu-africa strategic partnership , approved at the meeting , sets out a series of eight areas in which the two continents should improve their cooperation , together with a long list of action plans that they are expected to implement by 2010 . both sides viewed the fact that they had managed to reach agreement on those broad goals , in spite of serious disagreements on individual points , as the most significant outcome of the event .

9 , without agreement on the key issue of trade , dealing a blow to efforts to forge a new economic partnership between the two continents . despite leaving the summit with an action plan and promise to meet again in three years instead of a trade agreement , european and african leaders praised the joint summit in lisbon as the launch of a new alliance . " without doubt , this summit is historic , because it represents a milestone in our relationship , " the summit 's host , portuguese prime minister jose socrates , said in his closing speech .
" a partnership has emerged , of two continents looking for a better future and a new era of political dialogue . " ghana 's president john kufuor , the african union 's current president , agreed the summit had witnessed frank exchanges but on an equal footing . " the relationship between europe and africa has been put on a new platform , " kufuor said .
" the two will now begin a new friendship and partnership that should have a very positive impact on the process of globalization . " second meeting ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another eu-africa meeting is slated for 2010 the two-day summit of 26 european and 53 african heads of government held talks on a sweeping range of issues , from energy and climate change to migration , science and security .
it was the two sides ' first meeting since 2000 , and only the second ever . at the end of the meeting they approved an eight-part agreement setting out how they should cooperate on those issues ahead of the next summit , scheduled to be held in africa in 2010 .
libya has already offered to host that summit . but the lisbon meeting was dominated by two issues : the state of democracy in zimbabwe and a bitter row over trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , which have been a bone of contention for over five years . merkel , mugabe exchange barbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe and merkel each received support from their continents ahead of the summit , zimbabwe seemed the more explosive issue .
eu leaders have long accused president robert mugabe of destroying his country 's democracy and economy , and britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to attend the summit because of mugabe 's presence . on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel accused mugabe 's regime of " damaging the image of the new africa " in comments echoed by the leaders of sweden , denmark and the netherlands . mugabe hit back on sunday , accusing his opponents of being brown 's " spokesmen " and of showing ignorance of zimbabwe in their speeches , and arrogance in their attitudes . " does the german chancellor and the pro-gordon gang of four really believe they have better knowledge of zimbabwe than the southern african development community -lrb- sadec -rrb- and the african union ? " he asked .
" it is this arrogance that we are fighting against . " trade differences remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wade said there would be time to talk about new trade deals in the future but the second day of talks was dominated by the trade issue .
the eu and four african regions have been negotiating for five years on a package of deals - the epas - which are meant to replace earlier agreements the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- had ruled illegal . the wto had set a deadline for the end of the year for the old deals to be replaced .
several african states have said that the eu is using that as an excuse to force them into unfair deals , and on sunday they appeared close to walking away from negotiations . " let 's not talk about the economic partnership agreements !
we 've said we rejected them - for us , it 's finished , " president maitre abdoulaye wade of senegal told journalists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 09.12.2007 eu-africa summit ends with meager results großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit , involving nearly 80 countries , ended without an agreement on economic issues africa and europe 's first summit in seven years ended on sunday , dec .
9 , without agreement on the key issue of trade , dealing a blow to efforts to forge a new economic partnership between the two continents . despite leaving the summit with an action plan and promise to meet again in three years instead of a trade agreement , european and african leaders praised the joint summit in lisbon as the launch of a new alliance . " without doubt , this summit is historic , because it represents a milestone in our relationship , " the summit 's host , portuguese prime minister jose socrates , said in his closing speech .
" a partnership has emerged , of two continents looking for a better future and a new era of political dialogue . " ghana 's president john kufuor , the african union 's current president , agreed the summit had witnessed frank exchanges but on an equal footing . " the relationship between europe and africa has been put on a new platform , " kufuor said .
" the two will now begin a new friendship and partnership that should have a very positive impact on the process of globalization . " second meeting ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another eu-africa meeting is slated for 2010 the two-day summit of 26 european and 53 african heads of government held talks on a sweeping range of issues , from energy and climate change to migration , science and security .
it was the two sides ' first meeting since 2000 , and only the second ever . at the end of the meeting they approved an eight-part agreement setting out how they should cooperate on those issues ahead of the next summit , scheduled to be held in africa in 2010 .
libya has already offered to host that summit . but the lisbon meeting was dominated by two issues : the state of democracy in zimbabwe and a bitter row over trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , which have been a bone of contention for over five years . merkel , mugabe exchange barbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe and merkel each received support from their continents ahead of the summit , zimbabwe seemed the more explosive issue .
eu leaders have long accused president robert mugabe of destroying his country 's democracy and economy , and britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to attend the summit because of mugabe 's presence . on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel accused mugabe 's regime of " damaging the image of the new africa " in comments echoed by the leaders of sweden , denmark and the netherlands . mugabe hit back on sunday , accusing his opponents of being brown 's " spokesmen " and of showing ignorance of zimbabwe in their speeches , and arrogance in their attitudes . " does the german chancellor and the pro-gordon gang of four really believe they have better knowledge of zimbabwe than the southern african development community -lrb- sadec -rrb- and the african union ? " he asked .
" it is this arrogance that we are fighting against . " trade differences remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wade said there would be time to talk about new trade deals in the future but the second day of talks was dominated by the trade issue .
the eu and four african regions have been negotiating for five years on a package of deals - the epas - which are meant to replace earlier agreements the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- had ruled illegal . the wto had set a deadline for the end of the year for the old deals to be replaced .
several african states have said that the eu is using that as an excuse to force them into unfair deals , and on sunday they appeared close to walking away from negotiations . " let 's not talk about the economic partnership agreements !
we 've said we rejected them - for us , it 's finished , " president maitre abdoulaye wade of senegal told journalists .
" when we meet again , we 'll discuss things , the eu will present their epas , and we will present something else . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who bears final responsibility for the eu in the talks , quickly pointed out that the eu only wanted to sign interim deals by the end of the year , and that he and colleagues would personally conduct talks on longer-term deals with their african counterparts early in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters called on the eu to offer african countries a fair economic deal wary of china 's growing push into africa , the european union has been keen to nail down new trade agreements before the expiration of existing deals at year 's end . historic mood " let 's conclude the interim deals first - it 's already almost finished with almost all the countries involved , " barroso said .
" the discussion on epas will go on .
we understand the difficulties that exist when it comes to introducing a new regime : whenever there is change , there 's a problem , but we 're convinced that the epas are a good offer . " the wide-ranging eu-africa strategic partnership , approved at the meeting , sets out a series of eight areas in which the two continents should improve their cooperation , together with a long list of action plans that they are expected to implement by 2010 . both sides viewed the fact that they had managed to reach agreement on those broad goals , in spite of serious disagreements on individual points , as the most significant outcome of the event . " the mood created in lisbon will prove historic , because it marks a radical change , " kufuor concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the probe , part of a 10-year plan for children in england to be published next week , comes amid fears about the commercialisation of childhood .
it will look at evidence of links between adverts and dissatisfaction , anxiety , eating disorders and drinking .
children see some 10,000 tv adverts a year and recognise 400 brands by age 10 , children 's secretary ed balls says .
' sexualisation ' of girls he said many parents were concerned about youngsters being bombarded with adverts and media images that encouraged the " sexualisation " of girls .
mr balls said the inquiry would be carried out by leading child psychologists and academics .
they would look at the cumulative impact of advertising on different aspects of childhood and well-being , to see whether commercial pressure had a " negative impact " .
" we need to look at the evidence around commercialisation before we jump to any conclusions , " he said .
mr balls said a ministerial group would examine the links between advertising and binge-drinking among children , including the effects of a " spike " of alcohol adverts on television between 4pm and 6pm .
mr balls said he would not rule out introducing new regulations , but stopped short of suggesting a ban on alcohol advertising before the 9pm watershed .
10-year plan a survey by education inspectors ofsted last month found that one in five 10 to 15-year-olds regularly got drunk .
the bbc 's james westhead suggested that , rather than trying to ban adverts targeted at children , the government was more likely to try to foster a sense of responsibility among advertisers .

it is set to look at all aspects of children 's lives and could include changes in the design of schools , as well as attempts to get parents more directly involved in school activities and to improve the provision of safe play areas .
it is also expected to include a review of sats tests and the primary school curriculum as well as an announcement of free nursery care for children as young as two from poorer families .

janis winehouse urged her daughter to " pick up that phone and tell me what 's troubling you " in the message , published in the news of the world .
" early fame has overwhelmed you , it 's dizzied you and muddled your mind , " it said , adding : " i want you back . "
the star recently scrapped her tour after being told to take complete rest .
she has been in the headlines all year after reports of drug use , rehabilitation treatment and cancelled performances - as well as awards success and a best-selling album .
janis winehouse said she had spoken to her daughter recently but was writing the letter because amy would not get help unless she asked for it herself . "
you think you 're strong enough to get through this on your own , darling , but you 're not " janis winehouse " this letter is my way of making sure that you know that all you have to do is come to us , amy , and we 'll do everything in our power to get you well again .
" after all , you are still my baby and you always will be , " she wrote , reminding amy of how stubborn she could be as a child .
the letter continued : " wherever you are , whatever you need , we 're here for you day and night .
i hope you know that .
" we were terrified after we saw those pictures of you earlier this week , wandering the freezing streets of london at dawn in your underwear .
all i wanted to do was rush into those pictures and wrap you up in a big , warm blanket . "
janis winehouse told her daughter she was still " young and vulnerable " even though she was a superstar .
" remember you 're just an ordinary human being , no stronger than any of the rest of us , " she said .
" you think you 're strong enough to get through this on your own , darling , but you 're not .
" i want you back , and i 'll make you fitter and stronger .
i 'd like nothing better than to have you home and help you put on a bit of weight with some wholesome home cooking . "
the singer 's father mitch has been one of her staunchest defenders in the past , at her side at court hearings and award ceremonies .
janis wrote : " me and your father , and your brother alex all want you to be happy and quickly restored to full health .
for the moment , that 's all of our priorities .
" we are concerned , but we 're not panicking .
you 've got to see things in your own time and i 'm sure you will . "
she also said the singer 's husband blake fielder-civil " might not be my favourite person " - but " if you two are destined to be together forever , then so be it " .
mr fielder-civil is currently in custody after being charged with assaulting a pub landlord and perverting the course of justice .
amy winehouse , 24 , has called off all gigs and public appearances for the rest of the year .
" i ca n't give it my all on stage without my blake , " she explained .
" i 'm so sorry but i do n't want to do the shows half-heartedly - i love singing .
" my husband is everything to me and without him it 's just not the same . "
winehouse has the uk 's biggest-selling album of the year so far , and has just been nominated for six prestigious grammy awards - a record for a female british artist .
a spokesperson for the star said : " amy is thrilled to be nominated for six grammys and is very much hoping to attend .
she is determined to be ready and well for that performance . "
